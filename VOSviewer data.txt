TI The role of epitexts in drama translation
SO JOURNAL OF SPECIALISED TRANSLATION
AB In recent years, the notion of paratranslation has grown in Translation Studies, particularly in the literary field. Nevertheless, little attention has been paid to the effect that paratextual components - peritextual and epitextual - (Genette 1997) may have on the rendering of theatrical texts into another language, especially if these texts are intended for performance.
   This article will seek to deal with the issue of paratranslation in the theatre, and more specifically with the potential influence of epitexts on the reception of a particular stage play in a different culture, as well as with the significance of the figure of the translator in the process. Two recent British performances of the Spanish classic Life is a Dream, based on two different translations, have been used by way of example. The results will show how reviews, webpages, videos, posters, flyers and programmes can add to the manner in which a particular play is perceived in the eyes of its target audiences, and to what extent the final outcome may be felt as part of the recipient theatrical culture.

TI Theatrical translation or theatrical adaptation? Staging Noises Off in
   Italy
SO JOURNAL OF ADAPTATION IN FILM & PERFORMANCE
AB The distinction between translation and adaptation is generally dependent on the amount of rewriting and independence of the target text, but the intercultural nature of theatrical translation and its varied addressees (actors and target audience) proves that drama requires a flexible approach to the process conducive to the target play. This article aims to demonstrate that the dramaturgical decisions related to the target play influence the balance between translation and adaptation in stage translation, which pursues a target-oriented approach. Rumori Fuori Scena, the Italian version of Michael Frayn's Noises Off, serves as the case study for a contrastive analysis that includes the source text and the performed play. Considering that the practitioners' experience is of utmost importance to fully understand the expectations on the translation and the identity of the target play: the practitioner's perspective unlocks new aspects relating to the borders between theatrical adaptation and translation.

TI The Family Reunion as a turning point in T. S. Eliot's Verse Drama:
   Analysis and Suggestions for Translation
SO ALICANTE JOURNAL OF ENGLISH STUDIES-REVISTA ALICANTINA DE ESTUDIOS
   INGLESES
AB T. S. Eliot wrote The Family Reunion (1939) while he composed the Four Quartets, twelve years after his conversion to Anglo-Catholicism in 1927. The play erects a bridge between the author's early stage productions (Sweeney Agonistes, The Rock and Murder in the Cathedral) and the later society plays (The Cocktail Party, The Confidential Clerk and The Elder Statesman). Moreover, in his 1951 essay "Poetry and Drama," Eliot delves into the strengths and weaknesses of The Family Reunion and links this play with his own experiments with a "conversational line" which introduces popular theatrical conventions wrapped in the patterns of poetry that may appeal to theatre-goers. This paper deals with Eliot's proposals for verse drama present in an incipient form in The Family Reunion, and explores the possible ways of translating these resources into Spanish. It focuses on Eliot's own explanations in "Poetry and Drama" about the way in which to adapt blank verse to the stage. Furthermore, this essay explores metrical concepts such as stress and caesura and applies them to wider aspects concerning dramatic patterns and inner/ outer voice in characters.

TI Theatre translation as performance
SO TARGET-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSLATION STUDIES
AB In 2008, the Finnish National Theatre produced the Lebanese/Canadian playwright Wajdi Mouawad's tragic play Incendies in Finnish. The advertisements, newspaper pre-reviews and reviews named Reita Lounatvuori, a well-known Finnish theatre translator, as the author of the translation. However, several other people were also involved in the translation process before Mouawad's text reached the stage. In my article, I offer an empirical study of the process of translation of Incendies into Finnish to argue that translations in the theatre are not objects of art but products of art worlds, bearing the fingerprints of many subjectivities. To support my argument, I draw on Actor-Network Theory, as recently developed in the context of translation sociology (Buzelin 2007, 2005; Bogic 2010), and on Performance Studies, following Richard Schechner's articulation of the concept of performance (Schechner 2013). I apply these models to the specific context of the theatre, the specific genre of drama, and the process of translating one play. This interdisciplinary exploratory study argues for the relevance of Schechner's analytical model, and more broadly of Performance Studies, to the analysis of interlingual translation processes.

TI Translation strategies in Katherine Philips's Pompey
SO PERSPECTIVES-STUDIES IN TRANSLATOLOGY
AB When Katherine Philips produced her translation of Pompey, she was unaware that she set in motion a trend for classical translations in Irish theatre. As J.-P. Short stresses, her translation was 'the first real translation of the Restoration and it was put on for the first time in 1663 in the newly-opened Smock-Alley Theatre in Dublin'. This article will examine Katherine Philips's translation strategies in her play Pompey and it will examine her choice of subject for the Restoration stage. Pompey (1663) was translated by Katherine Philips in the early years of the Restoration. Veronique Desnain observes that Philips was aware of the need to offer a play which commented on the aftermath of the war and the need to achieve political stability and the wish to establish a cultured Protestant Anglo-Irish identity. Philips used translation in a competent manner to mediate the transitional events of the newly restored monarchy. Translation, as Kay Gilliland Stevenson has pointed out, performs an important function in drama in this turbulent period. 'Translation is a phenomenon particularly interesting when considering self-consciousness about periods, or transitions.'.

The broader research's basic concept, which was also the main idea of the 13th International Festival of Theater of Belo Horizonte in 2016, was resilience. The results here presented started back then when a group formed by students, musicians, professional actors, and a professor of Greek language and literature staged a collective translation of Medea as part of the activities of the II Congress of the Brazilian Society of Rhetoric (2012). The play was enacted outdoors, in the Mangabeiras Park, for a heterogeneous audience ranging from children to elderly adults.

TI Style shift in translation: The case of translating Susan Glaspell's
   Trifles into Arabic
SO TRANSLATION & INTERPRETING-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSLATION AND
   INTERPRETING
AB This study examines style shifting in an Arabic translation of Susan Glaspell's play, Trifles by Abbas Brashi. It presents an overview of the play, as well as its importance and relevance to Arab culture. It describes the different varieties of Arabic that exist as well as the one chosen for the translation, namely Modern Standard Arabic. The paper explains that the formal style of the target language text was chosen for the sake of wide readability and comprehensibility, as dialectal varieties of Arabic differ across and within Arab states and there is no standardised script. The other reason for the shift is to adhere to the norms of acceptable Arabic writing. The style shift observed in the translation of Trifles into Arabic is demonstrated in the translation of a number of linguistic phenomena, namely contraction, elision, subject-verb agreement, and figurative multi-word expressions. The paper concludes that the formal Arabic version of Trifles may later be shifted to different informal dialectal varieties of Arabic when it is to be performed on stage. Therefore, the formal Arabic version of the play may be customised or adapted to one or more specific dialects of Arabic according to the time and place of each performance.

TI Translation of interjections in drama
SO BABEL-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE LA TRADUCTION-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF

AB This article aims to examine the most frequent strategies used in translation of interjections in Persian translated versions of English dramas. The corpus consists of the odd acts of three English drama texts and the data consists of original English interjections which are compared with their Persian translational equivalents in terms of translation strategies. Interjections are analyzed in four categories as primary interjections, secondary interjections, primary + secondary interjections and primary interjections + affirmation/negation.
   This article will explore the distribution and frequency of occurrence of each translation strategy in each hierarchy in order to determine the dominant strategies applied by Iranian translators while rendering English dramas to Persian. The results are expected to be used pedagogically and also to help those involved in dramatic industry and/or planning to take a career in this business in Iran. It's further expected that the findings contribute to the practice of drama translation in Iran.

Productions are considered in light of the consolidation of national and cultural identity implicitly pursued by the Centro Dramatico Galego, and linked to the ideological value attached to Irish cultural products in the Galician context since the early twentieth century. Through an analysis of textual and paratextual materials, informed by first-hand interviews with key agents, I will compare the different incorporation and framing strategies of J.M. Synge's and Oscar Wilde's plays to reveal the extent of the target-culture bias that characterizes their mediation processes. Those productions will illustrate the divergent norms that operate in publication and stage activity, and exemplify the powerful influence of the Centro Dramatico Galego in the Galician theatre system.

TI Exile Drama: The Translation of Ernst Toller's Pastor Hall (1939)
SO TRANSLATION AND LITERATURE
AB Ernst Toller's Pastor Hall, one of the first plays to depict life in a concentration camp, counts among the few anti-Nazi dramas translated into English before World War Two. The process by which it came to the British stage reveals the impact of censorship on authors and translators of anti-Fascist plays. It also reveals conflicting aesthetic strategies to tackle fascism. While Toller relied on straightforward documentary realism, one of his translators, W. H. Auden, championed anti-illusionism and distrusted propaganda art. In the cultural fight to reclaim Germany's heritage from the Nazis, German writers in exile viewed translations as urgent messages demanding prompt action, whereas British writers tended to see them as an archive for future generations.

TI Mask and face Im/politeness in stage translations of Mourning Becomes
   Electra
SO TRANSLATION AND TRANSLANGUAGING IN MULTILINGUAL CONTEXTS
AB Im/politeness scholars have highlighted the significance of ideology in the use of im/politeness phenomena, as the very notion of im/politeness presupposes a mental filtering of discourse through preconceptions that already exist in the mind (Terkourafi 1999, 2001, 2005; Mills 2003; Culpeper 2011; Kadar and Haugh 2013). The study aims at demonstrating how im/politeness can be manifested in two Greek versions of a dramatic dialogue that has its roots in the ancient theatre, where masks may be thought to undertake functions of face/identity formation in (im)politeness theory. The focus is on Eugene O'Neil's dramatic trilogy Mourning Becomes Electra (1931) and on two Greek stage translations of the play that are twenty-one years apart (1986 and 2007). The study adopts both a second/first order (Grainger 2011, or etic/emic) approach to the data, to gain further insight into how im/politeness plays out in the target versions and also considers in/appropriateness of social behaviour (Locher and Watts 2008) to further understanding of aspects of the relational work enacted by the protagonist. The analysis accentuates the significance of the narrative or the point of view of the target versions of the play. Findings highlight the use of different im/politeness strategies in the translated interaction between the siblings, Orin and Lavinia, which affect respondents' appropriateness judgements. Respondents appreciated a higher tension between intimacy and aggression as manifested in one of the two translations. The study underscores the value of translation data in im/politeness research by drawing attention to intra-cultural variation with regards to the use of im/politeness manifesting a different narrative/point of view (e.g. non/religious, non/allusive to the ancient theatre). Conversely, im/politeness research contributes to translation practice by showing that im/politeness options may exert influence on audience response.

TI Introducing corpus stylistics of drama in drama translation studies -
   (Im) politeness in two Chinese versions of Miller's Death of a Salesman
SO BABEL-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE LA TRADUCTION-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF
   TRANSLATION
AB Drama translation studies used to be the most neglected area in translation studies due to its prescriptive approaches and reductionist illusion of polarization of performability and readability. Corpus stylistics of drama, with the aid of computer technology as well as the understanding of the true nature of drama as the dialectical combination of both literary and theatrical characteristics, appears to be a remarkable theoretical framework and methodology for drama translation studies. The study of (im) politeness in Death of a Salesman and its two Chinese versions is undertaken as a case study. ICTCLAS and Concordance 3.0 were used to calculate the high frequent expressions concerning (im) politeness in both the original text and the Chinese versions, followed by the analysis of their stylistic function. It is found that modal particles and slang expressions in Chinese are useful to reconstruct the characterization, plot as well as performability of the translated drama. In conclusion, corpus stylistics of drama is of high feasibility in drama translation studies.

TI Culture in text and performance: The translation and dramaturgy of
   Osvaldo Dragun's Tres historias para ser contadas
SO TRANSLATION STUDIES
AB This essay examines the challenges that theatre translators and dramaturgs face while rendering the culture of the source text onto the stage of the target culture, and identifies in their collaboration a productive solution to the long-standing split between text and mise en scene. Using the author's experience as translator and dramaturg of Osvaldo Dragun's play Tres historias para ser contadas, the paper highlights how both professions come to terms with the specificities and limitations of the theatrical medium and apply strategies to optimize translatability and comprehensibility. The analysis of the narrative frames and foreignizing techniques in Dragun's text, and of its staging, suggests we may consider translation and performance as cultures unto themselves, spaces of in-betweenness where cultural traits are negotiated, dislocated and mediated to amplify the global appeal of the story. This intercultural and interdisciplinary approach is used to suggest new critical translational and dramaturgical paradigms.

TI The changing world of Afrikaans drama translations and adaptations: A
   few remarks
SO TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE
AB This article highlights a few aspects within the Afrikaans theatre tradition of drama translations and adaptations. A short historical overview is attempted from the early beginnings of Afrikaans drama and theatre up to the present day - an in-depth discussion not being feasible within the confines of a short article.
   Three periods are foregrounded, namely (1) the important role played by drama translations during the period of establishing a European theatre in South Africa; (2) the clear link between Afrikaans drama translations and adaptations, and the development of the Afrikaans language (from its official acknowledgement in 1925, the decades following that important milestone, including the heyday flourishing of Afrikaner nationalism during the 1950s to the end of the 198019, (3) as well as the period after 1994 when we find a change from more conventional translations to a greater use of adaptations and reworkings/recreations of plays within a new socio-cultural context.
   In my discussion of the first period I refer to the pioneering work done by F.C.L. Bosnian in his comprehensive studies of the early days of South African drama and theatre (Drama en Toneel in Suid-Afrika Deel 1: 1652-1855; and Deel 2: 1856-1912). It is clear from his research that the first drama and theatre practitioners had to rely quite heavily on translations of plays to be able to produce theatre productions for the newly established Cape audience. The use of translated works was, however, a general practice during this period in Europe and most people made use of translations from other languages to supplement their own corpus of plays.
   A number of well-known translated plays during this period, as well as translators (such as Mrs A.E. Carinus-Holzhausen) are mentioned, while a cursory indication is given of how drama translations were seen and discussed by both practitioners and theatre reviewers.
   In the second section, the importance of the development and establishment of the Afrikaans language and the link with Afrikaans drama and theatre are foregrounded. During this period (the heyday of Afrikaner nationalism) concerted efforts were made to develop the Afrikaans drama and theatre corpus by means of translations from the world drama and theatre traditions (as for example, reflected in the number of published translations during this period).
   In the period after 1994 fundamental changes occurred within the South African (and Afrikaans) theatre landscape. The disappearance of the old arts councils (PACT PACOPS, CAPAB, NAPAC) in South Africa and the establishment of arts festivals (inter alia KKNK, AARDKLOP, TOYOTA US WOORDFEES, VRYSTAATFEES) impacted greatly on Afrikaans theatre (and its practitioners), but it is noticeable that the use of drama translations more often drama and theatre adaptations - are still in high demand.
   In the ensuing discussion various well-known examples of drama translations and translators are given, mention is made of the fact that it is often translated plays which are performed at auspicious events (such as the inauguration of theatres even the Pretoria State Theatre in 1981) and that without these plays many theatre practitioners would have been without work and many theatres would have been empty. The situation is, however, not unique to the South African theatre tradition, but it is a practice found all over the world and Afrikaans plays are, in fact, also translated into other languages as well as performed in other countries.
   In each period I also give an indication of how practitioners in the period under discussion approached drama translations or adaptations. Theoretical insights from contemporary theorists in the ,field of drama translation (inter alia Aaltonen, Mueller-Vollmer and Pavis) are inserted in these discussions to demonstrate how each period individually contributed to the praxis of drama and theatre translation in Afrikaans.

TI What can the translation of key terms reveal about understandings of
   drama education in China?
SO APPLIED THEATRE RESEARCH
AB Based on the authors' previous academic exchange and observations, translation of terms related to drama and theatre from English to Chinese and vice versa is likely to cause misunderstandings. This research investigated what the translation of key terms may reveal about the understandings of drama education in China. Through a desk research, we collected key terms primarily related to drama and theatre from 26 seminal English and Norwegian books in the field of drama education and their Chinese translations, sorting out and comparing the English/Norwegian originals and the Chinese translations of each term. Findings confirmed that the same Chinese expressions had been used for completely different drama-related terms, while applied theatre-related terms may be misleading as the translation may refer to theatre architectures. Elaborating on the understanding of drama and theatre in China and the new drama praxis, the Drama Etudes, this study discusses what the term `drama education' may refer to in the Chinese context. The overall aim of this study is to contribute to an extended understanding of drama education and its relevant praxis in a global context.

TI Drama language translation
SO PERSPECTIVES-STUDIES IN TRANSLATOLOGY
AB Limited scholarly attention has been paid to drama translation mainly because of the duality of the dramatic text: both a literary art and a theatrical art. Dramatic text is the foundation of the stage performance, through which its value can be completely achieved. Its particularity lies in its purposes primarily for stage, and then for page. On the basis of functional equivalence proposed by Eugene A. Nida, Jin Di proposes his equivalent effect in translation. Guided by his principle and with an analysis of the two English versions of Teahouse, this thesis attempts to discover better ways to realize the equivalent effect of drama language and achieve the theatrical effectiveness of the text in the target theatrical convention so as to be accepted by the target-language audience.

TI Oskar en die pienk tannie: The journey of improbable pair from a French
   to an Afrikaans stage
SO TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE
AB Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt, the playwright of Oskar cn die pienk tannic, is one of France's most popular and laurelled authors. He has been awarded the Grand prix du theatre de I' Academic francaise and the Moliere on several occasions, notably in 2003, when French actress Danielle Darrieux won it at age 86 for the one-woman production of Oscar et la dame rose. His novels and plays have been translated into at least 46 languages and the plays have been staged in more than 50 countries, including South Africa since 2012, when the Afrikaans production of Oskar en die pienk tannie had its premiere at the Vryfees in Bloemfontein. The play is an adaptation by the playwright of his eponymous novella, which is part of a cycle of eight tales relating to religion, philosophy and diverse cultures, entitled Le cycle de I'invisiblc. The novella (2002) was not only adapted as a play (2003), but also as a film (2010) directed by the author.
   Oscar et la dame rose has a Christian theme: Oscar, a boy dying of cancer, meets Mamie Rose, one of the volunteers at a children's hospital, who advises him to write letters to God about the twelve days he has left to live. Both the novella and drama are in epistolary formal and consist of fourteen letters. The text is valued for its therapeutic effect, as it provides solace to readers and theatre-goers who have to accept the inevitable. Copies of the text, in several languages, are available in European children's hospitals. In 2003 Schmitt was awarded the Prix Jean Bernard for Oscar et la dame rose by the French Academie de Medecine.
   Although Oskar en die pienk tannie was one of the most successful translated plays performed in Afrikaans on South African stages in recent years, the fact that Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt was unknown in South Africa proved to be quite a challenge to amuse the interest of Afrikaans publishers, directors and producers for both the novella and the theatrical adaptation thereof. The Afrikaans translation of the novella and play were submitted in 2012 to a South African publisher (Human & Rousseau) and a private theatre company (Sandra Prinsloo Produksies). In France, the novella preceded the stage adaptation, but in South Africa it was the stage production of 2012, notably the performance of Sandra Prinsloo, which eventually resulted in the publication of the novella the following year (2013). As very few Afrikaans plays and even fewer plays translated into Afrikaans are ever published, the only available version of the theatrical translation is the 2012 adapted stage text which was submitted to Dalro and the Afrikaans Contemporary Drama Archive or AKDA. The unabridged Afrikaans translation of the drama text is the property of Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt production agency.
   This article documents the challenges facing translators in the language pair French Afrikaans, using the publication of the Afrikaans translation of the novella Oskar en die pienk tannie and its stage production by Lara Bye as a case-study. The author of the article translated both the novella and the stage text. Using Sirkku Aaltonen's Time-sharing on stage (2000) as a framework, the reasons for domesticating the translation and the various contexts and circumstances which resulted in different Afrikaans versions of the original French source text are outlined. As far as the stage text is concerned, examples include its adaptation to art festival format by Sandra Prinsloo and Lara Bye and the addition of English words to the Afrikaans text to enhance the contemporary authenticity of the dialogue. Domestication was unavoidable to facilitate pronunciation of the characters' nicknames, linked to their illness, as well as the non: de guerre of the female wrestlers invented by Mamie Rose to amuse Oscar and to build up his courage. By comparison to Adriana Hunter's English translation of the title (Oscar and the lady in pink), the register of the source text title was made less formal by replacing the literal Afrikaans translation of dame by tannie (or auntie).
   As a contribution to the Afrikaans stage archive, the article includes a comparison of the original French and Afrikaans productions. The first French production was directed by Christophe Lidon, whose set resembled a pop-up children's book. Both Lidon and Bye had to resolve the challenge of an ongoing dialogue between two characters with only one actor on stage. In the Lidon production, Oscar's presence is represented by an old-fashioned hospital bed centre stage with the diaphanous curtains drawn. The letters to God are "posted" in the patient's chart-holder at the foot-end of the bed. The toy chest next to the bed contains a variety of soft toys which also double up as Oscars sick friends in hospital. The Lara Bye production with Sandra Prinsloo as both Oskar and the Pienk Tannie had only one stage property, a table which was designed especially for Prinsloo and facilitated her continuous metamorphoses between the two characters. The height was calculated to allow Prinsloo to swing her legs in child-like fashion and to draw attention to her red tennis shoes, one of the markers for the Pienk Tannie role-change to Oskar. Both productions had a very effective lighting plan: in the French production, the light changed from deep blue to a mysterious white as Oscar freed himself from earthly preoccupations. In the South African version, a blue rectangle of light represented Oskar island of safety in the hospital room.
   The Lara Bye drama production ultimately won awards for Best Actress, Director and Production at the most prominent Afrikaans arts festivals, while the Afrikaans translation was also awarded several awards, including the South African Translators' Institute Prize for Excellence in the Translation of Children's Literature.

TI Translating Sicily for the German and French stage: Modern Europe, its
   periphery, and the archaic in Luigi Pirandello's Questa sera si recita a
   soggetto (1929-1935)
SO FORUM ITALICUM
AB In the last two decades, the task of the translator for the theater has been frequently discussed and translation has been recognized as an important element in the process of play production. In light of these developments, and keeping in mind that a translation, as a "politically and ideologically charged creative process of rewriting" (Krebs and Minier, 2009: 66), is always shaped by constrictions that go beyond linguistic and semantic criteria, this article examines and compares the Italian, German, and French dramatic texts of Luigi Pirandello's Questa sera si recita a soggetto and their relation to first productions in Germany and France, within the time frame of 1929-1935. The aim is to investigate strategies for drama translation in the context of the late 1920s to early 1930s ideology and to examine how translators' choices affected the representations of regional and national transnational identities. The analysis sheds light on drama translation as well as on the role of the translator in the process of play productions; in addition, it questions the porous boundaries between translations and adaptations, as well as the hierarchy according to which scholars have often read the "original" in relation to subsequent versions.

TI Translating Hungarian Drama for the British and the American Stage
SO HUNGARIAN CULTURAL STUDIES
AB Reflecting on my experience of translating contemporary Hungarian theater into English, this paper examines the fluidity of dramatic texts in their original and in translation, and charts collaborations between playwrights, translators and theater-makers. Mindful of the responsibility when working from a "minor" to a "major" language, the paper signals the discrepancy between the indigenous and foreign 'recognition circuit' and observes that translations from lesser-known languages are predominantly marked by a supply-driven agenda. Through case studies from the work of Transylvanian-Hungarian playwright Andras Visky, the paper argues that considerations regarding such key tenets of live theater as "speakability" and "performability" have to be addressed in parallel with correspondences in meaning, rhythm and spirit. The paper also points out that register and the status of certain lexical choices differ in various languages. Nuancing the trajectory of Visky's plays in English translation, this paper makes a case for translations created with and for their originals, in full knowledge of the source and receiving cultures, and with a view to their potential in performance. The paper posits the need for multiple options encoded in the translation journey, including hypothetical concepts for future mise-en-scene, and situates the translator as a key participant in the performance making process.

TI Translocating Humour to Seventeenth-Century England: The Comic Afterlife
   of Spanish Drama
SO FORUM FOR MODERN LANGUAGE STUDIES
AB The term 'Golden Age' broadly describes a period (the mid-sixteenth to late-seventeenth centuries) of great literary flowering in Spain, above all in theatre, where honour, love and humour emerged as recurring motifs. Unsurprisingly, Caroline and even more so Restoration England took an interest in the genre and imported several Spanish comedias, which made a modest but essential qualitative contribution to the London stage during this age. This essay centres on the purposes and limitations of humour in Spanish Golden Age drama, and on the extent to which the linguistic and semiotic aspects linked to comic performance were successfully carried over into the seventeenth-century English versions. By examining a corpus of performance-oriented plays in translation, I seek to illustrate the way in which contemporary British translators rendered comicality, studying how it was maintained, modified or distorted in the process, and taking into account the particular landscape proper to drama-translation practice and its degree of acceptance in the recipient culture. The dramatic areas in which comic devices function - plot, character, thought, diction, music and spectacle - are given special attention. The results reveal how practitioners may have obliterated the so-called Spanish flavour of the original comedy in an attempt to seek deliberately audience-friendly solutions, so as to fall in line with the expectations of the target theatrical context.

TI MARIA VELLUTI?S THEATER TRANSLATIONS IN NINETEENTH-CENTURY BRAZIL: A
   MISE-EN-SC?NE
SO CADERNOS DE TRADUCAO
AB Maria Velluti (1827-1891) was a dancer, actor, director, translator and playwright. She arrived in Brazil in her twenties and became a renowned actor, playwright, and translator. She translated over forty plays, many of which she directed, produced, cast, and starred. Two of her translations from French were published in her lifetime: A vida de uma actriz (1859) and A viuva das camelias (1859). Based on her prolific output, it could be said that Velluti shook the foundations of Brazil's nineteenth-century theater scene not only by introducing modern dramas of French realist tradition to the major theater companies of her time, but also by writing in an environment where most playwrights were men with a sound background in literature. This study highlights the significance of Velluti's life and works. It is a mise-en-scene of Velluti as a nineteenth-century woman, actor, playwright, and translator in her own right. It "places on the stage" the myriad of roles Velluti played, thus countering dominant historiographical discourses that describe her in a merely supporting role -a role she unmistakably did not set out to play.

   the Chichester Festival
SO MODERN DRAMA
AB The steady stream of adaptations of foreign plays for the British stage in recent decades has grown to include those of Germany's greatest classical dramatist, Friedrich Schiller, whose plays have been adapted by the British stage writer Mike Poulton. This article considers Poulton's adaptation of Schiller's Wallenstein, his largest-scale and arguably greatest work for the theatre, against the background of earlier attempts to create a one-part version for the stage. It undertakes a close comparison of the original with the modern English version, showing that Poulton has skilfully simplified, compressed, or transposed elements and sharpened aspects of the play to compensate for the British audience's lack of familiarity with the Thirty Years War. It analyses structure and characterization, language, gesture, and the staging of the Chichester Festival production of the adaptation (2009).

TI Author's Epithet in A. Casona's Dramas: Features of Functioning and
   Problem of Translation
SO NAUCHNYI DIALOG
AB The article is devoted to art techniques most typical to A. Casona's idiostyle - the author's epithet - in the aspect of translation into Russian. The term " author's epithet" means an unexpected, non-reproducible combination enriching the writer's native language. The relevance of the study is due to the fact that it is difficult to find an equivalent for the author's epithet in translation due to language asymmetry, mismatch of lexical compatibility of direct equivalents. The article provides an overview of studies on the translation of drama, as well as the extralinguistic factors that impose restrictions on the translator. The author analyzes her own translations of two plays belonging to different periods of the playwright's work. Methods of contextual, component, discursive and stylistic analysis, method of observation, generalization and description are used in the work. The study suggests that the high frequency of use, structural diversity, the ability to express the functions of various means of artistic expression (metaphor, metonymy, impersonation, antithesis, etc.) make epithet one of the most productive artistic techniques in Casona's drama. The functional approach to its translation is substantiated. The scientific novelty of the article is associated with a small study of Casona's creativity both by domestic and foreign researchers.

TI Simple and complex cognitive modelling in oblique translation strategies
   in a corpus of English-Spanish drama film titles
SO TARGET-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSLATION STUDIES
AB This article provides a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the translation of English drama film titles into Peninsular Spanish, drawing on cognitive modelling and following preliminary findings in Pena-Cervel (2016). Our study is consistent with the epistemological and ontological grounding of Cognitive Linguistics (Samaniego-Fernandez 2007) and contributes to satisfying one of the major challenges Rojo-Lopez and Ibarretxe-Antunano (2013a, 10) identify for present-day Translation Studies: To reveal the conceptual substratum that guides the translation process. Our approach does not rely on an exhaustive classification of clear-cut and well-defined translation techniques, but rather on a broad distinction between direct and oblique strategies. We demonstrate how the notion of cognitive operation, as proposed by Ruiz de Mendoza-Ibanez and Galera-Masegosa (2014), can help elucidate the sometimes seemingly arbitrary relationship between original English titles and their counterparts in Spanish, especially in cases of traditionally so-called free translations. Stands-for relations, such as expansion and reduction, are shown to play a fundamental role in the translation process and the fruitful combination of cognitive operations into conceptual complexes is explored. Our study attempts to go beyond descriptive adequacy in order to achieve explanatory adequacy.

TI Travelling Ideas of (the British) Empire: Translating the Caribbean

SO PUBLICATIONS OF THE ENGLISH GOETHE SOCIETY
AB This essay discusses Cumberland's 1771 play The West Indian and two of its German translations, by Bode (1772) and Kotzebue (1815). Existing research on the relationship between foreign colonial settings and German national fantasies helps demonstrate that bringing the Caribbean world onto the German stage had multiple effects that include but are not limited to cultivating the national imagination. Translating the global shaped the local settings, the self-understanding, and self-image of the German cities where the play was published or to be performed. Translation intersected with and fostered the development of particular local and sentimental communities. In turn, Kotzebue's play in particular can help to understand the national and global effects of popular aesthetic paradigms that emerged around 1800.

TI THE LOWER DEPTHS ON THE GERMAN STAGE
SO STUDIA LITTERARUM
AB This article examines the stage history of M. Gorky's play The Lower Depths in Germany. The author discusses German stage history of Gorky's work against the social background and in the context of major artistic tendencies of the 20th century. Steady interest in Gorky as a playwright in Germany is due to the acute social importance and universality of the problems reflected in his dramas. Bearing on the archive materials of the Gorky Museum, the essay explores interpretations of Gorky's cult drama The Lower Depths in the work of European stage directors, acclaimed reformers of theatrical art. A significant part of the "Gorky and German Theater" section of the Gorky Museum (IWL RAS) is devoted to The Lower Depths. Two series of photographs represent the first German staging of Nachtasyl (German translation of The Lower Depths). The performance of Max Reinhardt and Richard Vallentin in Berlin Kleines Theater on January 10-23,1903, had great success and good takings. After the premiere, attention to the personality of Gorky in Europe increased; he became the most popular Soviet author. When Nazi came to power, they banned Gorky's work in Germany: he reappeared on the German stage only after the World War II. In the late 1960s, on the wave of Gorky's centenary (1968), world theatres ran a series of performances based on his plays. The 1970s were marked by a renewal of interest to Gorky the playwright. The Lower Depths was staged in Europe, the USA, and the UK. Both directors and critics perceived Gorky's dramaturgy in the context of works of his contemporaries - Shaw, Ibsen, Hauptmann, Tolstoy, Chekhov.

SO TRANSLATION STUDIES
AB In dialogue with the social turn in translation studies, this article uncovers the work of invisible agents shaping the translation of performed drama in eighteenth-century England. Unlike other genres, performed drama was subject to a system of state censorship that shaped translation practices in ways that have not been fully accounted for by translation historiography. Using Carlo Goldoni as a case study, the article reveals the intervention of censors and actors in shaping Goldoni's translations, making visible for the first time the central role they played as 'rewriters' in English theatrical culture. In reading translation through the material conditions of eighteenth-century theatre, an argument is made for a re-evaluation of performed drama in the historiographical account of eighteenth-century translation in English.

TI Indirect translation on the London stage: Terminology and (in)visibility
SO TRANSLATION STUDIES
AB Productions of translated plays on the London stage use a variety of terms to describe the interlingual interpretive process that has taken place between the source text and the performance. Most frequently, a translated play is described as a version or adaptation, with the term translation reserved for specialized productions. The translation method most commonly adopted is to commission a source-language expert to prepare a literal translation which is then used by an English-speaking theatre practitioner to produce a playscript for performance. This article examines the incidence of such indirect translation practices, the inconsistencies of the applied terminology, and the relevance for indirect translation in its wider sense, revealing the shadows of translational behaviour even within language pairs, and demonstrating the multiplicity of agents impacting on the ultimate appearance of a text in translation.

TI SIMULATING JOBS OF THE TRANSLATION INDUSTRY: ON THE SPECIFICITY OF
   ROLE-PLAYING IN A TRANSLATION PROJECT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF
   TRANSLATION STUDENTS
SO CURRENT TRENDS IN TRANSLATION TEACHING AND LEARNING E
AB This article is a qualitative attempt of a phenomenological nature to contribute to the area of simulation-based learning as deployed in translation didactics. More specifically, the objective of this paper is to focus on translation trainees' views on the implementation of projects during which students are tasked with simulating professional translational activities specific to the translation industry. The fundamental two-fold research question posed in the study is 1) how the subjects interpret their experience with the project and 2) what the experience is like for them. Although in translation studies literature one can find a plethora of remarks and suggestions on the benefits of such teaching methods, very few studies have so far focused on how translation students, or students in general, perceive such activities and whether they find them useful for their future professional career in the translation industry. In an attempt to contribute to the discussion, the author of this paper applied the simulationist approach in the academic year 2019/20 at the Faculty of Philology of the University of Bialystok to 11 MA translation students. Upon the completion of the course, the author conducted a focus group interview with the students in order to inquire into possible advantages and disadvantages of this type of learning translation. Results have revealed that translation trainees were generally satisfied with the method. The study has expanded our knowledge about the potential of the simulation-based approach to translation pedagogy as seen from the student's perspective, as well as going some way towards enhancing our understanding of the image and specificity of the translation jobs the trainees hold at the very beginning stage of their learning process.

TI Translating culture in West African drama
SO JOURNAL OF AFRICAN CULTURAL STUDIES
AB West African drama helps to redefine the concept of cultural translation as it has been understood in translation studies via postcolonial and feminist theories. In looking at the tradition of Ghanaian and Nigerian anglophone playwrights we come to a richer understanding of the concept as it has been theorized in plays by both early playwrights like Joe DeGraft and Wole Soyinka and later playwrights like Jacob Yirenkyi and Tess Osonye Onwueme, who continue the tradition. Not only do the West African texts show the value of translation and the translator to the cultures represented, but they also demonstrate the function of intra-cultural translation as a method to highlight and critique power differentials based on gender and class within their cultures. Ultimately, while West African drama theorizes cultural translation to comment upon local cultures, it can also help to reshape global discourses within translation studies to enrich the debates that define the field while adding to our knowledge of the innovation and complexity of the West African literary tradition.

TI IN THE WAKE OF THE NEW DRAMA: VILLIERS DE L'ISLE-ADAM'S LA REVOLTE AND
   ITS FIRST RUSSIAN TRANSLATION
SO STUDIA LITTERARUM
AB The article deals with the special case of the Russian reception of Villiers de l'IsleAdam's work, namely with the publication of the Russian translation of the writer's early drama La Revolte ("MRTEX" [Revolt], Severny Vestnik 1897, no 10). Albeit conceived as a social drama, the play is actually a philosophical and poetic work. The conflict is based on the opposition between a conceited bourgeois Felix and his wife whose monologues express the author's own idealism. Anti-positivist and feminist ideas of the play corresponded with the views of the magazine's editors A. Volynsky and L. Gurevich. A document discovered in the archive reveals that the translator in question was S.A. Mochan, author of several publications related to the theme of female emancipation. Distinctive features of the play include the "poetics of repetition" (Jolly) that contributes to the creation of the internal integrity of the drama as well as the emphasis on the internal rather than external action. Tracing the author's use of the key words (realite, reve, sens commun, etc.) and their translation into Russian, I argue that the drama has a circular structure and that the heroine's defeat is confirmed by the fact that she adopts her spouse's way of speech. The Russian translation had substitutions and omissions that leveled some of the author's devices and smoothed the originality of the characters. At the same time, the rhetorical devices used by the translator made it possible to preserve the inner action based on the change of the emotional condition of the characters. An analysis of the language of the original drama and its translation demonstrates that close attention to the word is one of the characteristic features of Villiers de l'Isle-Adam's poetics.

TI A multimodal model of analysis for the translation of songs from stage
   musicals
SO META
AB Song translation has only recently become an area of interest for research purposes, with the development of studies on opera, films, folk music, cover songs, and more. Not many scholars have researched stage musicals, even though songs play a fundamental role in this type of performance, conveying meaning via verbal, audio and visual semiotic resources.
   A few studies on song translation can be identified, such as Low's (2003; 2005) Pentathlon Approach and Franzon's (2005) functional approach. These models of translation offer valuable guidelines on how to treat the lyrics, but what is missing is a systematic and multimodal model of analysis that can be applied to the song in its entirety. Kaindl (2005; 2013) takes into consideration the multimodality of songs, but only focuses on popular music and opera. Acknowledging the lack of substantial research on the interaction between modes, which is typical of stage musicals, this paper focuses on the development of a model of analysis that considers the semiotic complexity of songs. A new approach based on themes will allow for a more holistic view of the song and of its content.

AB A partial translation of the Yuan dynasty drama The Orphan of the Zhao Family by the Jesuit missionary Joseph Henri-Marie de Premare was published in Paris in 1735. As the first example of a Chinese theatrical work becoming known in Europe, the translation had a vast impact and gave rise to the composition of some European plays which, to varying degrees, were inspired by it. The present study focuses not on these adaptations, but on Premare's translation itself. In recognising its central role both in the formation of a European perception of Chinese literature and in the history of the development of Sinology, this study is an investigation of the linguistic and cultural modalities through which Premare managed to present to the European reader, at least in part, the moral tension that animates the drama, despite the objective difficulty present in every transcoding operation - especially in the earlier works - and the subjective ambition to provide an image of China that was not excessively "pagan."

TI Making the "Unstageable" Stageable: English Rewritings of Chekhov's
   First Play
SO MODERN DRAMA
AB This essay examines three adaptations for the English stage of Chekhov's "unstageable" first play. As well as reflecting something of the broader context of the translation and reception of foreign plays in the English theatre, these adaptations are very illuminating on fundamental aspects of English Chekhov tradition, in particular its largely veiled politics. Michael Frayn's Wild Honey, which highlights connexions with Chekhov's later plays and reinscribes cardinal elements of English Chekhov, exemplifies the strategy of domesticating the foreign. In sharp contrast, taking issue with a tradition that sentimentalizes and de-politicizes Chelchov, Trevor Griffiths's Piano reconceives Untitled Play as a political play that comments on contemporary Britain. Meanwhile, David Hare's Platonov, which purports to stick as closely as possible to the original text, ends up, like Wild Honey, reiterating the familiar hallmarks of English Chekhov. The choices made in all three adaptations attest to the fundamentally political nature of the translator's intervention as well as to the translator's contribution not merely to the transmission of culture but to its production.

TI A PROVABLE ITALIAN TRADUCTION FROM A SPANISH HEROIC PLAY FROM XVIIITH
   CENTURY: FROM EL CADALSO PARA SU DUENO, BY FERMIN LAVIANO, TO CIMENE
   PARDO, BY CARLO GOZZI
SO CUADERNOS DE ILUSTRACION Y ROMANTICISMO
AB In this paper, we will compare the Spanish play El cadalso para su dueno, by Manuel Fermin de Laviano, and Cimene Pardo, an Italian drama by Carlo Gozzi. First, we will point the role that each dramatist played in the translation of Italian plays to Spanish language, and vice versa. Next, we will offer the bibliographic information about the textual testimonies and premieres of each play. Then, we will contrast the characters, stage directions and plots of both plays. From the results of this comparative study, we propose that El cadalso para su dueno could be the resource used by Gozzi, and not recognised as it, for his writing of Cimene Pardo.

TI On Publication of Contemporary Russian Drama in China
SO FOREIGN LITERATURE STUDIES
AB In the cross-cultural communication and translingual practice of more than half a century, the translation and publication of contemporary Russian drama in China has its obvious characteristics of the times and phases, and shows multiple ideological dimensions, aesthetic charm and Chinese tradition. In 1960s-1970s the translation and publication of contemporary Russian drama in China manifested a strong political and ideological inclination, and "internal publications" such as the yellow book and critical pamphlet become markers of the age. The period of 1980s-1990s was characterized by the publication of drama collections and film scripts and the study of both classical drama and artistic aesthetics. The beginning of the 21th century witnessed the collaboration between selection of dramas and scholarly journals, and the coexistence of old and new dramas. Contemporary Russian drama translation and publication in China Shave been closely related to many factors, such as contemporary Chinese social situation, Sino-Russian cultural relationship, cultural tradition and mainstream consciousness of the time. In short, the publication of contemporary Russian drama in China has generally shifted from the emphasis on mainstream consciousness and discipline to the individual poetic construction. Meanwhile, it shows difficult transformation from national collective consciousness to personal consumerism consciousness at the turn of 20th-21st centuries.

TI Bashir Lazhar on paper and stage or retranslation from a multimodal,
   intermedial perspective
SO TRANSLATOR
AB The traditional definition of retranslation as the second or later rendering of a work into one same language is necessarily transformed when seen from a perspective informed by multimodality and intermediality. While the influence of multimodality on our understanding of translation practices has been variously discussed in the literature, little has been said about the relation between multimodality, intermediality and retranslation. Accordingly, this paper has two goals. Firstly, it seeks to discuss how multimodality and intermediality may have an effect on our theoretical knowledge of retranslation. Secondly, it aims to illustrate these theoretical observations through the analysis of different textualities originating in Bashir Lazhar, a one-character play by Quebecois playwright Evelyne de la Cheneliere. Of particular interest to build the present case study are the French and Spanish versions of the dramatic text as well as a specific stage performance delivered by French-Mexican actor and translator Boris Schoemann in Mexico City in 2012. The study will show how various semiotic codes interact through intermodal, intermedial retranslation practices in order to create new meanings in the performance text.

It starts by offering an overview of clandestine translation under Franco's regime, it considers the social impact of later reeditions and analyzes the translation criteria employed in his translations of Shakespeare's plays: Sagarra's is a natural fictive orality meant not to be read aloud but rather to be staged, and his use of formal resources like rhythm and rhyme distinguish him from his predecessors (Magi Morera i Galicia and Cesar August Jordana) and followers (Maria Manent). Finally, the article analyzes the reception that Sagarra's translations have had.

TI A 'GREAT ANTI-WAR PLAY': BURY THE DEAD ON THE WORLD STAGE
SO AUSTRALASIAN DRAMA STUDIES
AB With its compelling story of dead soldiers refusing to be buried as a protest against war, Irwin Shaw's 1936 experimental play Bury the Dead met with instant success on the New York stage. While it was eagerly taken up by mainstream and little theatres in the USA, it has most often been staged by radical and left-wing theatres throughout the world, including in Australia, Great Britain, India, South Africa and Canada. It resonated with audiences, and it also made waves: at an early British performance, members of the audience had to be treated for shock.
   Shaw drew his inspiration from the horrors of World War I and the Spanish Civil War, and the play's anti-war message and experimental style proved to be popular with Depression-era audiences fearing another world war. Its relevance has not diminished since that era, its success as a tool for moral protest and social commentary continuing to the present day, in many translations and nations. Its production, too, has been in varying forms. This article investigates the continuing attractiveness of Bury the Dead as an anti-war drama across a variety of historical, cultural, political and production contexts from 1936 to 2018, and interrogates the play's relevance for theatres in disparate times and places. In focusing on the play's Australian productions, it also provides a comprehensive production history of the work in this country.

TI TRANSLATION OF THE KEYWORDS: HAUPTMAN'S DRAMA THE HOLIDAY OF
   RECONCILIATION AND ITS RUSSIAN VERSION
SO STUDIA LITTERARUM
AB The problem of understanding original foreign text connected with its translation and interpretation implies a double process - the juxtaposition of the author's original and its translated version. Hauptman's early drama The Holiday of Reconciliation is an interesting case in this respect. The German playwright's fundamental idea, e.g. the development of the ethical response to life in general and to the individual existence in particular in the soul of the person originates in this drama. Inaccuracies in the Russian translation lead us to the wrong understanding of the deep meaning of Hauptman's drama. While comparing both texts, the Russian one and the original one, it becomes clear that the translation lacks connotations that in the original text serve as a poetic key to clarify the authors intention. The valuable meaning of the noun "das Gemut" ("inner warmth," "spiritual life," "generosity, high virtue") is lost in the Russian equivalent. The wrong translation obscures the central idea of the drama that allforgiveness is the supreme blessing. The Russian translation of the word "die Fugung" as "fate, destiny" does not convey a feeling of the global inner unity. In the original text, the etymological scale of the die Fugung is much wider: it means connection of everything with everyone. The contrasting pairs of words, such as "in uns" (the Stolz family) and "in ihr" (Ida) that are not preserved in the Russian version, underline the kindness of Wilhelm's bride that Hauptman sees as the source of the Light of Truth.

TI Sunset Boulevard in Spanish Performance: Translations on the Musical

AB This article focuses on Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Sunset Boulevard (1993), in order to present some relevant aspects of the production and reception of musicals both in an original and a target context. The study will first describe the eventful creative process of this musical text in its Anglophone source contexts, and will then move on to examine it from the perspective of its performance in Spanish translation. Recently translated for a Spanishlanguage production staged in Tenerife in 2017 (soon followed by another one in Argentina in 2018), Sunset Boulevard is a good example of the powerful impact that the importation of Anglo-American musicals has had in Spain in recent decades (see Mateo 2008) while it also serves to illustrate interesting aspects of the evolution and current situation of musicals' production in this country. This macro-level study will therefore examine Lloyd Webber's musical performed in sung translation, addressing it from a contextual standpoint and with a focus in Spain, with the aim of contributing to a deeper knowledge of theatre translation when it involves musical plays.

TI CAT AND THE PLUMBER: AN AMERICAN RADIO DRAMA IN CHINA
SO COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES
AB The translation and adaptation of Arthur Miller's 1941 radio drama "The Pussy Cat and the Expert Plumber who was a Man" in 1980s China not only conveys the witty humor and intriguing critique of the original, but also carries unique marks of its receiving culture. A comparative close reading of the original and the translation shows how the original survives in a translation. Instead of antagonizing the east and the west as mutually unintelligible, my analysis of the translated Chinese radio drama "Cat and the Plumber" explores ways in which interlingual, intermedia, and intertextual references and variations help build the "image" of the west in post-Mao China through sound media. The literary event of a 1940s American radio drama traveling to 1980s China not only provides us with a new perspective in looking at the social soundscape as well as popular culture of 1980s China but also contributes to the repertoire of Sino-American cultural exchanges during the last decade of the Cold War. At the dawn of a new era in the history of China, the introduction of this American radio drama shows both achievements as well as limitations of the early post-Mao cultural reforms.

TI Translating discourse markers in theater David Mence's Convincing Ground
   in Italian translation
SO TRANSLATION AND INTERPRETING STUDIES
AB This article examines the translation of discourse markers in drama dialogue. Discourse markers are an important feature of spoken language, and unsurprisingly, they abound in drama dialogue. Yet very few studies have addressed the issue of discourse markers in theater translation. While some scholars suggest that discourse markers do not add anything to the propositional content of the sentence (Bazzanella 1994), our study reveals that it is very difficult to omit them in translation. In this article we suggest that an approach based on pragmatics could inform the practice of translating discourse markers in a playtext without overriding the importance of the rhythm of a spoken utterance, which is vital for rendering a play in translation (Bartlett 1996).

TI Audience participation digital drama-based learning activities for
   situational learning in the classroom
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
AB In this study, the transformational play approach was further used to deploy drama-based situational learning in the classroom through the Digital Learning Theatre (DLT) by engaging drama performers and the audience collaboratively. This study analysed the learners' learning effectiveness based on translation and sentence-construction abilities, and their perception by focussing on concentration, and comprehension of dialogues before and after the drama-based activity. The experimental results were based on both the DLT including tablet PCs to enable audience participation in drama performances, and the DLT for drama performances in which the audience can participate through traditional open discussion sessions with the narrator of the drama. Sixty-five students were selected randomly as participants from the English as a Foreign Language academic program at the junior high school level. The application of the DLT including the tablet PCs approach showed considerable improvement in students' learning effectiveness as well as a significant positive effect on classroom learning, outperform the effectiveness of the DLT with traditional open discussion sessions for the audience. Accordingly, to improve students' learning effectiveness, their engagement in the learning process can be advanced through situational learning activities using educational technologies that combine with collaborative learning mechanisms for classroom learning. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic The transformational play proposed by Sasha Barab is designed based on situated cognition theory to position persons, content, and context together through digital games. Dorothy Heathcote proposed a drama-based learning approach for learning in the classroom, and learners can play various roles in the drama to learn in a situational learning setting. The teacher, too, plays a role to guide the students and engage them in the situational learning setting. Integration of immersive educational technologies supports learning by reducing obstacles to adoption in the learning process and improve learning effectiveness. Within a rich contextual learning environment, learners can be placed in different situational learning tasks that allow them to apply existing knowledge and experiences. What does this paper add This study introduces a manner of applying the transformational play approach in drama-based situational learning activities suitable for collaborative learning in a classroom setting. It introduces a practical and simple method to transform a regular classroom into a digital version of the learning theatre, including a virtual stage to drama performances. The drama-based situational learning approach facilitates the audience as well as the performers to transform themselves into protagonists in the learning context by collaboratively following the learning content and learning with their peers. The technology-enhanced drama-based situational learning approach is introduced based on the transformation play approach that allows the students to learn situationally through different script instances, and improves their learning effectiveness by helping them understand the learning content through performing, participating, watching, and interacting in the learning context.
   Implications for practice and/or policy Learners can apply their prior knowledge and experiences creatively through drama-based learning activities, and interactive engagement allows the audience to participate in the learning process equally as drama performers. Educators and learning system developers can implement this approach to facilitate situational practice and discuss learning content. The learning process supports the reinterpretation of the learners' experiences and reflects on how to procure/adopt new knowledge and apply it to real-life situations. Drama performance is a collaborative/group learning task and it is performed for the audience. Students with higher achievements will help students with lower achievements so that everyone can contribute in the learning process to achieve their learning objectives.

It has been translated twice into Catalan, the first time in 1984 by Josep M. Balanya, and the second in 2013 by Joan Sellent; the latter version was performed in 2013-14 around Catalonia. In this paper we first discuss the presence of concepts such as domination, power and ideology in the discourse on cultural identity, and we then analyze what treatment a group of cultural and stylistic elements related to language, education and culture have received in the two translations. It is concluded that there is a relationship between the translators' pursuit of fluency and a certain ideological message.

TI Man of the Theatre: Stage Performances of T. S. Eliot's Work in Spain
   (1949-2016)
SO NEOPHILOLOGUS
AB T. S. Eliot's presence in Spanish theatres has taken various forms. His verse drama enjoyed a relative popularity in the late 1940s and in the 1950s: Murder in the Cathedral, The Family Reunion and The Cocktail Party were staged by student and amateur groups, "chamber" companies and even a national theatre. Reviews were ambivalent, most of them finding fault with the plays' poetic density as an impediment for performance. Although, as a conservative Anglo-Catholic, Eliot was a priori an unproblematic author for the Francoist establishment and its censorship, critics loyal to Spanish National Catholicism were uncomfortable with the tragic fatalism of The Family Reunion, or with the non-judgemental treatment of adultery in The Cocktail Party. When Eliot's plays were losing their appeal from the late 1950s onwards, only Murder in the Cathedral was occasionally performed in Spain. More recently, intermedial transpositions and dramatizations of Eliot's poetry have consolidated his image as a great influential poet whose drama is a rarity.

TI "Translated" and "Constructed" Ibsen:Ibsen Metamorphosed in China
SO FOREIGN LITERATURE STUDIES
AB Since Ibsen has a wide international reputation and influence and his plays are read and performed across cultures, translation has' played an important role in making different productions of Ibsen' s plays. It is true that Ibsen has been translated in different languages and cultures, and there are actually different "Ibsens", or different versions of his plays. According to Walter Benjamin, although a translation "comes later than the original, and since the important works of world literature never find their chosen translators at the time of their origin, their translation marks their stage of continued life." Inspired by Benjamin' s thinking of translation and Damrosch' s emphasis on the role played by translation in constructing world literature, the present author lays particular emphasis on the translation of Ibsen' s plays in the Chinese context and deals with different productions of Ibsen' s plays in 21st century China. To the author, it is such translations and retranslations that endow Ibsen and his plays with a "continued" life or an "after-life", enabling him to be one of the best-known Western writers, without which he might remain "marginalized" like many of his Scandinavian peers in the Chinese cultural and literary context. And it is through such translations and retranslations, both interlingual and intercultural and even intersemiotic, that there have appeared a different Ibsen and different productions of Ibsen' s plays in China.

TI Cry to Heaven: A Play to Celebrate One Hundred Years of Chinese Spoken
   Drama by Nick Rongjun Yu
SO ASIAN THEATRE JOURNAL
AB Yutian (Cry to Heaven) is the third chinese stage adaptation of Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel Uncle Tom's Cabin between 1907 and 2007. The first, Heinu yutian lu (Black Slave's Cry to Heaven) by Zeng Xiaogu, was staged by Chinese students in Tokyo in 1907; the second, Heinu hen (Regret of the Black Slaves) by Ouyang Yuqian, was mounted as part of the fiftieth anniversary of the first production; and third, Yutian (Cry to Heaven), commemorated the hundredth anniversary of Chinese spoken drama (huaju) in 2007. Each adaptation has a different focus that reflects the social, political, and cultural conditions of its time, and together the works provide a historial view of the development of Chinese spoken drama. The most recent production, by Nick Rongjun Yu, juxtaposes one hundred years of dramatic history with scenes from Uncle Tom's Cabin, making the American slaves' struggle to gain freedom a metaphor for Chinese dramatists' efforts to achieve their own.
   Yu Rongjun, also known as Nick Rongjun Yu, is the author of more than twenty plays, including Renmo gouyang (Dog's Face), WWW.COM, and Tiantang gebi shi fengrenyuan (The Asylum Next to Heaven). His plays have won many prizes in China and have been performed in Hong Kong, Taipei, the United States, and other countries. Besides being a playwright, he is director of programming and marketing for the Shanghai Dramatic Arts Center.

AB The early nineteenth century is the focus of this case-study on the reception of Greek drama in the Low Countries. Its central question concerns the cultural distance between the original plays and their modern translators. The essay argues that the question of translating the ancient authors 'faithfully' first emerged at the time when the Greek plays were also for the first time being produced on the modern stage. Two novel research instruments were used for this contribution: a new bibliography of Dutch translations of Greek drama, and a theatrography of performances produced in the Netherlands and Flanders. Based on these data, a number of general observations can be formulated, which form the introduction to the analysis of specific early nineteenth-century adaptations of Sophocles' Antigone.

TI Revealing "beauty" in modern Chinese theatre: Max Reinhardt as an
   anti-Ibsenite emperor in Yu Shangyuan's translation
SO ASIA PACIFIC TRANSLATION AND INTERCULTURAL STUDIES
AB Traditionally, the Chinese indigenous theatre did not require a director. In 1924, Yu Shangyuan published two articles on the prominent modern theatre director Max Reinhardt, "Xianzai Niuyue de Laiyinhate" (Reinhardt in Today's New York) and "Laiyinhate de "Qiji'" (Reinhardt's The Miracle), offering Chinese readers a rare glimpse into the Western theatre directing system. Existing scholarship tends to regard the two articles as original works. The present paper argues that they were composed mainly of "unmarked translations" rendered from four foreign works. Anchored by this observation, this paper gives a detailed study of these two articles, covering the incentives for translation, the translation results, and the reasons behind the results. It unveils Yu Shangyuan's orientation of theatre director as an artist-director instead of an administrator, presents his reconstruction of Max Reinhardt's image as an "anti-Ibsenite emperor," and discloses the relevance of his textual strategies to his artistic view. It demonstrates that Yu Shangyuan, influenced by the vision of "aesthetic drama," purposely reshaped the image of Max Reinhardt so as to spread the gospel of a new conception of drama, that is, drama should purport mainly to afford the aesthetic experience, or reveal "beauty," as Yu Shangyuan termed it.

TI Allegory Plays
SO STUDIES IN ENGLISH LITERATURE 1500-1900
AB In this brief polemic, I draw upon two exemplary rhetorical treatises the pseudo-Ciceronian Rhetorica ad Herennium and Quintilian's Institutio Oratoria in order to argue that moral allegory no longer plays and it needs to. Allegory plays in both senses of the term: it plays for the stage as good drama, and it plays in the sense that its authors, producers, directors, and actors had some fun with it. Over time, both senses have been lost in translation. Both can be recovered, however, once we reintegrate a bona fide, mnemotechnically inspired rhetoric of performance into the theory and practice of allegory. The rhetorical and mnemonic conception of allegory as prototheatrical or theatrical practice allows us to recuperate the patently ludic dimensions of allegorical theater and theatrical allegory.

TI "Words are not simple play things!" : l'heterolinguisme theatral chez
   Patrick Leroux
SO LINGUISTICA ANTVERPIENSIA NEW SERIES-THEMES IN TRANSLATION STUDIES
AB This article explores how, in the 1990s, Canadian playwright Patrick Leroux broke away from previously prevalent representations of bilingualism in minority Franco-Ontarian drama and made multilingualism and translation into theatrical "play things". His most playful performance text, Le Reve totalitaire de dieu l'amibe, features as many games as issues at stake for staging experimental minority theatre. Substractive ideologies around bilingualism are torn apart, heterolingualism is raised and deconstructed like a strange tower of Babel and translation becomes BabelFish-like. L'ombre du lecteur anglais (The shadow of the English reader) and an Anglophone commentator are added to a production that is constantly reworked, retranslated and surtitled. The trajectory of the production from Ottawa to Sudbury (in Ontario) and Saint-Lambert (in Quebec), and then on to Montreal and to Hull, delineates a playground for translation riddled with layers of address to spectators, depending on their level of comprehension of the languages spoken on (and off) stage.

TI The Circumstances of Colour: The Jim Crow Translation of Jonny spielt
   auf
SO MODERN DRAMA
AB This article examines the American premiere of the German opera Jonny spielt auf as a form of what I call Jim Crow translation. As originally written and composed by Ernst Krenek, the opera centres on Jonny, a Black jazz musician, who disorders the logic of European cultural superiority. Although thoroughly modern in its original German staging, using stereophonic radios and film projectors, Krenek's appropriation of Blackness relied on blackface baritones to play Jonny. When the opera came to New York's Metropolitan Opera, the history of minstrelsy and the legal system of Jim Crow haunted the production. While Jonny was depicted as thoroughly cosmopolitan and modern in Krenek's conception of the opera, the American production, under the management of Giulio Gatti-Casazza, attempted to turn Jonny into a white vaudevillian in blackface, a publicity stunt that brought the opera further attention under the guise of protecting American morals against a narrative of interracial sexual desire. Though Krenek created an opera based on the value of Black modernity, Gatti-Casazza displayed American racial anxieties through the opera's promotion. The proposed revisions to the text, through which racialist regimes demonstrated their power over cultural production, reflect the role that translation can play in reinforcing the colour line.

TI A substitute for Phedre or the (un)translatability of intertextual
   references in Jean-Paul Daumas's Le cimetiere des elephants
SO TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE
AB The translation of intertextual references (in this case of a French source text into an Afrikaans target text) in Jean-Paul Daumass's play Le cimetiere des elephants (The Elephant Graveyard; American translation by Phyllis Zatlin) poses a particular challenge to the Afrikaans translator. None of the references have been translated into Afrikaans and a new translation would thus not be recognizable to the Afrikaans reading and theatre-going public. Daumas uses quotes from the three main genres, poetry, drama and prose, but only the first two are from authentic sources. The quoted lines of verse are taken from Paul Valery's well-known poem, Le cimetiere marin, which echoes the play's cemetery theme. While Zatlin was able to use Cecil Day-Lewis' successful English translation, the Afrikaans translator opted for a quotation from an Ingrid Jonker poem. The seminal intertextual source in the play is Jean Racine's Phedre, which is quoted three times by the main character and functions as a play within a play. Within a French context, quotations from Phedre are of course utterly recognizable, not only because it is a prescribed play for students and learners, but because it is still frequently staged. Afrikaans theatre cannot lay claim to any similarly well-known play in a classical register, especially since the 1994 transformation of the various Performing Arts Councils into playhouse management boards put an end to regular exposure to varied repertoires, including classical plays. Although certain Afrikaans alternatives, such as PG du Plessis's Siener in die suburbs, are eminently recognizable, the register does not fit the retired actress in Daumas's play, who has always excelled at aristocratic roles. A creative solution would be to replace audience recognition of the literary reference with their recognition of the actress, whose real name is used in the play instead of the stage name of the (fictitious) French actress, Ludivine Putiphar. One of the best-known actresses in South African theatre history is Sandra Prinsloo, who also commissioned the Afrikaans translation of Le cimetiere des elephants. By using her real name as a stage name, the translator is able to glean possible equivalents for Phedre from her productions in both Afrikaans and English (languages which for the most part are interchangeable to the Afrikaans theatre-goer and the choice of which is left to the future director of the play). Quotations were limited to the classical repertoire of her production list, provided they were thematically linked to Daumas's play and that there was a natural transition between the quotation and the preceding and following dialogue. After careful consideration, the translator finally took her cue from Zatlin's choice of a Shakespearian equivalent for Phedre: not Anthony and Cleopatra, as in the case of the American translation (the recognition of which owes much to the 1963 film version, Cleopatra, starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton), but Macbeth. Prinsloo played Lady Macbeth in two memorable (English) productions, and it is a well-known still photograph from the Dieter Reible production which inspired the choice of play. As the actress in the play quotes from her iconic play in full costume and matching stage make-up, the image of a dishevelled Prinsloo as Lady Macbeth (reproduced in the article) can only emphasize the transition between boarding-house repartee and the re-enactment of her past glory on stage.
   As auditory recognition has been replaced with visual recognition, the quotes may be recited in either English or Afrikaans. However, to match Daumas's unilingual source text, the translation is entirely in Afrikaans and features the Eitemal Afrikaans version of Macbeth. Creative solutions enable Afrikaans translators to continue translating foreign plays containing culture-specific intertextual references and, in this case, to pay hommage to one of the doyennes of the Afrikaans stage.

SO TRANSLATOR
AB This article interrogates the translation strategies involved when transposing Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan novels into a play - the first produced in the UK. My Brilliant Friend, adapted by April De Angelis and directed by Melly Still, was based on the translation of the novels by Ann Goldstein and first staged at the National Theatre (London) in 2019/2020 following its success at the Rose Theatre, Kingston in 2017. In investigating the 'making' of the play, particularly through a series of interviews with De Angelis, the article examines how Ferrante's works have been altered to suit the taste of its Anglophone audiences and what message the National Theatre is sending about the way in which the play and the use of non-standard languages in southern Italian drama have been translated on British stages. The article calls for stronger collaboration between the National Theatre, theatre practitioners, and translation scholars to foster greater cross-cultural understanding and help raise the general low status of translated theatre.

The paper gives the definition and enumerates features of the formula created with great success by the French dramatist Eugene Scribe. Presenting the figure of Thomas William Robertson, the father of theatre management and realism in Victorian theatre, the focus is placed on his adaptations of French plays and his incorporation of the formula of the well-made play and its conventional dramatic devices into his original, and most successful, plays, Society and Caste. The paper also examines the critical response to the well-made play in England and dramatists who use its formula, especially from the point of view of George Bernard Shaw, who famously called the French plays of Scribe and Victorien Sardou-"Sardoodledom."

TI Translatability and untranslatability of Tae-sok Oh's theater
SO PERSPECTIVES-STUDIES IN TRANSLATOLOGY
AB This paper intends to examine the translation strategy of the English translation and publication of Tae-sok Oh's plays. The translation of a less commonly used language into the hegemonic language often requires more than a transfer of the textual dimension because of the differences of cultural hegemony between the languages. Thus, attention should be paid to non-textual factors in translation, including the role of translators, the publication process, book reviews and stage performance, in order to increase the translatability of theater texts. Also, as a theater text is 'an open and moving text' by its very nature, often refusing to be fixed and confined, the textual authority of the source text is subject to challenge. However, the instability of the source text in theater can allow and encourage theater translators to become engaged in the more active deciphering and reconstructing process. A foreign cultural dimension of the text is best transferred with the help of non-verbal language on the stage. These factors will increase the general translatability of a theater text.

SO TRANSYLVANIAN REVIEW
AB The period 1830-1860 was one of the most relevant in the process of modernization of the Romanian society. In this context, the westernization of Romanian language was a major preoccupation of writers: writers like Ion Heliade Raddulescu and Constantin Negruzzi wanted to modernize Romanian language and they considered the translation of Western literature as an important instrument in spreading romance lexical borrowing. Constantin Negruzzi was one of the most active writers who were involved in the creation of a national Romanian theatre. He translated many works of Romantic european literature, especially the dramas Marie Tudor and Angelo, le tyranne de Padoue by Victor Hugo. Considering linguistic and lexical aspects, the two translations are really advanced: the language is very close to the modern Romanian and it combines traditional lexic, romance neologisms and the imitation of spoken language. This study wants to describe the principal strategies of lexical borrowing adopted by Constantin Negruzzi and to analyse the contribution of translations to increasing Romanian vocabulary.

SO STELLENBOSCH THEOLOGICAL JOURNAL
AB Various scholars have speculated about the possible link between the Fourth Gospel and drama. Such a connection, if valid, could potentially lead to the widening of hermeneutical lenses with which the Gospel is explored. While the exegetical field of biblical performance criticism has begun to break open the hermeneutical field by introducing performative and oral elements into the conversation, an attempt to formulate a methodology for a drama analysis of the text still needs to be made. This article evaluates the possibility of reading the Fourth Gospel through a drama lens in order to explore its possible performative impact on a first-time hypothetical audience. 'the article experiments with possible parameters of biblical drama criticism and how the translation of the text into stage-script format could be useful in academic and ecclesial spaces. Such a translation invites new experiences with the text and an expansion of the hermeneutical spectrum to include various non-textual elements like sound and sight. Moreover, it widens the hermeneutical scope to explore the audience's own (vulnerable) journey with the performance by taking their possible struggle(s) with the drama seriously.

Not only do they explore their bilingualism in plays that incorporate Canada's two official languages, they enhance the bilingual aesthetics of the original play with the use of surtitles. In addition to conventional surtitles translating the source text delivered orally on stage, creative surtitles transmit new messages and thus multiply the possible readings generated by the performance. Thus, translation achieves a certain autonomy within the theatre production and, in doing so, redefines its function while challenging the existing theoretical models applied to the translation of dramatic texts.

TI Printing Stage: Relationships between performance, print, and
   translation in early English editions of Moliere
SO EARLY MODERN FRENCH STUDIES
AB The publication of dramatic texts designed initially to be performed on stage requires a form of translation from one medium to another. While a play in manuscript might be subject to modification in the rehearsal stage, a printed version is intended to preserve the text in a more fixed form. Moliere became involved in the Paris printing world in order to maintain authorial and commercial control of his works. Yet the printing of his works allowed them to travel beyond the bounds of Paris and France. From the early 1660s onwards many of his plays were translated quickly in England, where there was high demand for dramatic material following the closure of the theatres during the interregnum. The translators of Moliere took on the role of seeing new versions of his work put through the printing press and by the early eighteenth century collected works of Moliere were published in translation. Far from the translators making themselves invisible, they used publication techniques to advertise their changes. In doing so they demonstrate engagement with the French sources and encourage readers to keep in mind the plays' stage histories.

The study is based on the analysis of the parallel Polish-Italian text of the drama Przed sklepem jubilera [The jeweller's shop] by Karol Wojtyla. The comparison of the original Polish text with its Italian translation made it possible to distinguish semantic nuances lost at the lexical level of the translation, while the results of the reverse operation (comparison of the target text in Italian with the source text in Polish) prove the presence of many "added" lexical elements in the final text. They are mostly multi-word combinations with varying degrees of idiomaticity, i.e. phraseological units. Traces of semantic losses as well as added elements clearly indicate a creative role of the literary translator who becomes in this way the "second author" of a text.

TI Stoic Embodiment in Marston's Antonio Plays
SO ENGLISH LITERARY RENAISSANCE
AB Stoicism presents itself in John Marston's Antonio plays in a recognizably parodic, exaggerated form: characters passionately denounce its supposed endorsement of socially isolated existence to gird themselves for proper action. Such an understanding, however, ignores both the subtle ways early modern Stoicism demanded embodiment and the complex theatricality with which Marston stages his dramas. By repeatedly calling attention to the material conditions of their performanceconditions that, according to satiric convention, promise a kind of failure of dramatic realizationthe Antonio plays invite a more nuanced understanding of the stoic ideas they appear to denounce. Marston inextricably ties theatricality to early modern Stoicism, and this theatricality can be found tacitly woven throughout influential translations of classical and Neo-Stoic texts. Stoicism entails a performative grammar that admits to a life lived in a constructed but unknowable world and Marston's self-aware, continually collapsing, and dramaturgically muddled plays are an ideal vehicle for this mode of acknowledgment.

The article, a close analysis of the nonverbal signs, explains the relevance of these semiotics and their thematic functions, and compares them with those of Fayez Iskandar's translation of the play text. The researchers assess Iskandar's translation outcomes, identify and classify the effectiveness of the translation methods, employed by Iskandar, in maintain-ing the dysfunctional sign system and the incongruous relations within the play.

TI Translation and theatre From performance to performativity
SO TARGET-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSLATION STUDIES
AB The last two decades have seen an increasing interest from different quarters in exploring the territory that exists between translation and theatre. Examining discussions of the nature of drama and theatre - that see them as performative rather than representative entities (Worthen 2003; Schechner 2002) - this article argues for a rethinking of the interdisciplinary relations between translation and theatre in the context of wider debates over the value of interdisciplinarity in translation studies (Pym 1998; Chesterman 2010; Bassnett 2012). Drawing on the contributions to this special issue, the social dimension of translation and the performative nature of culture are brought to the fore as productive new ways of studying translation in the theatre as a performative and social as well as a linguistic practice.

TI The works of A. P. Chekhov in Iraq: Receptions and Interpretations
SO PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
AB The review covers the main content of the book, which includes three semantic blocks. The first block, a historical-literary one, is devoted to the perception of the personality and creative activity of A. P. Chekhov by Iraqi criticism. The second one analyzes the performances of Chekhov's works on the stages of Iraq. The third block contains the Russian translations of the texts of the plays written by the Iraqi writer A. Naim, based on the works of Chekhov. The review highlights the range of problems analyzed by the authors of the book and the methodological aspects of comparative analysis and receptive poetics. The author of the article notes the specific features and peculiarities of the intercultural translation of the texts of Chekhov's works from one artistic language into another in the situation in which the author and the readers belong to different cultural traditions. The review focuses on the fact that the study of the Arab perception of Chekhov's personality and creative activity allows the researcher to see the Russian culture in a new light and to better understand the Arab culture. Attention is drawn to the fact that the presentation of Chekhov's plays on the Arab stage takes place in a completely different cultural-historical tradition. This tradition is based on the folk theater and religious mysteries. They determine the apperceptive background and cultural experience not only of Iraqi audience, but also of the authors acting as retranslators of Chekhov's works. The article emphasizes the significance of the appendix with the texts of five plays by Naim in Russian translation, which are remakes of Chekhov's works. The advantage of the book is the absolute novelty of the material, a new vision of the problems and a heuristic approach to them, and the semantic expansion of the content of well-known literary works.

TI The Drama in the Sentence: Sequence as a Crucial Challenge for Literary
   Translation from and to Korean
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF KOREAN STUDIES
AB In translation, carefully-crafted sentences are exposed to myriad dangers. This is because translators tend to prioritize syntactical fidelity at the expense of sequence, that is, the order of elements insofar as this relates to calculated progression, gradual disclosure of information, and cumulative development of meaning. But if sequence is turned around for the sake of fluency (conforming to the target language's ostensibly "natural" word order), the reader's experience changes as well. Through a set of examples drawn from English translations of Korean fiction, this article demonstrates that the common disregard for sequence is tantamount to a neglect of drama and suspense, of narrative perspectivation, of rhetorical sophistication and cognitive effect. But we also see that by favoring functional equivalence over imitation of grammatical dependencies, it is perfectly possible to allow the reader to process all information at a pace that is analogous to that of the original. Our findings provide insights that are of significance for other language pairings as well.

TI British Drama Studies in China during the Eleventh Five-Year-Plan Period
SO FOREIGN LITERATURE STUDIES
AB During the period of the Eleventh Five-Year-Plan Period, British drama studies in China have made great progress in the research achievements and the numbers of nation-based projects. The study of Shakespeare has been the major focus and the second half of 20th-century British drama studies have been more and more emphasized. Besides, some influential academic journals and institutions in China have provided the impetus for the research. Nevertheless, some problems also need to be solved, such as the limitation and the imbalance of studies, the repetition in the quantity of works and the lack of creative methodology. Based on this survey, in the Twelfth Five-Year-Plan Period, the following strategies may be taken to enhance British drama studies in China. We may broaden and deepen the study on more playwrights and their works in diverse perspectives, strengthen the research of different periods of British drama, increase the translation of major works, and put some emphasis on comprehensive drama study.

TI M. MAETERLINCK'S ART IN F. SOLOGUB'S RECEPTION
SO IZVESTIYA URALSKOGO FEDERALNOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA 2-GUMANITARNYE NAUKI
AB This paper deals with the history of the artistic dialogue between F. Sologub and M. Maeterlinck and singles out stages of Sologub's perception of the Belgian author's oeuvre. The article refers to writings by Maeterlinck (the original physiophilosophical essay The Life of the Bee, poems translated by Sologub, and The Blue Bird play) and by Sologub (articles and reviews, plays The Gift of Wise Bees, The Night Dances). The first step of reception included reading and translating original texts into Russian. In Sologub's personal library, there were volumes by Maeterlinck in French and in Russian; in his archives, there are unpublished translations of poems; in addition, there is a probability that Sologub participated in the translations of plays made by his wife An. Chebotarevskaya. The next stage implied references to Maeterlinck's art in journalistic works (including the article The Wisdom of Maeterlinck). In Sologub's opinion, one of the fundamental principles of Maeterlinck's art was the idea of an inseparable connection between love and death. The intertextual links between Sologub's The Gift of Wise Bees and Maeterlinck's The Life of the Bee are allusions to the images of bees, honey, and wax, which become metaphors of life, love, and art, respectively in the Russian play. The concept of "dialogue" was particularly important for Sologub's art: according to him, a genuine writer can only create within the scope of previous works of art, and his primary task is to be selective and able to "see" and use the material of their own. In this paper, the author suggests the idea that Sologub started writing plays under the influence of Maeterlinck's writings and his concept of the new theatre. Then there was a new level of artistic communication: almost simultaneously two plays were created and staged in Russia (one by Sologub and the other by Maeterlinck). The two plays are typologically similar: both have a symbolic central image, life-affirming spirit, magic assistants, and a circular plot structure. The author of the article puts forward a hypothesis that translation can become a catalyst of interconnection at such a sophisticated level when two writers have a similar worldview and tend to create within the same aesthetics, as The Blue Bird and The Night Dances resemble tendencies within a common paradigm of creative thinking.

   and National Tradition in Avelina Perez's Deixa de tocala, Sam
SO SENDEBAR-REVISTA DE TRADUCCION E INTERPRETACION
AB This article analyses, by taking Avelina Perez's Deixa de tocala, Sam as a case study, how many of the conventions and structural elements typical of drama writing and translating seem to be questioned by the post-dramatic current. Firstly, because there are new alternative distribution and publication spaces that promote self-translation among playwrights from the bilingual territories of the Spanish State. The conception of "Interliterary community" of our geocultural space appears, therefore, reinforced in the practices of the new stage creators, who, in addition, understand self-translation as part of the creative process. Likewise, as this analysis shows, those aspects that may pose an obstacle to translation, such as the reproduction of the diglossic conflict, are neutralized. The "erasure" of the specificity of the different national traditions ultimately poses a threat to the survival of the peripheral cultural field.

TI LITERARY TRANSLATION AS A TEACHING TOOL IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE TEACHING?
   CASE STUDY: L2-TRANSLATION OF PRZED SKLEPEM JUBILERA BY KAROL WOJTYLA
SO ROCZNIKI HUMANISTYCZNE
AB In recent years there has been a reassessment of the role of translation and translations in foreign language teaching and education (Cook; Laviosa; Carreres, "Translation"). In 2001 the Common European Framework of Reference ( CEFR) recognized translation and interpretation as a language activity which is called mediation. Literary translation is being proposed as a mediation activity intended to develop the (written) mediation competence of foreign language learners. This article reports on the results of a case study in which we examine to what extend the L2 translation of drama indeed does enhance mediation skills of language learners. In this case study, we decided to investigate the extent to which Dutch language learners apply mediation strategies when translating an excerpt from Przed sklepem jubilera (The Jeweler's Shop) (written by Karol Wojtyla) in Dutch (L2), and the extent to which their strategies differ from those we found in the (official) Dutch translation of the play.

TI METAPHYSICAL TRANSLATION AS A RATIONALE FOR A NEW CULTURAL PROGRAM, OR
   THE DRAMA OF MISSPEAK EMBODIMENT
SO NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
AB In the history of culture, translation can not only adapt the values of a foreign culture or develop the potential of its own culture, but also substantiate a new cultural program, carrying out reassembly of culture on new grounds. Contrasting the foreignisation and domestication is not enough if the translation aims to change the very mode of cultural production and the very justification of culture, declaring the metaphysical motive as the main thing for the existence of a local culture. I prove that the shift cannot occur declaratively, but requires a hidden change in the functions of translation as a form of cultural consciousness, which acts outward in the form of slips, misunderstandings or misspeaks. At the same time, the cultural enthusiasm behind this translation does not make it possible to understand these reservations as simple inaccuracies or flaws, but only as necessary for self-justifying culture as a closed system, as nodes for building such closure. Such translations cannot be reduced to expressing the intellectual content of an epoch, but they represent the only way to translate those intellectual tasks that determine further discussions of the epoch. The example of one of the lines in the development of Russian philosophical idealism, associated with enhanced translation and interpretation of the summits of ancient philosophy, and the long-term consequences of its cultural program, proves the validity of the proposed translation research. It is proposed to conditionally call such a translation "metaphysical", taking in mind its programmatic role for the formulation of a new philosophical perspective, not confined to the arguments in the original and translation.

TI From litterature engagee to engaged translation: staging Jean-Paul
   Sartre's theatre as a challenge to Franco's rule in Spain
SO PERSPECTIVES-STUDIES IN TRANSLATION THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB The practice of creating translations that 'rouse, inspire, witness, mobilize, and incite to rebellion' is described by Maria Tymoczko, following Jean-Paul Sartre's litterature engagee, as 'engaged translation'. In Spain, under the Franco dictatorship (1939-1975), the theatre became a site of opposition to his rule and the creation of 'engaged' translations of foreign plays was one of the ways in which alternative social and political realities were transmitted to local audiences. This was particularly evident during the so-called apertura period (1962-1969), when Spain's political leaders embraced more liberal and outward-facing cultural policies as part of their efforts to ensure the regime's continuity. Drawing on archival evidence from the state censorship files held at Archivo General de la Administracion (AGA) in Alcala de Henares, this article considers how 'engaged' translations of Sartre's theatre were employed as instruments of cultural opposition to the Spanish dictatorship. It also argues that an analysis of the files both helps us to understand the role of censorship in shaping an official version of the past, and shines a light on the memory of a little-studied aspect of cultural activism in the Spanish theatre.

It will focus on three Japanese versions of one Russian text, Anton Chekhov's letters to his wife, all produced by Yuasa Yoshiko (family name first), a female translator of Russian literature, whose professional career began in the late 1920s. From the 1990s on, especially after the establishment of the Yuasa Yoshiko Award for the best translation of a foreign language stage play in 1994, she has become the focus of several academic studies and biographical works. Surprisingly enough, none of these emphasizes her translation activities or focuses on the texts of her translations. The purpose of the present study is to fill this lacuna in the research on Yuasa.

TI An analysis of translation errors in 5 literary genres based on American
   Translation Association (ATA) framework
SO COGENT ARTS & HUMANITIES
AB The analysis of translation errors holds a great deal of importance in the realm of translation studies. Accordingly, many pieces of research have been done on the topic of translation errors analysis in different text types including religious, journalistic, tourism, commercial, and legal texts. Nevertheless, no research has been conducted within literary genres with regard to translation errors from English to Persian. Thus, the present study aimed to analyze translation errors in five literary genres including prose, poetry, non-fiction, play, and media based on the American Translation Association (ATA) taxonomy. Three objectives were set for this study. The first aim was to distinguish the most frequent error types within each literary genre. The second objective was to determine whether there is any relationship between the text types and the errors. The third and last objective was to extract the possible pattern of committed errors within each genre. To conduct the research, 28 students of English Translation Studies were selected as the participants of the study. Translations' errors were identified and categorized based on the framework of the study. After analyzing the data, the findings revealed that the most frequent error types in the prose text were: verb tense (44.44%), cohesion (15.55%), and omission (11.11%); the most recurrent error types in the poetry text were punctuation (19.22%), terminology (16.16%), and omission (16.16%); mostly visited error types in the non-fiction text were terminology (33.58%), omission (16.29%), and punctuation (8.64%); omission (22.64%), verb tense (16.71%), and literalness (15.63%) were the most frequent error types committed in the play text; and misunderstanding (23.77%), omission (20.08%), and terminology (13.93%) were the most recurrent error types in the media text. The results obtained from the ANOVA test indicated that text type is significant except for non-fiction and play. Moreover, there was a similar pattern among errors in the five genres. The findings of the present study can be of help to translators, teachers, students, and researchers in the field of Translation Studies.

TI THE SERBIAN TRANSLATION OF HEIJERMANS'S OP HOOP VAN ZEGEN
SO ROCZNIKI HUMANISTYCZNE
AB One hundred years after its performance at the Serbian National Theatre in Novi Sad, the Serbian translation of Heijermans's Op Hoop van Zegen (The Good Hope), which has been preserved in handwritten form, was finally published for the first time. Further investigation has shown that this translation was made for the 1905 premiere at the National Theatre in Belgrade and that the translator used the German translation by Franziska de Graaff as the source text. A thorough analysis of his translation reveals his translation strategies but also shows that there are slight changes that could refer to his own input or to another source. Moreover, entire passages have been crossed out, but without any further explanation of that procedure.
   As for the reception of the performances, the sparse reviews testify that it was not an unqualified success with the public. An anonymous reviewer especially blamed Heijermans for his oversimplified criticism of capitalism. Two others saw the problem mainly in the poor staging and poor division of roles.
   Nevertheless, Heijermans appears to have left several traces in Serbian reception history, which is mainly due to his fame in Germany. After all, peripheral cultures reach each other easier through central mediators.

TI Swearing and the vulgarization hypothesis in Spanish audiovisual

SO JOURNAL OF PRAGMATICS
AB Drawing on the insights of pragmatics and translation studies, this article aims to probe the so-called vulgarization hypothesis in audiovisual translation (AVT) of Anglophone products into Spanish for the period 2006-2016. The hypothesis posits that contemporary American and British programs dubbed into European Spanish tend to increase the use of swearwords. To test this hypothesis I selected four series, a sitcom (The IT Crowd), a police drama (Chicago PD), a family drama (Brothers & Sisters) and a thriller (Eyewitness). After identifying a total of 412 coupled pairs in which swearwords were used in English, Spanish or both, I analysed the translation strategies. The analysis shows that the number of swearwords is increased by means of three strategies (namely addition, replacement of neutral words/expressions by swearwords, and intensification) in 53.14% of the cases. In contrast, toning down and omission strategies occur in 13.88% of the coupled pairs, thus supporting the hypothesis that contemporary AVT in Spain tends to vulgarize the original version.

TI On the virtuality of translation in Orientalism
SO TRANSLATION STUDIES
AB The relationship between translation and Orientalism is usually reduced to a binary distinction in which the Orient is either domesticated or foreignized in translation. In fact, translation in the context of Orientalism entails a more complex problem of representation that involves the positioning of agency and the reversal of power between Orientalists and local scholars. In order to offer an explanation of such a relationship, this article borrows from Edward W. Said the notions of the inside/outside paradox and sufficiency in Orientalist representation. Accordingly, translation in Orientalism is seen as the process of virtualization - it seeks to produce a version that is endowed with sufficient virtue to represent, or even replace, the original. The term virtual used in this article combines three senses derived from its etymology - power, virtue and potentiality. These three senses are seen as joining forces at work in the Orientalist translation. Virtuality also accounts for the manipulation that occurs when local scholars translate back, by pointing out the paradox they encounter when facing the challenge of representing themselves through translation. The translation of the Sanskrit drama akuntal in nineteenth-century Europe will be discussed as a case of the virtualization process in Orientalist translation.

SO JOURNAL OF EDUCATION CULTURE AND SOCIETY
AB Aim. The present study intends to explore how process drama can be effectively used and implemented in Indian classrooms. It further highlights the aspects of the conventional classrooms and discusses why Indian students are lacking in productive skills of the English language and how it can be diagnosed through using the theory and practice of process drama as an instructional method.
   Methods. Data collection method through a questionnaire has been used in the study and SPSS version 20 was implemented to access, analyse, and comprehend the data. The reliability and validity have been checked through a pilot study before conducting the questionnaire and the suggestions of an expert were incorporated.
   Research Restrictions. The present study is limited to the Indian classrooms, and more specifically, the respondents were chosen from undergraduate classrooms of different faculties with the aid of purposive sampling. Consequently, the results of the study cannot be implemented thoroughly, but the praxis of using process drama can be a potent strategy to teach English in ESL classrooms, according to the level, background, and nature of the learners.
   Practical Application. The findings of the study clearly indicate that the use of process drama in classroom pedagogy has a positive impact on receptive and productive language skills.
   Cognitive value. The modern classroom pedagogy needs an approach of teaching which can foster the learning process more easily and emphasise all four language learning skills in an effective way.

SO ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SLAWISTIK
AB After 1989/90, and especially since the end of the 1990s, remarkable change has been going on in the Polish (Schultze and Makarczyk-Schuster 2008; Burzyliska 2013) and the Russian (Davydova 2005; Gob ler and Rodewald 2013) theatre landscapes. While Russian experts see an "end of a theatre epoch" (Davydova) Polish specialists observe a return to fairly stable working conditions (Burzyliska). What interests most, is the unprecedented boom of new plays mainly variants of non-literary drama since the end of the 1990s. The Polish plays and much of Russian "New Drama" (Beumers and Lipovetsky 2009) show thematical and structural similarities, but also differences. Comparative analyses of 14 Polish plays in Russian translation mainly based on Roman Pawlowski's representative choice of dramatists and theatre texts ("Antologija sovremennoj pol'skoj dramaturgii", 2010), together with analogies and differences in the source and receiving cultures, explore the type of translational challenge in nonliterary drama and the handling of the cultural technique drama translation by the Russian translators.

TI Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 6 overexpression plays a major
   role in the translational control of gallbladder cancer
SO JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
AB Background Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a rare neoplasia of the biliary tract with high mortality rates and poor prognosis. Signs and symptoms of GBC are not specific and often arise at late stage of disease. For this reason, diagnosis is typically made when the cancer is already in advanced stages, and prognosis for survival is less than 5 years in 90% of cases. Biomarkers to monitor disease progression and novel therapeutic alternative targets for these tumors are strongly required. Commonly, dysregulated protein synthesis contributes to carcinogenesis and cancer progression. In this case, protein synthesis directs translation of specific mRNAs, and, in turn, promotes cell survival, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis of tumors. In eukaryotes, protein synthesis is regulated at its initiation, which is a rate-limiting step involving eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs). We hypothesize that eIFs represent crossroads in the development of GBC, and might serve as potential biomarkers. The study focus was the role of eIF6 (an anti-association factor for the ribosomal subunits) in GBC. Methods In human GBC samples, the expression of eIF6 was analyzed biochemically at the protein (immunohistochemistry, immunoblot analyses) and mRNA levels (qRT-PCR). Results High levels of eIF6 correlated with shorter overall survival in biliary tract cancer (BTC) patients (n = 28). Immunohistochemical data from tissue microarrays (n = 114) demonstrated significantly higher expression levels of eIF6 in GBC compared to non-neoplastic tissue. Higher eIF6 expression on protein (immunoblot) and mRNA (qRT-PCR) level was confirmed by analyzing fresh frozen GBC patient samples (n = 14). Depletion of eIF6 (using specific siRNA-mediated knockdown) in Mz-ChA-2 and TFK-1 cell lines inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. Conclusion Our data indicates that eIF6 overexpression plays a major role in the translational control of GBC, and indicates its potential as a new biomarker and therapeutic target in GBC.

TI ?I?M THE EMPTY STAGE WHERE VARIOUS ACTORS ACT OUT VARIOUS PLAYS?-THEATRE
   TRANSLATORS? VIEW OF THEIR WORK
SO CADERNOS DE TRADUCAO
AB When theatre translators are commissioned to translate a play, they know the stage it is intended for, the director and sometimes even the actors. In a small country, theatre translation has always been significant, and even today translated plays account for around half of the annual performances on the Finnish stage. This situation has triggered off the following piece of research into how theatre translators themselves see their own role in the preparation of a production and, also, how closely their work follows the one that actors do in constructing characters. The two questions set for the analysis were: 1) what is theatre translators' experience of their physical participation in the construction of a performance?; and 2) how far does their psychological involvement go into the lives of the play's characters? I drew my material from two collected works of theatre translators' self-reflections that I have edited in Finland. Of the two compilations, I selected 27 articles written by theatre translators. My method was Critical Discourse Analysis, and my toolbox consisted of discourse, repertoire, (theme), topic and metaphorical narratives. The analysis revealed repertoires that consisted of the physical participation in the production process that fell mostly in the category of Exclusion or Liminality, and to a much lesser extent to that of Inclusion. The answers to the second question concerning the psychological involvement in the lives of the play's characters fell mostly in the repertoire which I labelled as the Brechtian Verfremdung, or Distancing and somewhat less to the repertoire of Emotional Recall, or Memory, of the Stanislavski Method.

TI Yeats's noh and world drama: foreign form in tandem with local materials
SO NEOHELICON
AB In an essay on the Japanese noh drama, Fenollosa on the noh, Ernest Fenollosa (1853-1908) provides a unique but reverse case of Franco Moretti's concept of world literature. Moretti argues that the compromise between the foreign and the local is so ubiquitous that the encounter of Western forms and local reality did indeed produce everywhere a structural compromise. I agree with Moretti that the problem is always a structural compromise between foreign form and local materials in the field of world literature. However, I contend that what is at stake in world literature is rather the problem of balancing between close readings of local/global materials and distant readings of discourse at large in structural reconstruction. Even a prominent critic of world literature like T. S. Eliot fails to see the complicated nature of William Butler Yeats's transcultural interweaving between the foreign form of the Japanese noh drama and the local materials of Irish plays. In this context, I have attempted to provide a case of balancing between the foreign form of the Japanese noh and local materials found in Irish plays, thereby suggesting a new model for the study of world literature. Stimulated by Pound and Fenollosa's translations of the noh plays, and having envisioned Japanese noh plays as the visionary model for his future theatre, Yeats had a new vision of world drama by investigating the potential theories of mask and ghost, thereby anticipating the vision of transcultural/transnational world literature and drama.

TI Translating the other: Communal TV watching of Korean TV drama
SO JOURNAL OF PRAGMATICS
AB Our research is situated in the field of the pragmatics of fiction (Jucker and Locher, 2017; Messerli, 2017), and explores a website that makes Asian drama series and movies accessible to an international audience by means of fan generated subtitles in over 150 languages (www.viki.com; Dwyer, 2012, 2017). The streaming site offers a social network and participatory element in that it provides viewers with different possibilities of participation. Next to producing subtitles in teams, members can comment on episodes and actors, rate shows, produce their own videos, write to each other, etc. This paper explores the possibility of viewers commenting on the episode while it is being watched as a dynamic form of active reception. These comments are time-aligned with the video, which acts as the pivot of the interaction. Viewers can read other fans' comments, and can contribute their own comments and thus their own voice to this additional communal layer of drama series reception. Despite the fact that viewers typically view episodes and read/write comments asynchronously, a simultaneous viewing experience among an international community is created. We present a case study of the viewing of the first episode of two series and show how the commenters negotiate a number of issues, which include expectations about genre, character development, intertextuality and culture. We demonstrate that engaging with the video through written comments, engaging with each other in these comments and participating cross-linguistically are highly interactive, pragmatic achievements between different modes of communication of which the video itself is the starting point. Crucially, the timed comments also contribute to translating and making sense of the cultural 'other' as rendered in the videos. This is particularly the case in the comments on culture triggered by the video but also transpires in dialogues between the members. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Negotiating identity roles during the process of online collaborative
   translation: An ethnographic approach
SO TRANSLATION STUDIES
AB This article examines the processes of online collaborative translation, focusing on the various roles the participants play through their mutual engagement. To enhance our understanding of collaborative translation, Yeeyan, the platform where it takes place, is theorized as a broad community of practice consisting of multiple sub-communities. Supported by Yeeyan's participatory mechanisms, the participants engaging in the collaborative translation actively perform specific roles. Drawing on ethnographic data collected from fieldwork in Yeeyan, a set of materials are analyzed in a holistic manner: online materials documenting Yeeyan's community structure, five Yeeyaners' profiles, parts of the translation manuscripts and two excerpts of the interactions between the participants. The analysis, premised on the theory of communities of practice, reveals that collaborative translation in online translation communities like Yeeyan is an experience of meaning negotiation through which the participants play a variety of roles at different stages as they engage in the shared practice.

TI Transpacific theatre: Lin Yutang's self-translation as a creative act
SO ASIA PACIFIC TRANSLATION AND INTERCULTURAL STUDIES
AB This article examines Lin Yutang's self-translation of his Chinese play Zi Jian Nan Zi (offspring(sic)(sic)offspring) as Confucius Saw Nancy for the 1930s American audience, in order to explore the creativity manifested in the process of translation that secures the performability of the translated play. Drawing upon Lin's understanding of the notion of "self-translation", namely, what he sees as a movement between identities of his Chinese self and English-speaking Other, this article analyses three strategies that he adopts to reinvent the original text for American audiences: the mirroring-effect, musicality and stage directions. It argues that the performability of this Chinese play demands both linguistic and dramaturgical intervention from the translator. Keenly aware that a translated play, like the original, is staged by actors for a live audience, Lin intends to create a new play that demonstrates his understanding of self-translation as what goes beyond a mere search for the equivalence of meanings between the source and target texts. This article concludes that for Lin what begins with self-translation eventually leads to an elaborate creation, and it is this creation generated by his concern with the audience over time that secures the performability of the play.

TI Translation, Presumed Innocent Translation and Ideology in Turkey
SO TRANSLATOR
AB In late Ottoman society, in the 19th century translation was instrumental in the emergence of new literary genres such as the novel and western-style drama. It maintained its significance and influence in the early Republican period, starting in 1923 Apart from its literary significance, an interesting aspect of the trajectory followed by translation in Turkey concerns the way it has conspicuously allied itself with political and ideological agendas, such as westernization, Marxism and Islamism, to mention a few. This paper explores the ideological entanglements of translation in Turkey in the 20th century. It examines the discourse that emerged around translation at certain moments during that period and argues that translation served as a mirror, reflecting the literary and cultural 'lacks' of the target system, as much as it was meant to import new forms and ideas which would eventually help Turkish society overcome its perceived deficiencies The study also problematizes the ways in which the translators subject position has been suppressed, especially in the discourse of translators reflecting upon their own work; and concludes that this self-effacing altitude seems to have become part of the professional identity of the Turkish translator.

TI Speech corpus-based study on the speakability in translation of Chinese
   classical operas
SO BABEL-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE LA TRADUCTION-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF
   TRANSLATION
AB Speakability in drama involves the level of ease with which an individual can coordinate the pronunciation, singing, and emotion of a text. In translations of classical Chinese operas, reproducing the speakability of the original can determine the success of the stage performance of the opera. However, speakability in such translations has not been explored in the literature. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the similarity of the speakability in translations of An Enchanting Dream from The Peony Pavilion to that of the original Chinese through a corpus-driven investigation of versions of the opera annotated by Xu Yuanchong and translated by Xu Yuanchong and Xu Ming, Wang Rongpei, and Cyril Birch. We developed a prosodic phonological evaluation system in which duration and pitch were used to compare the source text and target texts by using InterPhonic 5.0 and Praat software. The results indicated that for duration when the context and characterization in the drama are considered, Wang's translation did not adequately convey emotions. For pitch, the tone ranges of Xu and Xu's translation fluctuated more drastically, which more effectively conveyed the emotional changes of the original text. Furthermore, the waviness of the pitches in Xu and Xu's translation was similar to that of the original text. In this study, relative corpora were developed to determine the translated speakability of a Chinese classical opera. Our results may be valuable to translation studies and for the dissemination of traditional Chinese culture.

TI Process, practice and landscapes of reception: An ethnographic study of

SO TRANSLATION STUDIES
AB This article discusses the reception of translated literature in the theatre by reflecting on an innovative theatre translation project. Drawing on the notion of landscapes as spaces of cultural flux (Appadurai 1996), the authors offer an analysis of the multiple agencies that mediate such reception. By reflecting on their own experiences of translating Rani Moorthy's play A Handful of Henna for the Italian stage, the authors propose a view of translation as a social dialogue making visible the multiple negotiations and conflicts that characterize the process of translation. While there is ample precedent of reflective accounts of translation practice (Booth 2008; Venuti 1998) and ethnographic approaches in translation studies (Buzelin 2006; Sturge 2007), this article brings together for the first time self-reflection and ethnography offering a view from the agent (Simeoni 1995, 457) that acknowledges and foregrounds the scholar's own participation and involvement (448).

TI Receptive Aesthetic Criteria: Reader Comparisons of Two Finnish
   Translations of Hamlet
SO MULTICULTURAL SHAKESPEARE-TRANSLATION APPROPRIATION AND PERFORMANCE
AB This article examines the subjective aesthetic criteria used to assess two Finnish translations of Hamlet, one by Eeva-Liisa Manner (1981) and the other by Matti Rossi (2013), both accomplished translators for the stage. A survey consisting of one general question ("Briefly describe your idea of how Shakespeare translation should sound in Finnish, and what you think are the qualities of a good Shakespeare translation") and five text extracts was distributed on paper and electronically, generating 50 responses. For the extracts, respondents were asked whether one or the other translation most closely dorresponded to their idea of what a Shakespeare translation should sound like and why, along with questions on whether they would prefer to see or read one or the other. The results show that there are no strong shared expectancy norms in Finland regarding Shakespeare translation. Manner was generally felt to be more concise and poetic, while Rossi was praised for his exquisite use of modern Finnish. Respondents agreed that rhythm was an important criterion, but disagreed on what sorts of rhythms they preferred. Translation of the "to be or not to be" speech raised the most passions, with many strongly preferring Manner's more traditional translation. The results suggest that Shakespeare scholars would do well to take variations in expectancy norms into account when assessing and analysing Shakespeare in translation.

TI Attitudes of professional translators and translation students towards
   order management and translator platforms
SO JOURNAL OF SPECIALISED TRANSLATION
AB Technology plays an important role in the language industry. Investigating computer-assisted translation tools and machine translation systems is a continuing concern within translation studies. Among translation technologies, translator platforms, which are used both by translators and clients, have received scant attention in the research literature despite the fact that they can facilitate important tasks for translators such as order management. This paper provides an initial attempt to define translator platforms and their purpose. Moreover, it analyses the attitude towards these platforms among translators at different professional stages and with different years of experience. This study consists of a qualitative and a quantitative part. Semi-structured expert interviews and a survey among students in the field of specialised translation have revealed the differences regarding (expectations of) translation management and attitudes towards translator platforms. Especially professional translators who have already gained a foothold in the translation sector and are satisfied with their order management are sceptical about translator platforms providing order management features. Students, regardless of their practical translation experience, have a more positive attitude towards translator platforms. They appreciate the automatically generated quotations and invoices as well as client acquisition.

With reference to the "cultural turn", Bassnett's 1998 essay on the "translation turn in cultural studies" is analysed, her specific definition of "cultural studies" clarified and her view of the "translation turn" quoted, again with reference to drama translation. Using the broader concept of Kulturwissenschaften, the possibilities of a "translation turn" as based on "competence between cultures" are tentatively discussed and illustrated by authentic examples. In conclusion it is pointed that a translation turn of this kind presupposes a balanced plurality of languages and cultures across which such communication can take place.

TI GOLDONI IN THE TRANSLATION OF AMFITEATROV'S FAMILY
SO STUDIA LITTERARUM
AB Translations of Goldoni's plays into Russian by A.V. and A.I. Amfiteatrov, a married couple who compiled Goldoni's first collection in Russia, illustrate two basic approaches to translating fiction. In the plays that have not lost their repertoire potential, the translators depart from the original far enough, omitting dozens of phrases and whole replicas. The translation of The Comic Theater, a staged dramatic manifesto of Goldoni, pedantically follows the original, not only not allowing any omissions but also adhering to lexical and syntactical literalism. As a rule, free translation and accurate translation alternate as two models or templates in the history of translation. In the mentioned Goldoni's collection, two alternative translations present themselves as two equal modes of transmitting a text into the foreign language which seems to be a rare, if not a unique phenomenon.

TI Studies of British Drama and Poetry in China in 2013
SO FOREIGN LITERATURE STUDIES
AB In 2013, domestic scholars studied playwrights and poets of each period of British literature and their works from multiple perspectives, yielding fairly rich achievements. Meanwhile, contributions from translation field promoted the acceptance of English drama and poetry in China. Through the survey, and analysis of the research project, monographs, complied and translated works, and journal papers etc. achieved in these two domestic study fields in 2013, this report discloses the following three common problems: (1) Scholars tend to concentrate on certain writers, works, or certain literary period, thus there is an imbalance in studies. (2) Some scholars are weak in theoretical foundation, and lack of innovative research methods, which makes them vulnerable to "aphasia" among foreign academic circles. (3)The amount of translated materials is inadequate, and quality needs to be improved. This report hence suggests that domestic scholars could focus more on study of writers and works of a particular period, monograph, inter-disciplinary study, as well as introduction and translation of foreign academic works.

TI Audio description as audio drama - a practitioner's point of view
SO PERSPECTIVES-STUDIES IN TRANSLATOLOGY
AB In discussing audio description (AD) as a form of translation, there is a tendency to focus on AD as a written text. A key element, easy to overlook, is that AD is always received aurally, together with the existing dialogue and soundscape. AD therefore translates a film or play into a form of audio drama. Insights from the field of Radio Studies reveal the ways in which sound works to produce more vivid mental imagery. A better understanding of the interaction between sound effects and audio description can help improve access to audiovisual media for people who are dependent solely on auditory information. Drawing on practical examples, this article suggests that sound, as much as vision, influences choices in AD.

AB Throughout the cultural history of modern Egypt, language has been a site for constructing and contesting different versions of national identity While Classical Arabic (fusha) has been widely recognized by many as the legitimate expression of an Arab-Islamic identity that Egypt partakes of there have been attempts by Egyptian Intellectuals to forge and promote a unique Egyptian identity distinct from the Arab-Islamic geo-political and socio-cultural sphere Egyptian vernacular Arabic ('ammiyya) has been mainly deployed as the distinctive mark of this identity While recognizing that the two categories of fusha and 'ammiyya and the arbitrary divide between them are epistemological constructs that have been sustained and promoted by a number of institutional and discursive practices, including a linguistic discourse couched in a modernist understanding of reality this article seeks to pinpoint the social/cultural economy of these two constructs in the field of drama translation in Egypt It then examines a translation of Othello produced by Moustapha Safouan in 1998, in which he negotiates Egyptian identity through a strategic use of 'ammiyya. The discussion of language and cultural practices in Egypt and Safouan's translation draws on Pierre Bourdieu's concept of doxa.

TI Repurposing Romantic Drama in Late-Nineteenth-Century Egypt: Najib
   al-Haddad's Arabizations of Victor Hugo
SO JOURNAL OF ARABIC LITERATURE
AB At the end of the nineteenth century, Najib al-Haddad adapted two dramas by Victor Hugo for The Egyptian Patriotic Troupe. Al-Haddad rewrote Hugo's Hernani as Hamdan, transferring the story from the Spanish court of 1519 to Andalucia under 'Abd al-Rahman II. Les Burgraves became Tha'rat al-'arab (Revenge of the Arabs), and transformed from a play about Barbarossa and the Holy Roman Empire into a play about a pre-Islamic Lakhmid king's struggle to restore unified Arab rule in the Arabian peninsula. I argue that Al-Haddad's adaptations anachronistically placed modern ideas in the Arab past-characterizing shura as the election of leaders, using sha'b to mean a sovereign people, and calling for Arab cultural unity and revival. Al-Haddad's adaptations transformed the nationalism of Hugo's drama into calls for Arab solidarity. In producing these plays, The Egyptian Patriotic Troupe embodied an Arab past overlaid with modern communal identities.

TI Literary translation and conceptual metaphors: From movement to
   performance
SO TRANSLATION STUDIES
AB Literary translators and translation, when noticed at all, have a poor public image inconsistent with the evidence of skill and effort shown in translators' essays, postscripts and interviews, and with the respect shown to literary translation practice in translation studies in general. This article suggests that much of this negativity results from the entailments, or logical implications, of the dominant conceptual metaphors of translation: movement and replacement. Conceptual metaphors powerfully shape perceptions and expectations, but unlike consciously applied metaphors their effects go largely unnoticed. By comparing the current dominant metaphors of translation to an alternative of translation as performance we can see that many of the common concepts of translation are entailments of metaphor rather than intrinsic features of translation. The performance metaphor is used as a contrast because it has very different entailments, thus highlighting the effects of the current metaphors and also providing a possible alternative for translators and students of translation.

TI Moments of relational work in English fan translations of Korean TV
   drama
SO JOURNAL OF PRAGMATICS
AB This study is situated in the field of the pragmatics of fiction and audio-visual translation studies and explores renditions of relational work and im/politeness in the English fan subtitles of Korean dramas, as provided by the platform www.viki.com (Dwyer, 2012, 2017; Locher & Messerli, 2020). Within story lines, the indexical potential of language is used (among others) for character positioning, character development, relationship development and (indirectly) reflection of cultural norms and expectations (Planchenault, 2017). Fictional data is thus an ideal source for studying linguistic ideologies about relational work. The case of Korean is challenging for subtitlers since it dynamically indexes relationships through a complex system of grammaticalized politeness forms and a set of honorific morphemes and vocabulary (see, e.g., Rhee, 2019). The Korean nuances often cannot be translated as there is no straightforward correspondence to indexes of politeness in the target languages. Nevertheless, the English subtitles give access to an abundance of foregrounded relational work moments. The paper works on 215 scenes (from 4 dramas) and explores in what ways the complex Korean politeness system and the fictional play with this system is made accessible in the subtitles for non-Korean audiences. Four themes emerged: (1) character address term negotiations; (2) character meta-comments on relational work; (3) character meta-discussions on role understanding; and (4) subtitler meta-comments on language and culture. The results demonstrate two main issues: (a) these relational work moments are intricately connected with (character) identity construction in the fictional artefact; (b) the subtitlers take an active role in translating cultural assumptions about relational work and lean towards foreignization rather than domestication.

TI Literary translation - UNESCO collection of representative works
SO BABEL-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE LA TRADUCTION-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF
   TRANSLATION
AB This article deals with literary retranslation, with its causes and its characteristics. The analysis is illustrated by examples taken mainly from Swedish literary texts translated and retranslated into French.
   The article examines the particular premises of retranslation as opposed to those of first translation and the different roles which, depending on these premises, the individual translator faces in the translation process. It stresses the importance of the "subjective traces" that every translator leaves in his/her translation. The analysis takes into account a number of factors liable to provoke the retranslation of a literary work: ageing, interpretative variety, fidelity, translational style, etc.
   The article further discusses translation problems with respect to such concepts as spoken language, dialect, language of poetry and of drama, all of which important causes for retranslation. It also addresses the concept of censorship, which, in the history of literary translation, has frequently deformed and sometimes even mutilated important original literary texts and which, consequently, has been a determining factor in the decision to submit an already translated text to a new translation.
   Finally, the article briefly touches upon the concept of revised translation, which can be said to occupy a middle position between the existing translation of a literary text and its retranslation. In this connexion the article also mentions the recourse to translation from a language other than the original language. It seems inevitable that the intermediate language inflicts a number of semantic, stylistic and pragmatic losses upon the translation in relation to the original text, and it is only natural that this type of translation should be a common cause for retranslation.

TI Teaching and Learning Strategies for Specialised Translation in MLA: The
   Project in Technical Translation Class
SO LITERA-JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE LITERATURE AND CULTURE STUDIES
AB This article describes the teaching and learning strategies that can be used at academic levels in Modern Languages Applied (MLA) study programmes, in the domain of teaching specialised translation, particularly technical translation. Among the practical techniques mentioned by specialists (Ballard, 2005, Marquant, Lavaul-Olleon, 2007) as role-plays, simulations, guided research, projects, this article focuses on the project as a teaching and learning strategy for specialised translation in MLA study programmes. This articles outlines the methodological aspects related to the project's progress, the tasks assigned to students and the results obtained. The evaluation of students' work enabled us to identify the type of difficulties that students have to deal with when translating technical texts (from French into Romanian), the terminological problems being considered, by far, the most prevalent issue. The issues that students have referred to as problematic were the technical terms formed by attaching affixes, as well as compound nouns, especially in the case of terms with no terminological correspondent in Romanian language. In order to validate the terminological solutions they found, the students studied similar written documents or talked to experts. The students' feedback following this learning experience was a positive one and they expressed great satisfaction having been able to achieve the tasks assigned. We believe that the methodological aspects described have a number of advantages: the students benefit from a systematic method that enables them to follow the project's progress, to evaluate the stage of their projects, and to take measures in order to adjust the learning process.

TI Theatre as a "translation zone': multilingualism, identity and the
   performing body in the work of Teatro delle Albe
SO TRANSLATOR
AB This article argues that the theatre is a site of multiple forms of translation. Alongside textual travel from page to stage, from the past to the present and from language to language, theatrical performance also creates translation zones' where languages and cultures are negotiated, challenged and hybridized. By focussing on the practice of intercultural theatre, I investigate the way in which multiple languages on the stage interact with the performing body of the actor. Paying attention to how linguistic and cultural identities are constructed on the stage, I examine four productions by arguably the most significant intercultural company in the Italian theatrical landscape, Teatro delle Albe. My purpose is to argue that translation in the theatre occurs not only discursively, through subsequent rewritings of a foreign text, but also performatively, through the negotiation of multiple languages in performance and the creative juxtaposition of those languages with the actor's body, ethnicity and role. Translation, in this sense, is understood - in the direction of much contemporary culturally-oriented translation studies - less as a communicative act aimed at transferring texts or conveying ideas than as a fundamentally hybridizing instance', which is at once linguistic, cultural, aesthetic and political.

TI HISTORY OF RUSSIAN RECEPTION OF DRAMA I.-V. GOETHE'S "TORQUATO TASSO"
SO NAUCHNYI DIALOG
AB The history of Russian translations of the I.-V. Goethe's drama "Torquato Tasso" (1789) is discussed in the article. Responses testifying to the familiarity with this work of many Russian writers, in particular, V. A. Zhukovsky, N. V. Kukolnik, N. A. Polevoy, I. V. Kireevsky, N. I. Nadezhdin, I. S. Turgenev, A. I. Herzen and others are systematized. The history of Russian Reception of the "Torquato Tasso", dating back to the 1840s (A. N. Strugovschikov, N. M. Satin, A. N. Yakhontov, etc.), and its influence on aesthetic reflection in the era of romanticism and afterwards is discussed in the article. Particular attention is paid to the previously unknown translation of V. G. Benediktov (presumably the 1850s), preserved in the archives of the writer in the Russian National Library. Subsequent translations created by V. A. Sorgenfrey (1920-1921) and S. M. Soloviev (1933) are also analyzed. With the involvement of diary, epistolary and memoir materials, the activity of A. A. Blok as a translation editor by V. A. Sorgenfrey is conceptualized. The relevance of the study is due to the need to clarify the large-scale picture of the translation and literary critical reception of the West European classics in Russia.

TI The "integrity' of the translated play-text
SO TRANSLATOR
AB This article makes a case for reassessing the integrity' (meaning: completeness and condition of being unmarred) of stage-oriented translations as written texts. First, I argue that theatre translations can fully lend themselves to a literary analysis, which leads us to make a case for studying them with a diachronic perspective, and to consider them as historiographical tools. The idea of integrity of translated play-texts, however, faces a major obstacle: not only has the inseparability of text and performance been put forward by a prominent branch of semiotics, but this inseparability is argued to be a fundamental component of the translation process by critics and practitioners. The idea of an integrity' (meaning: completeness) of the target text is unquestionably negated in certain types of collaborative practices. After considering some of the main criticisms put forward, the article will envisage cases in which the textual integrity can still be validated. Without altogether refuting these objections, this article still maintains that, at least, the integrity (meaning: unmarred, unviolated) of the target text, in some cases, can be preserved through the processes of collaborative translation.

TI Translation Principles of Vadim Shershenevich and Their Implementation
   in Translations of Playwrights of William Shakespeare: "King John" and
   "Cymbeline"
SO NAUCHNYI DIALOG
AB The article is devoted to comprehension of the translational reception of William Shakespeare's work in the legacy of Vadim Shershenevich (1893-1942) in the context of his author's translation strategies. The novelty of the study is connected with the identification of Shershenevich's translation strategies as an adherent of "accurate translation", with the reconstruction of the history of the poet's translation achievements in the field of Shakespeariana. The authors comprehend Shershenevich's report on the principles of Shakespeare's translation, preserved in the Russian State Archive of Literature and Art funds, and analyze the application of these principles (equilinearity, equirhythm, preservation of rhyme and figurative structure) in the little-known translation of the chronicle "King John" and in the translation of the play "Cymbeline". The question is raised about Shershenevich's two main translation strategies in relation to Shakespeare: accurate translation (in the texts under study) and free adaptation of texts for the stage, corresponding to the avant-garde understanding of theater as an art that develops outside of direct dependence on literature (when he works with Shakespeare as a librettist, in particular, participating in the creation of the comic opera Gemini based on Shakespeare's Twelfth Night). The relevance of the study is related to the need to rethink the scope and significance of Shakespeare's reception in the culture of the Silver Age.

TI Classical Chinese theatre for different times: French translations and
   retranslations
SO ASIA PACIFIC TRANSLATION AND INTERCULTURAL STUDIES
AB Like all rewritings, a translation is highly related to the environmental factors - social, temporal, cultural - in relation to which it is produced. Much more than the original works, which are timeless, translations depend on the particular time that fashioned them. It can even be said that there is no translation "forever": the translation must always be redone. If the original is never outdated, the translation must always be updated, otherwise, it will become incomprehensible. It is for good reason that retranslation is a concept in its own right in the field of Translation Studies. The case of the presence of Chinese theatre in the French language is a good example of this need to translate and retranslate again in order to meet the expectations of different historical periods, including ours. This relationship has a history of more than three centuries, which gives us enough perspective to understand how different eras produced their own Chinese dramas.

TI The Stage Against the Scaffold: French Adaptations of George Lillo's
   London Merchant
SO EARLY MODERN FRENCH STUDIES
AB This article considers French theatrical adaptations of George Lillo's 1731 tragedy, The London Merchant, or, The History of George Barnwell. It asks how authors engaged with concepts of crime and punishment in the process of translation across cultures, genres and theatrical traditions. Following analysis of Lillo's play, itself adapted from a seventeenth-century ballad, the article focuses on French rewritings of the George Barnwell story in the years following Diderot's theorization of the drame. I suggest that by the 1760s and 1770s, the more French playwrights attempted to humanize Barnwell's crime, the harder it became to preserve the meaning of the executions that conclude Lillo's play. The ways in which the meanings of the scaffold shifted in these theatrical adaptations suggest broader changes in discourses of punishment in 1760s and 1770s France.

TI ETHICAL TRADITIONS IN BRITISH DRAMA A Case Study of Oscar Wilde and
   George Bernard Shaw
SO KRITIKA KULTURA
AB Victorian literature, both its creation and criticism, mainly focused on the significance of morality and religion, and viewed literature as beneficial to the heart of mankind. Oscar Wilde, widely considered as an aesthete, is one such literary figure of the Victorian era who espouses the doctrine of "art for art's sake:' His artistic style incorporates rich ethical connotations, and the interplay between aesthetics and ethics presents characteristics of both conflict and integration in his works. On the other hand, the problem plays of Henrik Ibsen, the so-called father of modern drama, exerted a profound influence on George Bernard Shaw, the great British dramatist of the twentieth century. Shaw's creation of problem plays is directly attributable to Ibsen, and he creatively adapted the Norwegian playwright's writing techniques for his only treatise of drama theory in 1891, The Quintessence of Ibsenism, which fully expressed his basic understanding of the dramatic arts. Aside from disagreements regarding artistic ideas, both Wilde and Shaw emphasize that the primary task of artistic creation is to reflect social problems, and that the degeneration of human morality is the root of all social ills. They also believe that traditional moral standards may not always meet the requirements of social reality, therefore it is necessary to find a set of ethics to solve social problems. In this way, both Wilde's and Shaw's dramas dearly reflect the ethical tradition concerning social issues.

SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF FRENCH STUDIES
AB As a way of studying the decision-making process in theatre translation, one can examine Yasmina Reza's "Art" and its British and American translations, whose stage productions met with huge acclaim in Great Britain and the US. The translator of both texts, Christopher Hampton, chooses a target over a source approach, aiming first and foremost at performance rather than silent reading. This process of "domestication" of the French original for adaptation to the Anglo-Saxon theatrical context is evident in the transpositions of language registers, in the descriptions of the white painting at the heart of the "drama", and in the erasure of the final line's philosophical intent. This last point in particular raises the question of how far a translator can go in terms of domestication without relieving the play of its original complexities.

TI Images of Jews and Judaism in Georg Rollenhagen's drama 'Vom reichen
   Manne und armen Lazaro'
SO NEOPHILOLOGUS
AB Georg Rollenhagen of Magdeburg (1542-1609) wielded considerable influence as headmaster of the best-attended Gymnasium in German-speaking lands. His work Froschmeuseler from 1595 (inspired in part by Luther's translation of the Bible) demonstrates his diverse interests in classical Greek and fabulistic themes. He was one of the authors of his time who, writing in the New High German vernacular, recognized the unifying potential of burgeoning European literatures. The scholarship on Rollenhagen is scant. It consists of a few articles on Froschmeuseler and biographical sketches. Of particular interest is Rollenhagen's Von Reichen Manne und armen Lazaro, eine deutsche Action (1590), a drama that interprets the New Testament parable of Lazarus and the rich man through the lens of Lutheranism and figures the Jews as prominent players in its overall allegorical meaning. This article examines the images of the Jews and Judaism found in Rollenhagen's drama vis-a-vis tropes from Martin Luther's rhetoric on the Jews.

TI The censorship of theatre translations under Franco: the 1960s
SO PERSPECTIVES-STUDIES IN TRANSLATOLOGY
AB Over the last decade, Spain's censorship records have been used by translation studies scholars as the main source to reconstruct the history of translated culture. Censorship archives are virtually the only source of information to research the history of theatre translations in Spain, since they provide access to materials that range from contextual information to actual manuscripts (from draft versions to final censored texts). This contribution will provide a glimpse into the history of theatre translations in the 1960s, a period of political openness from within the Ministry in charge of theatre censorship and of intense activity on Spanish stages. Using textual and contextual evidence gathered from Spanish censorship archives, the actual process that led to the 1966 stage production of Albee's Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf? will help illustrate how play scripts were evaluated when submitted to the censors' ideologically-biased scrutiny and to what extent ideological manipulation was forced into the production script. Such evidence shows that foreign plays were integrated in to Spanish theatre through translation and adaptation. It also reveals the role of censors, stage directors and professional translators in the censorship process that can be traced from the actual records.

This topic will not be approached in strictly theoretical terms; instead, a Relevance Theory perspective is applied to a concrete translation case of a particular play. This approach is adopted in order to detect the pragmatic importance both author and translator assigned to the contextual knowledge revealed by these metatextual elements to either source or target audience. This paper tried to show that in one particular case under observation (i.e. a particular Romanian play and one of its translations into English), metatextual elements suffered modifications intended to ensure relevance in the target culture.

TI From Staged to Disguised Self-Translation: Heine and Celan in France
SO ARCADIA
AB Heinrich Heine and Paul Celan have often been compared, mainly because of their shared Parisian exile and Jewish identity. Yet we should add another dimension to this comparison, by examining the authors' relationship to the French versions of their texts. In fact, although Heine and Celan have always considered themselves as German-speaking writers, their perfect bilingualism and active participation in French literary circles made it possible for them to exert an early and considerable influence upon their own reception in France. This particularly affected the translation of their works, which were intensely managed and controlled by both poets. However, their influence took very different forms: Heine alleged to be the author of the French version of his writings, hiding the work of the translator, whereas Celan never wanted to appear as a self-translator, even if he played a key role in the development of the French translations of his works. Thus Heine's French works appear to be staged self-translations, produced mostly by French translators, while many of the French translations of Celan are actually very close to disguised self-translation. In both cases the original connection between the author and his text is upheld and the movement of estrangement and disappropriation, inherent in translation, is impeded or even stopped.

TI THE TRANSLATION OF THE THEATER TEXT: PERFORMANCES OF A POETIC
SO REVISTA DA ANPOLL
AB In order for the translation of theatrical texts not to cause their specificities to be lost, it is necessary to take into account all the scenic elements that should compose it. This operation evokes the iterative condition of drama texts which mobilizes them from the beginning, thus allowing the play to work in times and spaces completely different from those in which it was written. This work intends to analyze how this "genre" of translation, by updating the performative powers of such texts, ends up echoing an ethical-aesthetic dimension present in the assumptions of a certain criticism described by Walter Benjamin in The Concept of Art Criticism in German Romanticism.

   Testimony, Memory and Translation
SO URDIMENTO-REVISTA DE ESTUDOS EM ARTES CENICAS
AB At a broader theoretical level, the subject matter of this article is theater as a sui generis artistic medium of testimony and memory of the Shoah (according to scholars like Robert Skloot and Grzegorz Niziolek, among others). This issue is addressed in the background of Polish theater and drama from the immediate postwar period to the present day - an impressively rich body of creative achievements in its most part still unknown in Brazil. For the purpose of exemplifying and examining particular aspects of the problem, two major plays still untranslated into Portuguese - Pieszo (On foot; 1980), by Slawomir Mrozek, and Pulapka (The trap; 1982), by Tadeusz Rozewicz - are analyzed and discussed in more detail.

TI The Ever-Rolling Stream: How Time Subverts "Translation for" into
   "Journeying with": Half a Century of Bible Translation in Urak Lawoi'
SO BIBLE TRANSLATOR
AB Bible translation in Urak Lawoi' began with linguistic work in the late 1960s. The Gospel of Mark was first published in 1976 and the New Testament in 1998. The Old Testament, though almost complete, was still in the checking phase in 2018. Those raw data reveal time to be one of the primary players in the drama. Time has impacted the agency of translation and its purpose, its cultural context, and even its medium. But contrary to current efficiency-based presuppositions and product-oriented drive, the result is not all bad. In the process the task has become rather a journey where the companionship is as important as the goal. This paper reflects on the exigencies of time and cultural shift over half a century of Bible translation in Urak Lawoi'.

TI Translating the literatures of stateless cultures in Spain: translation
   grants and institutional support at the Frankfurt Book Fair
SO PERSPECTIVES-STUDIES IN TRANSLATION THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB Literary translation plays a crucial role in the internationalisation of cultural and publishing markets. It constitutes a marker of status in the economic global system, therefore contributing to cultural diplomacy. As such, source-culture institutions often offer support policies to help disseminate their literatures abroad. Focusing on contemporary multilingual Spain, this paper investigates the translation policies of the Basque Country, Catalonia, Galicia and Valencia, where literature in Spanish coexists with the literatures written in the co-official languages in these regions, paying special attention to the translation grants funding schemes. Through the comprehensive study of the different stages of this funding scheme - from the design and publication of the translation grants to the allocation of funding, also including the participation of the four funding institutions at the Frankfurt Book Fair in 2018 - we combine quantitative and qualitative methods with ethnographic research to offer unique insights into the extent to which translation grants from each of the source cultures can successfully contribute to the internationalisation of literatures in these stateless cultures and less translated languages. Our research also offers revealing information about the particularities of the collaboration between institutional funding bodies and the private publishing industry in these regions.

TI Cohesion and coherence shift in Jabra's translation of Hamlet
SO ONOMAZEIN
AB This research aims at studying the cohesion and coherence shifts in Jabra's translation of Shakespeare's Hamlet in Arabic. A translator is a mediator between the source text (ST) and the target readers who expect an adequate and a coherent translation of the ST. The shift of cohesion and coherence can disrupt the continuity of the target text (TT). The sample of the research consisted of 172 lines taken from different acts and scenes involving potential problems in cohesion and coherence from Shakespeare's Hamlet, translated by Jabra Ibrahim Jabra. Blum-Kulka's approach of cohesion and coherence shifts in translation was employed as a theoretical framework. The data analysis was based on meaning shift and explicitness shift in discourse and their effects on the continuity and understanding of the TT. The study concluded that the shift of cohesion and coherence in translation does not only affect the con-tinuity of thoughts and events but disrupts the understanding of the target readers as well.

TI Anticipated Failure, or Translating Rafael Spregelburd's Plays into
   English
SO SYMPOSIUM-A QUARTERLY JOURNAL IN MODERN LITERATURES
AB Internationally regarded Argentine playwright Rafael Spregelburd has never seen a satisfying English-language production of any of his textually complex plays. Spregelburd's negative experiences highlight not only some serious obstacles to successfully staging his theatre in translation, but also several key pitfalls awaiting anyone translating Argentine theatre for Anglophone readers and audiences. Through an examination of recent productions, particularly the multiple North American stagings of La estupidez in English translation and my own ongoing collaboration with Spregelburd in translating El panico for a 2006 New York theatre festival and his latest work, Spam, for international production, I consider how the theatrical translator might respond productively to a playwright's anticipation of the failure of his plays in translation and in the process complicate translation's often-assumed unidirectionality.

TI Politics and Theatre in the PRC: Fifty Years of Teahouse on the Chinese
   Stage
SO ASIAN THEATRE JOURNAL
AB Ever since its introduction to China in the early twentieth century, spoken drama (huaju) has been at the forefront of social and political changes. Its realistic portrayal of life and use of spoken dialogue made it an ideal vehicle to promote social reforms and to serve politics. This study investigates the relationship between politics and theatre in the People's Republic of China by focusing on a masterpiece of modern Chinese drama: Lao She's play Chaguan (Teahouse, 1957), which chronicles fifty years of modern Chinese history from the demise of the Qing dynasty to the eve of the communist victory. This essay examines how historical events are portrayed, how history served as a commentary on political conditions of the 1950s, and how changing political climates have affected the productions and reception of this play. It asks whether the new critical opinions of the past few years that question the earlier politically correct interpretation might invite new ways to stage the script.

TI TESTING EXPLICITATION IN TRANSLATION: TRIANGULATING CORPUS AND
   EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES
SO ACROSS LANGUAGES AND CULTURES
AB During recent years, scholars have stressed the need to combine corpus-based translation studies (CBTS) and cognitive translatology to gain insights into the cognitive foundation for the general features of translated language (Halverson 2010; Alves and Vale 2011). This paper responds to previous calls to test explicitation phenomena on different translation modalities and types (Chesterman 2004a:47), and their cognitive basis (Halverson 2010, 2003). The paper presents a triangulation model on the basis of which hypotheses from descriptive corpus-based studies are generated, testing instruments are developed using previous corpora and the results of experimental studies are triangulated using these same corpora. The empirical study departs from two previous comparable corpus studies that focus on corporate (Jimenez-Crespo 2011a) and social networking sites (Jimenez-Crespo 2013). It uses their results and corpora to develop an experimental design to test the explicitation hypothesis. The study tests and compares explicitation on two production processes (1) translating segments directly or (2) selecting the translation from a range of valid non-translated lexical units identified in the previous study to accomplish the same communicative function. If explicitation is a general or even a universal tendency, it should be similarly present regardless of the genre, translation modality or specifics of the translation process. Although the explicitation hypothesis was confirmed in Jimenez-Crespo (2011a), the results of the present study show that the levels of explicitation vary between different production conditions, with the selection condition producing higher levels of explicitation than the regular translation condition. The results suggest procedural aspects are at play during the production stage.

TI Who's afraid of aggression Gender and impoliteness through translation
SO TRANSLATION AND TRANSLANGUAGING IN MULTILINGUAL CONTEXTS
AB Impoliteness scholars have drawn attention to the fact that any deviation from the stereotypical 'polite' and 'feminine' behaviour, in certain communities of practice, is considered impolite and offensive (Mills 2005). The aim of the study is to investigate how im/politeness constructs gender identities in two Greek stage translations (1977, 2006) of Edward Albee's Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? (1962), through analysis of how the translators reshape the im/polite behaviour in the interaction of the main couple to capture the audience's attention. An emic approach to the analysis of the two translations, along with a glimpse into multimodal aspects of interaction, namely, the body language as manifested in the film adaptation of the play (1966), indicate subversion of gender roles and different levels of aggression in the two Greek versions, highlighting the significance of the chronological distance between the two translations. The study reveals that impoliteness theories can be applicable to stage translation, that body language may be another factor contributing to the shaping of im/politeness, while there is a growing awareness that relationships and gender roles, in the sphere of the spectacle, continuously embrace aggression for entertainment purposes.

TI The role of eukaryotic initiation factor 3 in plant translation
   regulation
SO PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Regulation of translation represents a critical step in the regulation of gene expression. In plants, the translation regulation plays an important role at all stages of development and, during stress responses, functions as a fast and flexible tool which not only modulates the global translation rate but also controls the production of specific proteins. Regulation of translation is mostly focused on the initiation phase. There, one of essential initiation factors is the large multisubunit protein complex of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3). In all eukaryotes, the general eIF3 function is to scaffold the formation of the translation initiation complex and to enhance the accuracy of scanning mechanism for start codon selection. Over the past decades, additional eIF3 functions were described as necessary for development in various eukaryotic organisms, including plants. The importance of the eIF3 complex lies not only at the global level of initiation event, but also in the precise translation regulation of specific transcripts. This review gathers the available information on functions of the plant eIF3 complex.

However, close reading of the 'paratexts' of translation and their rich layers of metaphorical suggestion poses a more complex picture.. e influence of patrons, audiences, and performers forced playwrights to accept and inflect a degree of cultural hybridity in their transactions with French culture that is out of kilter with dominant historical narratives.

TI Theatre and Holy Week: The Configuration of Spanish Penitential
   Procession in the 16th Century
SO HIPOGRIFO-REVISTA DE LITERATURA Y CULTURA DEL SIGLO DE ORO
AB In the 16th century the first Spanish penitential brotherhoods were born, normally those of the Vera Cruz (True Cross) and later of the Nazarene. Their main external expression was the evening procession on Maundy Thursday or during the night to Good Friday, where from very early on stage depictions or remembrances of the Passion of Christ would appear, particularly on the way to Calvary, along with several secondary characters, such as Jews, Pharisees, Romans, etc. Following on from ancient use, the characters would cover their faces with a mask or face. Little by little, because of a certain reverential fear, the main characters, Christ and the Virgin, were eventually replaced by inanimate images. However, they continued to play their role in those sacred dramas of a folk character which were performed throughout the Peninsula, despite repeated bans from the ecclesiastical authorities. They formed a comprehensive show, a global sort of sacred performance, with an extraordinary visual, aesthetic and emotional impact. The present article therefore intends to establish a relationship between the earlier Holy Week processions and the remains of sacred theatre that have survived the continuous ecclesiastical bans.

SO ASIAN THEATRE JOURNAL
AB The conventional view of kunqu as an elite form of traditional Chinese theatre has left its legacy of live performance and the performers' efforts and creativity to keep kunqu alive onstage overlooked. Borrowing the Fan (Jieshan) provides a living and popular example of actable plays (zhezixi), plays created by performers that rework selected scenes from texts of the playwrights and turn them into stand-alone pieces that are actable, complete in themselves, and exciting to watch in performance. The translation is based upon the version shaped and performed by Wang Zhiquan and her colleagues of the Shanghai Kunqu Theatre Troupe (Shanghai Kunju Than). With her training in the female martial art role type (wudan), Wang has created a version that not only capitalizes on her virtuoso skills but also develops new and inventive ways of performing that push her and her stage partner to attain a higher level of artistic achievement and bring freshness and excitement to the stage performance of the play.

This article offers a detailed examination of the two Faust translations and the contexts in which they were produced. The 1815 translation is read against the backdrop of contemporary language learning materials whereas the 1822 translation is brought into relation with Goethe's conception of Weltliteratur as a web of textual encounters across linguistic boundaries.

TI Translation, Tradition and Intertextuality A Case Study of English
   Sankranti
SO ORBIS LITTERARUM
AB Behind the making of a great work, in any language, there is a significant contribution from intertextual elements. Textual dialectics - a result of the interplay of multiple texts within a text - plays a major role in converting an otherwise ordinary work into a canonical work. It is in this sense that Eliot wrote that appreciation of any art is invariably an appreciation of the entire artistic tradition in which the new art is situated. When a translator chooses to translate such works in which there is a rich interplay of intertextual elements, he is invariably left with no better option than to bring in these elements, lest he should run the risk of reducing classics to works of mediocrity. In this process of translating intertextual elements, what problems does a translator encounter and what strategies does he adopt to overcome them? This paper attempts to explore the intricate and organic relationship that exists between translation, tradition and intertextuality against the backdrop of my English translation of Sankranti, a classic Kannada play written by P. Lankesh, one of the gifted writers of the Kannada world.

SO TRANSLATION AND TRANSLANGUAGING IN MULTILINGUAL CONTEXTS
AB This study intends (a) to heighten awareness of how impoliteness scholarship may enlighten translation research and practice, and (b) to broaden the scope of research in impoliteness studies by considering stage translation data. It examines Tennessee Williams' play The Glass Menagerie ([1944] 2018) and two of its Greek translated versions (by Nikos Spanias, 1946/1987, Gamma upsilon alpha lambda iota nu omicron sigma Kappa o sigma mu omicron sigma [Glass World] and by Errikos Belies, 2001/2014, & Omicron Gamma upsilon alpha lambda iota nu omicron sigma Kappa o sigma mu omicron sigma [The Glass World]). It attempts an intra-cultural comparison of the two translations to examine how translators rendered impoliteness in family interaction, taking into account their chronological gap. The study takes an emic perspective to the data, designs a questionnaire eliciting respondents' evaluation of impolite options and uses Garcia-Pastor's (2008) model of face-aggravating strategies to account for the findings. Findings show that the second translation conveys the conflict between the main characters in more concrete terms, exploiting more face-aggravating strategies in relation to the first translation. The study also shows that the respondents seem to favour more impolite renderings by considering the characters' intimate relationships, confirming the connection between intimacy and impoliteness. The significance of the research lies in the fact that it broadens the scope of (im)politeness theory and studies to include another field that could provide data for the research of such instances of interaction, namely translation studies and in that it shows the validity of pragmatics in enlightening translation practice.

TI LANGUAGE, TRANSLATION, AND THE IRISH THEATRE DIASPORA IN QUEBEC
SO ILHA DO DESTERRO-A JOURNAL OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE LITERATURES IN ENGLISH
   AND CULTURAL STUDIES
AB This article argues for the inclusion of Quebecois translations of Irish plays as part of the Irish theatrical diaspora. The presence of an Irish diaspora in North America was mainly the result of massive waves of immigration, in large part due to the Great Famine, peaking during the mid-nineteenth century before gradually abating. This diaspora was integrated into Quebec society, undoubtedly facilitated by similar political, religious, and even linguistic elements. Interest in Irish culture, especially in its theatrical output, remains high, with many theatre companies, for example Theatre La Licorne in Montreal, in the province commissioning seasons based on Celtic Tiger-era dramas, translated by Quebecois playwrights. In tracing the reason for this interest, despite diminished recent immigration, this article provides the basis for continued research into the performative force of proactive translations across varying diasporic traditions.

TI A Feminist Perspective to Nora-A Doll's House
SO LITERA-JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE LITERATURE AND CULTURE STUDIES
AB The sociology of translation provides a methodology which enables the researcher to focus on the agents who produce a translation product and their position-taking in the field by considering the interrelationships between the "field; "habitus" and "capitals" The approach adopted in the sociology of translation has been substantially shaped by the sociological concepts developed by Pierre Bourdieu. Habitus, which is one of the most important concepts in this respect, provides an important tool to researchers in terms of studying the agents and their roles in the field. This study examines the influence of the translational agents on the circulation of women-centred plays with a feminist perspective. Since theatre is a performing art which brings linguistic and non-linguistic elements together, drama translation also requires many points such as performability, speakability and playability to betaken into account which go beyond the textual and linguistic concerns. Considering this, it is possible to say that a drama translator with a "habitue' structured in the field of theatre will inevitably have an effect on the translation product. Hence, departing from this supposition, the study concentrates on Jale Karabekir's "professional habitus" through the example of Nora-A Doll's House by Henrik Ibsen. Nora-A Dolt House, which universally questions gender roles, has been translated by different translation agents in Turkey before; however it has been constructed with a feminist dramaturgy for the first time by the founder and general art director of Tiyatro Boyali Ku; Karabekir. Karabekir has also made the play available to a larger number of women audiences thanks to the performance carried out in different cities in Turkey.

TI Reiteration: at the intersection of code-switching and translation
SO MULTILINGUA-JOURNAL OF CROSS-CULTURAL AND INTERLANGUAGE COMMUNICATION
AB One of the most studied forms of multilingual language use is code-switching, the use of more than one language within a speech exchange. Some forms of code-switching may also be regarded as instances of translation, but the relation between these notions in studies of multilingual discourse remains underspecified. The present article examines the intersection of code-switching and translation by exploring multilingual reiteration, the phenomenon most clearly intertwined with both code-switching and translation. We reflect on the analytical treatment of reiterations as occasions of code-switching and/or translation by reviewing the use of related terms in previous studies and by examining two sets of data. We analyze multilingual contemporary conversations and early modern drama by employing two separate functional approaches: conversation analysis/interactional linguistics and pragmaphilology/historical socio-pragmatics. Instead of viewing reiteration primarily as a type of code-switching or translation, this study considers it more broadly as an act of repetition, with each case possessing its individual, context-sensitive properties. In particular, the study investigates multilingual reiteration from the point of view of the organizational features of repetition within the larger context of action and discourse.

TI Formal and Informal Address in the Slovene Translations of Albee's Play
   Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
SO PRIMERJALNA KNJIZEVNOST
AB Translation of T-forms and V-forms from English into Slovene represents a considerable translation problem, the nature of which is mainly stylistic. Unlike in Slovene, there is no linguistic distinction of this kind in modern English, which means that the difference between the two forms in the Slovene text must be introduced by the translator, even in cases when the source text provides no clear information on the degree of formality or politeness that will necessarily be conveyed through the use of one or the other address form in the source text. In literary translation, this issue is most relevant in drama, which by its very nature contains many direct addresses. The choice to use one or the other form in the utterances of dramatic characters is often very complex, since it affects not only the tone of the discourse (and thus the speaker's register, as defined by Hatim and Mason (50)), but also at least two key elements of the dramatic structure: the characterization of dramatic characters and relationships between them.
   The discussion provides several theoretical views on second person address (T-forms / V-forms) in stylistics, and briefly summarizes the historical development (and gradual abandonment) of the distinction between the two forms in Old and Middle English, as well as highlighting the problem in the translation of this language element in languages that still use this distinction today. The final part of the article analyzes the use of the T-form / V-form distinction in two Slovene translations of Albee's play Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and assesses how well the translators make use of the opportunities offered by a linguistic and stylistic phenomenon nonexistent in the original language.

TI Sweeney Agonistes in noh mask: T. S. Eliot, Japanese noh, and the
   fragments of world drama
SO NEOHELICON
AB The expansive reach of the ancient Japanese noh theater as it influenced modernist performance and poetics took in T. S. Eliot as well as Ezra Pound and W. B. Yeats, the more commonly recognized noh aficionados. Pound and Eliot attended the premiere of Yeats's noh-inspired retelling of Irish legend, At the Hawk's Well, in 1916. This essay considers the influence of that production on Eliot's later work, discussing his review of Pound's translations of noh plays based on drafts by Ernest Fenollosa and focusing on two productions of Eliot's dramatic fragment Sweeney Agonistes. Incorporating influences from noh, classical tragedy, and American minstrel performance, among others, Sweeney Agonistes is an example of world drama. But, Eliot's play is best served by a definition of world drama that does not oppose national theatrical traditions, one that recognizes the emergence of world drama from a critical practice that focuses on global allusion and inspirations and the transnational exchange of performance ideas and techniques.

TI Characters' Speech in Fiction: Translation Methods
SO NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
AB In this article the author discusses the questions raised during the international conference "Books with Conversations: How to Translate Characters' Speech" (Moscow, Higher School of Economics, Lomonosov Moscow State University). The conference program was focused on the problem of translation of various speech forms (dialogue, monologue, attribution, role speech, etc.) in different linguistic traditions: leading world researchers and translators (English, German, Japanese, Scandinavian languages) attempted to problematize a given topic in various aspects, both theoretical and practical, and methodological. The researchers discussed the problem of translating direct speech both in modern literature and in classic literature, which in some cases requires the "aging" of the language. In addition, the speakers referred to the comparison of the translation of characters' speech in adult fiction, in teen fiction, and in children's fiction, involving parent-child joint reading. Another aspect of translation, highlighted during the discussion at the conference, was the question of yakuwarigo, i.e. fictionalised orality in Japanese fiction, a type of role speech, often used in literary works written in Japanese. This type of speech often depicts such features of character as gender, age, occupation, class etc. The researchers and translators drew attention to the perception of the text: whether it will be perceived visually or audibly, whether it will be read or heard, it focuses on writing (prose) or audial dimension (drama, audiobooks, etc.). Particular attention was paid to the receptive dimension of translation: a promising direction for discussion in this case is to put it into an intermedial context, the characters' speech can adapt to the media in which it is reproduced, and require, as a result, different principles of translation.

   AND PHILOSOPHY OF LITERATURE
AB Fuente Ovejuna, one of the most famous Lope de Vega's dramas, was composed between 1612 and 1614 and represented, after a two centuries oblivion, a fulcrum of the revolutionary theatre of 1800. The historical frame is the insurrection in 1476 of the little village of Fuente Ovejuna against the Comendador Fernan Gomez, a repressive feudatory that oppressed the population with excessive duties. The thwarted wedding of Frondoso and Laurencia is the internal narration with the end known by the most. In 1994 the choreographer and dancer Antonio Gades stages in Europe his own version of the drama, mix of music, singing, dance and acting. In this article will analyze intersemiotic translation and transmutation of the different languages from the lopescian drama to the new theatrical-musical representation.

TI Unspoken Indigenous History on the Stage: The Postcolonial Plays of Jack
   Davis
SO NEW THEATRE QUARTERLY
AB Literary scholars and linguists have argued extensively that language is not simply a purely representational vehicle of thought but its determining medium, whose ordering powers not only shape cognizance of reality but are also actively involved in processes of imperialism and cultural erasure. It is the determinative yet slippery quality of language, prompting the loss of meaning in attempts at translation, that colonial powers manipulated to violent effect and which, as enacted in the plays of Nyoongah Indigenous Australian playwright Jack Davis, continue to haunt history and the present. This article considers how a history and culture made unspeakable by colonialism through the erasure of Indigenous Australian oral traditions, languages, and historical perspectives is translated on to the Anglophone stage in the plays of Davis, one of the first Indigenous playwrights to be published and performed internationally, and how this was received by the witnessing audience. Davis achieves this theatrical translation not only through the negotiation and manipulation of colonial language and verbatim history alongside Indigenous languages, enacting a kind of linguistic double consciousness, but also through physical theatre and dance. The latter are the central means of communicating meaning and knowledge in Nyoongah culture. Jacqueline M. Brown is a graduate student at Worcester College, University of Oxford, studying for a Master of Studies in English (1900-present). This article received first prize in the 2022 TORCH Reimagining Performance Network Graduate Essay Prize competition run in collaboration between the University of Oxford and New Theatre Quarterly.

TI THEATER TRANSLATION INTO SIGN LANGUAGES: AN ESSAY ON THE BODY AND
   (IN)VISIBILITY
SO CADERNOS DE TRADUCAO
AB In the present essay. we propose a discussion based on a concern that part of the population, the deaf community, does not have access (or very little and in a non-aesthetical way) to the theatrical plays produced by the majority community, the listeners. Amongst the different questions involved in this situation, we propose a discussion about the (in)visibility of translation and the Sign Languages (SL) translator/interpreter's visible body - visible because it is present (or present because it is visible) - in the scene (or on its fringe). Of course these questions are related, as they are implicated in one another, but they allow us to see in a particular way a theme that is very dear to Translation Studies: the translation process (in)visibility. Therefore, we seek an aesthetical experience (the theatrical play), based on a po-ethic approach to translation, rather than just prioritizing a translation that "communicates the message". The meaning here is not discovered, but created, built, invented. The theatre translation into SLs is conceived here as a visual, spatial and linguistic act, and it must be designed according to the play specificities. Thus, our goal is proposing a theater translation/interpreting process into SLs, in dialogue with the stage direction.

AB Russian and Soviet history of translation has undergone different stages of its development. Western literature in Russian translation played a significant role in forming the national literature (the so-called literary transplantation of the 18th century). Later, not only selection, but also non-selection of books/authors for translation played a canon-forming function. Social (historical, political, ideological) influence on translation was of a shifting nature, as it is shown by examples (such as Jane Austen). It also affected the process of selection/non-selection of books for translation.

We aim at highlighting the way in which the graduation paper in Translation Studies can become an excellent opportunity to encourage students to test the applicability of key concepts from this field and to tackle research systematically. Based on our experience of supervising graduation papers on translation studies-related topics, we have identified students' typical approaches and recurring difficulties. This allows us to suggest possible solutions for the problems encountered, depending on each stage of the process. Our purpose as supervisors is to endow students with the cognitive flexibility they need in order to draw up an adequate research plan, use translation assessment criteria creatively and hone their critical skills for future real-life situations.

TI Cultural Adaptation of the Spanish Version of the Perceptions of Play
   Scale
SO JOURNAL OF CHILD AND FAMILY STUDIES
AB Objective Play is crucial for healthy child development; yet, the time dedicated to free play during the pre-school years has decreased in both school and home environments. Parental beliefs influence the activities in which children engage in daily life; therefore, exploring these beliefs is a first step to understand possible reasons for the decreased frequency of free play. Instruments developed for this purpose are scarce and, to date, none of them is available in Spanish. We adapted and assessed the psychometric properties of the Perceptions of Play Scale (PPS) and developed the Spanish version of the instrument (i.e., PPS-S). Method We followed Beaton and colleagues' Guidelines for the cross-cultural adaptation of self-report measures, which describes two stages, namely translation and adaptation of the instrument, and assessment of its psychometric properties. During the first stage, a panel of 5 experts developed the preliminary version of the PPS-S. This version of the scale was piloted in a sample of 28 early childhood educators and parents of preschool children, whose feedback informed the development of the final version of the instrument. During the second stage, 452 parents of pre-school children completed the PPS-S to assess its psychometric properties. Results An Exploratory Factor analysis showed high to excellent reliabilities for the three PPS-S subscales and the complete questionnaire. The PPS-S is a valuable, culturally sensitive tool for exploring parental beliefs about three aspects of play (i.e., frequency, playful character, and academic contribution) and could contribute to studies to promote this activity in Chilean children.

TI ANGER, FAITH AND BEWILDERED FRAGMENTS OF SELF: THE SHAPING OF ETHOS IN
   AN ARGENTINEAN TRANSLATION OF SARAH KANE?S 4.48 PSYCHOSIS
SO CADERNOS DE TRADUCAO
AB 4.48 Psychosis1 is British playwright Sarah Kane's final play. Its opening took place at the Royal Court Theatre Upstairs in London in June 2000, only a few months after Kane's suicide. The initial reception of the play was surrounded by controversy in the United Kingdom, with some reviewers and critics interpreting the theatrical text as primarily autobiographical. Informed by a socio-discursive perspective, which specifically looks at the construction of ethos, this paper aims at contributing to the study of subjectivity in translated drama. Focusing on Rafael Spregelburd's Argentinean Spanish translation of 4.48 Psychosis, published by Losada in 2006, we explore the shaping of subjectivity in the translated dramatic text highlighting the way in which the persona of the translator builds within and beyond the translated text. While Spregelburd's translation uses dramatic strategies and techniques that successfully foster the image or ethos of a rupturist playwright, it still stresses the autobiographical character often attributed to the text. This is particularly evident in the female gender construction of the main voice in the play, which is ambiguous in the source text. Assessed within the framework of Spregelburd's whole production, our analysis also explores the construction of the translator's persona and positioning in the target dramatic text and system.

TI The translator's visibility: Detecting translatorial fingerprints in
   contemporaneous parallel translations
SO COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE
AB We detail the results of experiments towards a fine-grained stylometric analysis, the identification of distinguishing features between contemporaneous literary translations, both parallel works and also translations of non-parallel sets of works by the same author. We examine translations of plays by the Norwegian dramatist Henrik Ibsen with the initial point of focus being the Ibsen drama Ghosts, for which there exists comparable contemporaneous translations by R. Farqhuarson Sharp and William Archer. Consequently, a number of prose translations of Russian author Anton Chekhov by Marian Fell and Constance Garnett are examined in order to validate hypotheses formed from the results of the Ibsen study and investigate possible particularities in translator' s style which may vary according to genre.
   By carrying out an analysis of these texts using a variety of machine learning approaches such as Support Vector Machines, Simple Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and Decision Tree classifiers, a number of distinguishing textual features are obtained, and the relative frequency of these features in the texts are compared to their frequencies in reference corpora in order to establish which features can be attributed to stylistic choices by the translators themselves and which features may be due to influence from the source language or the topic or genre of a text. We also use the popular Delta metric from authorship attribution studies to investigate the clustering of texts based on most frequent words and a list of discriminatory terms learned in the supervised machine learning experiments.
   We find that common word unigrams and bigrams are the most salient features for translator fingerprinting across our two authors and four translators examined and are ultimately successful in our goal of classifying which text originated from a particular translator with accuracy measurements of over 90% on average.

TI Tonight We Adapt: Investigating the Adaptive Nature of the Theatrical
   Experience Through a Case Study of a Production of Pirandello's Tonight
   We Improvise (Questa sera si recita a soggetto)
SO ROMANCE STUDIES
AB Re-narrations, re-interpretations and adaptations of inherited texts and stories are crucial mechanisms through which human beings receive and create meaning. Theatre is particularly interesting in this sense, as it is an art form that inherently implies collective creation through the involvement of at the very least one performer and one spectator. The staging of a play exemplifies and makes apparent the more general truth that any encounter with a text, in the broadest sense of the word, is in fact an act of appropriation. Pirandello's plays constitute a highly relevant instance, because it has been argued that the meta-theatrical discourse of his 'teatro nel teatro' trilogy is inevitably out of date because of its inherent historical relativity. Successful productions of Pirandello's plays, therefore, need to include reflections on their meta-theatrical discourse and to appropriate such discourse so that it is meaningful to a new linguistic, historical, geographical and cultural context; in other words, Pirandello's plays intrinsically need to be adapted. This paper reflects on the problematic adaptive thrust of Pirandello's theatre through the case study of a specific production of Questa sera si recita a soggetto in English under its English title of Tonight We Improvise staged in Providence (RI, USA) in Spring 2014.

TI Doubly invisible: Anna Larpent, domestic censorship, and the translation

SO TRANSLATION STUDIES
AB Drawing on censored manuscripts and personal writing, the article uncovers the invisible role played by Anna Larpent, the wife of John Larpent (Royal Theatre Censor 1777-1824), in shaping foreign drama and opera in Georgian Britain. Anna's journals demonstrate that, as a more attentive theatregoer and critic than her husband, she took on many aspects of the role of reviser and curator of the submitted plays and became an important mediator between European performance cultures and Georgian audiences. The article explores the complex and contradictory role played by Larpent as an "agent of translation" selecting and censoring European performance cultures throughout this period and introduces the notion of "domestic censorship" to give visibility to the labour and agency of women. In doing so, it highlights the value of archives of life writing in providing empirical evidence of the wide range of agents involved in shaping the translation of performance cultures.

TI Shakespeare's Influence on Pre-Independence Assamese Tragedy: a
   Historical Perspective
SO RUPKATHA JOURNAL ON INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES IN HUMANITIES
AB In Assamese, the tradition of writing and production of plays on the model of Sankardeva, Madhavdeva and their contemporaries fell into decadence with the arrival of a new type of plays under the influence of Shakespearean dramas. The presence of Shakespeare is deeply felt as close translations of his texts are being done and his style and technique being freely adopted. Some of these Assamese plays have nothing authentically Shakespearean about them but they could not have been written in the first place but for Shakespeare's influence on their writers. Shakespeare is thus the main creative force behind this entire body of dramatic literature in Assamese. Since the late 19th century productions of Shakespearean plays by different writers and his influence on Assamese drama has continued unabated even to this day. In this article, an attempt has been made to selectively focus on pre-Independence Assamese tragedy. It discusses how Assamese drama in general and tragedy in particular, has developed in the light of Shakespeare's tragic vision.

TI Towards a plurilingual development paradigm: from spontaneous to

SO INTERPRETER AND TRANSLATOR TRAINER
AB This paper explores the role played by translation in additional language learning (ALL) as a particular example of translation in other learning contexts (TOLC), i.e. translation as used in educational contexts other than translation studies. The project presented in this paper draws on research and good practice in translation studies, pedagogy, educational psychology and language acquisition and is framed within a plurilingual development paradigm. The theoretical framework questions a monolingual approach to ALL and considers educational objectives, learning strategies, translation competence, multi-competence, the Dynamic Model of Multilingualism, plurilingualism and the Interdependence Hypothesis to favour the connected development of linguistic and mediation skills. The pedagogy adopts a humanistic approach to teaching, teaching for transfer and (socio)constructivism. The paper reports on the second of an ongoing three-stage study involving 45 undergraduate students. In the first stage, the spontaneous use of translation was recorded to identify critical instances of its use in ALL. In the second, data regarding the teacher's and students' perceptions and uses of translation were gathered. Following on from the findings of this research, learning material is currently being designed with a view to including translation in additional language learning in an explicit way.

TI Reflections on the relational in translation as mediated interaction
SO JOURNAL OF PRAGMATICS
AB The study attempts to broaden the conceptualization of the relational to include stage translation situations. It uses translator trainees' evaluations (as the hearers' view) to assess rendition of im/polite exchanges in three retranslations of a twentieth century English play. Findings showthat translator trainees' evaluations of the way intimacy and offensiveness values are rendered in the three target versions of the play are a function of trainees' level of awareness with respect to the relational dynamics between characters in the play. Translator trainees seem to increasingly prefer heightened intimacy (connectedness) and offensiveness (separateness), as they become aware of the relational dynamics in the play. Translator trainees (native speakers of the target language) seem to appreciate instances manifesting the politeness orientation attributed to the target language (Sifianou, 1992), while awareness of the relational dynamics in the play seems to override the importance of polarity orientation concerns. Translation is claimed to be able to provide settings where the relational and the cognitive may be fruitfully researched. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI SAGARRA SAGARREJA? A LINGUISTIC ANALYSIS OF JOSEP M. DE SAGARRA'S
   TRANSLATION OF MACBETH
SO CAPLLETRA
AB The translations of Shakespeare's plays by Josep M. de Sagarra marked a turning point regarding the previous translations of Shakespeare's works into Catalan. This was mainly due to the number of translated plays (twenty-eight) and the fact that these translations were meant to be performed on stage. This paper reviews the main critical comments about Sagarra's translations of Shakespeare's plays. One of them is that some options in Sagarra's texts sagarregen, that is, they contain more of Sagarra's style than Shakespeare's. The aim of this article is to refine the concept of sagarrejar and to identify the main characteristics of Sagarra's way of translating Shakespeare. To do so, key linguistic aspects of his translation of Macbeth have been analysed: register, intensification, preferential words, addition and deletion of information, total changes of meaning and metre.

TI ANTON CHEKHOV'S NOVELLA THE STEPPE IN ENGLISH TRANSLATIONS
SO TEKST KNIGA KNIGOIZDANIE-TEXT BOOK PUBLISHING
AB Chekhov's works have been actively translated into English for 130 years; however, these translations have scarcely been addressed systematically and remain understudied. This is especially relevant in case of his stories and novellas. This article focuses on the translations of Chekhov's The Steppe - a novella that marked the writer's transition from early stories to mature prose. The 20th and 21st centuries have seen five English translations of The Steppe, which mark five main stages of its reception. The novella was first introduced to the English-speaking reader by E.L. Kaye in 1916. Though highly criticized for literalism and unsuccessful methods of translating Russian realia, Kaye's translation played an important role in the development of the creative dialogue between Chekhov and K. Mansfield, which clearly reflected the influence of Chekhov's prose on the formation of modern English literature. The canonical translations by C. Garnett determined Chekhov's reception in England and the United States from the 1920s to the 1950s. The translator introduced Chekhov to the English-speaking reader as an artist of Russian life, a master in depicting various types of characters, and as a thorough researcher of a person's inner world. This vision determined a specific perspective in the 1919 translation of The Steppe, where Father Christopher is foregrounded as a collective image of the Russian clergy. In the new stage of perception in the 1970s-1980s, Chekhov, a foreign writer, was organically accepted by the English-speaking culture as "its own". This stage brought about the translation of The Steppe by R. Hingley, who authored two monographs about Chekhov and was the editor of The Oxford Chekhov (1964-1980). Hingley considered Chekhov's mature prose as the most valuable part of the writer's literary legacy. For the first time, The Oxford Chekhov adequately describes The Steppe as Chekhov's landmark work. The strategy of cultural appropriation in Hingley's translation implied modernization of Chekhov's language. The translations by R. Wilkes (2001) and R. Pevear and L. Volokhonsky (2004) represent the latest stage in the English-language reception of The Steppe. They are associated with the general trend towards updating the corpus of translations of Russian classics into English in the 2000s. In their translation, Pevear and Volokhonsky use the strategy of estrangement, opposed to "smooth" translation, typical for English culture. The translators' interest in the novella resulted from Chekhov's genre innovation. All the translations of The Steppe are independent representations of the original, which demonstrate the productive reception of the novella in the English-language culture of the 20th and 21st centuries. Their comparative analysis has revealed that the biggest challenge in translation is the image of the steppe, which is associated with the main philosophical meanings of the work. This is evidenced by the significant transformations of the motifs of space and distance, which form the spatial dominant of the image in the original. In most translations, the semantically integral motifs of the original break into a number of components with weaker meanings. The research has shown that these transformations come from objective cultural and linguistic differences that limit the possibilities of a full-fledged translation, as well as from individual strategies of translators, who differently assess the role and meaning of these verbal motifs in the original text.

TI Stages of the Loss, Translation as Contamination: How The Ritual Made It
   to the Royal National Theatre, London
SO THEATRE RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB This article focuses on the practice of translating Brazilian playwright Samir Yazbek's play The Ritual for the Royal National Theatre, as part of its 2012 Connections season. The article charts the course of the translation through its different stages, and through the different drafts of the play as they emerged, and examines the way in which translation itself can become a mediator for dramaturgical support, development, enquiry and critique. Through an interrogation not only of what is retained by the playwright, but also of what ultimately falls by the wayside, what is lost, I examine the peculiarly British notion of 'workshopping' new writing, in its linguistic mediated form of translation, and the role of the translator as cultural mediator. Ultimately, the article points towards an international economy of playwriting products where translation becomes a means of mediating cultures through particular and specific frames that remain largely unchallenged.

TI "Un 'Pygmalion' quebecois: une victoire": Eloi de Grandmont's
   Translation of Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion
SO SHAW-THE JOURNAL OF BERNARD SHAW STUDIES
AB Eloi de Grandmont's 1968 translation of Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion, staged by Theatre du Nouveau Monde in their 1968-69 season, featured dialogue in standard French as well as joual, paralleling Shaw's dichotomy between Cockney and Standard English from the 1941 source text, and also reterritorialized London's environs to Montreal. Grandmont's translation of Pygmalion highlights translation as creative and productive, rather than derivative and secondary, work because it reconstructs and reterritorializes, rather than mimics, a Shavian Montreal. Adapting the original play demonstrates how language influences and constructs identity through the layering of various other linguistic and cultural constructions. This article therefore demonstrates the impact of Grandmont's proactive translation of Shaw's Pygmalion, serving to inspire later sociopolitically proactive translations in Quebec, and analyzes how the translator foregrounds Quebecois identity during the formative period of La Revolution Tranquille.

TI Adaptation of Shakespeare's Plays into Assamese Farce: A Study on
   Historical Perspective
SO RUPKATHA JOURNAL ON INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES IN HUMANITIES
AB William Shakespeare has always been unanimously the most accepted model to follow for the writers of tragedy, comedy and other types of dramas. He enjoyed a great fascination in the latter half of the nineteenth century and the first few decades of the twentieth in India and almost all his works were translated to or adapted into different languages. As the Assamese writers did not lag behind in this respect too, they were inspired to translate and adapt Shakespeare in 1887 starting with The Comedy of Errors as Bhramaranga in Assamese. In this article, the researcher aims to examine the available Assamese translations and adaptations of Shakespearean comic plays and studied how far they contributed to the growth and development of Assamese comedy in particular and modern Assamese drama in general. With the help of the comparative method of analysis, the researcher found that Assamese comedy specially farces and the complete pre-independent Assamese dramatic literature have been impacted by the dramas of Shakespeare.

TI The Dynamic Regulation of mRNA Translation and Ribosome Biogenesis
   During Germ Cell Development and Reproductive Aging
SO FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB The regulation of mRNA translation, both globally and at the level of individual transcripts, plays a central role in the development and function of germ cells across species. Genetic studies using flies, worms, zebrafish and mice have highlighted the importance of specific RNA binding proteins in driving various aspects of germ cell formation and function. Many of these mRNA binding proteins, including Pumilio, Nanos, Vasa and Dazl have been conserved through evolution, specifically mark germ cells, and carry out similar functions across species. These proteins typically influence mRNA translation by binding to specific elements within the 3 ' untranslated region (UTR) of target messages. Emerging evidence indicates that the global regulation of mRNA translation also plays an important role in germ cell development. For example, ribosome biogenesis is often regulated in a stage specific manner during gametogenesis. Moreover, oocytes need to produce and store a sufficient number of ribosomes to support the development of the early embryo until the initiation of zygotic transcription. Accumulating evidence indicates that disruption of mRNA translation regulatory mechanisms likely contributes to infertility and reproductive aging in humans. These findings highlight the importance of gaining further insights into the mechanisms that control mRNA translation within germ cells. Future work in this area will likely have important impacts beyond germ cell biology.

AB Where the barbarians live is staged by the Chilean company Bonobo, which approaches the way the violence of human relations is normalized and understood today and how the archetype of the enemy is configured, which always accompanies the history of peoples and civilizations. The play tells the story of three cousins who, after several years without seeing each other, decide to meet in Chile in 2015. The host, Roberto, director of a famous NGO, finds himself involved in the strange murder of a young woman. This unleashes a series of revelations and unexpected attitudes of the characters, which will sharpen the conflicts and ideas that each one built around the other: the enemy.

But his translation of Gotz von Berlichingen shows that Scott emphasizes the commonalities between German and British culture: in foregrounding the influence of Shakespeare on Goethe and drawing analogies between German and British historical customs, Scott points his readers towards the familiarity of the foreign culture. Following in Lessing's footsteps, Scott uses cultural similarity in dramatic texts to encourage appreciation for another culture and promote the development of his own.

TI Murine PAIP1 stimulates translation of spermiogenic mRNAs stored by YBX2
   via its interaction with YBX2
SO BIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION
AB The expression of many genes during the postmeiotic stages of spermatogenesis is largely regulated by germ cell-specific RNA-binding proteins at the level of posttranscription. One of these RNA-binding proteins, YBX2, participates in mRNA storage and regulation of translation in haploid spermatids. How YBX2-stored mRNAs become translationally competent during spermiogenesis remains unknown. In the present study, we report for the first time that YBX2 interacts with PAIP1, a protein translation enhancer, in vitro and in vivo. In murine testes, PAIP1 is highly expressed and colocalizes with YBX2 in round spermatids. Using sequential RNA immunoprecipitation and sequence analysis, we identified a group of spermiogenic mRNAs indirectly bound by PAIP1 through YBX2. Translation of mRNAs bearing the YBX2 target sequence was significantly blocked by YBX2 protein, but was reinitiated when YBX2 was coexpressed with PAIP1 in vitro. Taken together, these results indicate that PAIP1 regulates the translation of YBX2-masked mRNAs during spermiogenesis, and we propose this YBX2-PAIP1 interaction plays an important role in male germ cell development.
   PAIP1 interacts with YBX2 in the testis and stimulates translation of spermiogenic mRNAs stored by YBX2.

TI Presentation and positioning in Van Wyk Louw: 'n Lewensverhaal ("Van Wyk
   Louw: A life story") by JC Steyn
SO TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE
AB In this article, I attempta critical reading of Steyn's widely acclaimed biography (1998, named above) by using diverse critical frameworks and theories. In accordance with views advanced in narratology, writing a historical narrative is seen as a venture that cannot escape subjectivity, despite the historicist's being bound by factual writing and oral accounts of chronicles and facts. In a previous study (Van Coller 2019a), history-writing has been compared with the process of translation because the historian also has to choose between two modes of presentation, namely foreignisation and domestication (Venutti 1995). The present study, however, focuses on another influential and important translation theory, namely the skopos theory, propounded by the German scholar Christiane Nord (1991; 2006). According to this theory, translation is function-driven and the translator has no free play in translation. The translator is bound by "loyalty" - loyalty towards the initiator who commissioned or assigned the translation (the translation brief), the target audience and the source text. It follows that any strategic choices exercised are closely related to the needs (values and knowledge) of the target audience. These insights apply mutatis mutandis to the biographer, who has the same loyalty to the initiator, his target readers and, particularly, the subject of his biography. In a recent study (Van Coller 2019b), I also reviewed Steyn's biographies of Piet Cillie, former newspaper editor (of Die Burger) and influential political analyst, and MER (Miemie Rothman), an Afrikaans journalist, writer and member of the Carnegie commission of inquiry (1929-1932) into extreme poverty among white people. The conclusion in that study was that although both biographies can be regarded as thorough, the presentation of especially Piet Cillie was skewed because key aspects of his life have been manipulated in the sense that many of his obvious shortcomings were underplayed or treated in a manner to present him in a more positive light. This could perhaps be ascribed to the fact that the Cillie biography was commissioned by Naspers (which, at the time, also paid Steyn's salary, while Cillie was one of the pivotal figures in the organisation). Likewise, MER also had close ties with Naspers. In the present study, one of the findings is that Truida Louw, widow of NP van Wyk Louw, apparently strongly influenced the Van Wyk Louw biography as she reportedly favoured Steyn as the biographer (and may therefore be viewed as co-initiator) and that she (as well as her children, Reinet and Peter) granted Steyn interviews and even had access to the biography at the manuscript stage. This involvement of the Louw family without a doubt had a bearing on the final, published version: quite a few cuts had been made in the manuscript, almost all of them aimed at improving the posture (Meizoz 2010) of Louw or Truida, although it cannot be categorically stated that all of these changes resulted from their comments. One of the most important findings of this study is that while Louw, in the main, has been represented by Steyn - notwithstanding his obvious admiration for Louw - "warts and all", the representation of other key players in this "drama" has been manipulated. The posture of Truida - in accordance with positioning theory - is extremely positive (both with reference to her illicit affair with Louw from 1936 to 1938, and during his extramarital affair with Sheila Cussons from 1950 to 1956 in Amsterdam).
   However, Steyn does not portray Cussons, who declined point-blank to contribute to this biography, very sympathetically. After the publication of this two-part biography, Cussons responded and refuted several claims made in the biography, particularly the assumption that her relationship with Louw had been merely a fleeting affair. According to her, it was a serious love relationship and even more profoundly a poetic one. In the interview concerned, some of the most important poems in Louw's last published volume of poems were mentioned, all of them directly related to their relationship: dedicated to Cussons, alluding to the relationship or resulting directly from their poetic interaction and cooperation. In conclusion, it can be argued that although Steyn's biography is undoubtedly a beacon in biographical writing in Afrikaans, not even this scientific and comprehensive study can lay claim to absolute objectivity. The writing of any historical account is a hermeneutical endeavour, therefore always prone to subjective elements.

TI Beyond Interlingual Translation: Transforming History, Corporeality, and

SO ADAPTATION-THE JOURNAL OF LITERATURE ON SCREEN STUDIES
AB Building mostly on the seminal works of Andre Lefevere and Bassnett, recent work carried out in translation studies has problematized extant conceptions of translation and the distinction between various forms of creative rewritings. Similarly, individual scholars such as Katja Krebs and Laurence Raw in the field of adaptation studies have illuminated points of convergence and overlap between translation and adaptation. This article espouses and extends existing studies by explicating the redundancy of the borders constructed between translation and adaptation within the broader framework of Nigerian theatre and performance. Informed by a transdisciplinary approach adapted from multimodal social semiotics and literary studies, the author engages in analysis and close-readings of the play text and stage performance of Femi Osofisan's Women of Owu (2004/2006) to investigate how translation transcends simple interlingual practice to encompass adaptations of the spatial, temporal and embodied aspects of societies and cultures.

TI SHIFTING GENRES: RENDERING BAD LANGUAGE IN THE POLISH VOICE-OVER OF THE

SO POZNAN STUDIES IN CONTEMPORARY LINGUISTICS
AB This article is devoted to the problem of translating bad language in cases when the target audience recipient has direct access to the source text and the impact translational and editorial choices have on the overall meaning of the work. As an illustration of this point, it discusses a voice-over translation, in which case it is common practice to censor vulgarities, mainly by means of under-translating certain phrases, which are considered taboo, or omitting them completely. Such choices are justified for a number of reasons, including protecting vulnerable audiences or reducing semantic density because most taboo words exercise a phatic function. However, in certain cases censoring bad language has an impact on the semiotic make-up of the work and thus, changes the meaning intended by the original author. A good illustration is provided with the analysis of particular scenes from the Canadian drama American Heist.

TI Ribosome profiling reveals translation control as a key mechanism
   generating differential gene expression in Trypanosoma cruzi
SO BMC GENOMICS
AB Background: Due to the absence of transcription initiation regulation of protein coding genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II, posttranscriptional regulation is responsible for the majority of gene expression changes in trypanosomatids. Therefore, cataloging the abundance of mRNAs (transcriptome) and the level of their translation (translatome) is a key step to understand control of gene expression in these organisms.
   Results: Here we assess the extent of regulation of the transcriptome and the translatome in the Chagas disease causing agent, Trypanosoma cruzi, in both the non-infective (epimastigote) and infective (metacyclic trypomastigote) insect's life stages using RNA-seq and ribosome profiling. The observed steady state transcript levels support constitutive transcription and maturation implying the existence of distinctive posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms controlling gene expression levels at those parasite stages. Meanwhile, the downregulation of a large proportion of the translatome indicates a key role of translation control in differentiation into the infective form. The previously described proteomic data correlate better with the translatomes than with the transcriptomes and translational efficiency analysis shows a wide dynamic range, reinforcing the importance of translatability as a regulatory step. Translation efficiencies for protein families like ribosomal components are diminished while translation of the transialidase virulence factors is upregulated in the quiescent infective metacyclic trypomastigote stage.
   Conclusions: A large subset of genes is modulated at the translation level in two different stages of Trypanosoma cruzi life cycle. Translation upregulation of virulence factors and downregulation of ribosomal proteins indicates different degrees of control operating to prepare the parasite for an infective life form. Taking together our results show that translational regulation, in addition to regulation of steady state level of mRNA, is a major factor playing a role during the parasite differentiation.

AB This article argues that the stage version of Dickens's The Old Curiosity Shop, adapted by John Brougham as Little Nell and the Marchioness, may be the first American book musical. Its enduring success was largely attributed to the performance of Lotta Crabtree in the dual roles from 1866 onwards. If the status of the play is justified, then it may require some scholarly re-visioning of the early history of the American musical. Laurence Senelick is Fletcher Professor of Drama and Oratory at Tufts University and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. His translation of the letters of Konstantin Stanislavsky is about to be published by Routledge.

TI On the difficult work of translating translation; or, the monolingualism
   of translation theory. Languaging acts in (and after) Marie NDiaye's Les
   Serpents
SO STUDIES IN THEATRE AND PERFORMANCE
AB Award-winning playwright Marie NDiaye's language is, arguably, foreign to itself: Les Serpents (The Snakes) stages an implacably harsh world, meticulous precision, turns of phrase nearly stilted - inhabiting French like a stiff cloak, a rough mantle, a too-parched frock NDiaye's language is fastidious: every comma provokes a breath, a shift in rhythm, replicating the stultifying spirit of longing and wait the author's three protagonists subject one another to in the hot sun - a transgenerational game of radical dispossession. In this article, reflecting on my translation of the play, I probe questions of language and alterity, seeing in the author's work subtle occupation of nationalistic fantasies of monolingualism, as well as the ambivalent time and place of revolutionary America/France, neither of which emerges exactly on the page, as much as do the crisp clarity of a blazing sun, a cage, an open horizon, moulting, an impossible landscape. Rather than stage, naturalistically, a heterogeneous dialect or slang, or setting the play in one realm, NDiaye inhabits the French language so completely it becomes nearly rebuffing: at once the place and medium of performance, and the occasion for criticism itself, against the grain of theoretical monolingualism, also to moult.

TI The Pillar of Ibsenian Drama: Henrik Ibsen and Pillars of Society,
   Reconsidered
SO NEOPHILOLOGUS
AB Pillars of Society is the most ignored of the dozen major Ibsen prose plays. Written between 1875 and 1877, it was an immediate success and made Ibsen the champion of radical artists and social reformers throughout Europe. This drama remained part of the standard Ibsen repertory through the first several decades of the twentieth century and was produced a number of times in England and America. But it is rarely presented in English today. Critically the play has fared no better. Pillars of Society was the work that got William Archer excited about Ibsen, and it was the first Ibsen play to be translated into English-by Archer-but a few years after his translation he declared that British theater audiences had grown so advanced and enlightened that "the play already seemed commonplace and old-fashioned." Most modern critics seem to agree, by default if nothing else. To wit: no major critical essay or article on the play has been published in several decades, and even full-length books on Ibsen usually either pass over it entirely or grudgingly accept it as another one in the long bumbling series of Ibsen's "apprenticeship plays." Moreover, Pillars of Society is still approached as a "problem play" in the narrowest definition of that term. From this point of view, the meaning of the play indeed becomes simplistic, i.e., that bourgeois society is hypocritical and its leaders are often corrupt. Far from being an apprenticeship play, however, Pillars of Society is the mature work of a dramatic genius on which he brought all his imaginative powers to bear-the first time, in fact, that Ibsen's manifold creative talents become totally fused in the same work.

TI Representations of the dead and the afterlife in translations of Mudan
   Ting, a masterpiece in Chinese Kunqu theatre
SO BABEL-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE LA TRADUCTION-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF
   TRANSLATION
AB The aim of this paper is to identify and analyze the strategies used to translate into English death related cultural taboos viz. death, ghost and resurrection represented in the prominent classical Chinese drama Mudan Ting. Particular reference is made to the articulation of these taboos in three seminal English versions of Mudan Ting (as Peony Pavilion) by Cyril Birch, Wang Rongpei and Zhang Guanqian, respectively. Although these translators all follow the source text closely, certain differences in their translation strategies warrant attention. Cyril Birch takes an acculturation approach to the translation of death-related material, whereas Wang Rongpei adheres to the original text and tends to use semantic translation. In contrast, Zhang Guanqian usually translates literally, infusing the English text with a "foreign" flavor. These differences are examined in light of the general propensity among translators to take an avoidance approach to death-related material. The strategies used to translate taboo subjects are found to depend on the translator's intentions, the target readership, the specific nature of the culturally loaded elements and the availability of equivalent expressions in the target language and culture.

TI THE TAMING OF THE SHREW BY A.N. OSTROVSKY: SOME ASPECTS OF RECEPTION AND
   THE PRINCIPLES OF TRANSLATION OF SHAKESPEARE'S COMEDY
SO STUDIA LITTERARUM
AB Albeit being an experienced translator of foreign drama, A.N. Ostrovsky translated only one Shakespeare's piece - The Taming of the Shrew. His first attempt at its translation resulted in an abridged prose version entitled The Taming of the Spiteful Wife, which served as an embryo of the later prosimetric translation. While the interest in Shakespearean allusions in Ostrovsky's plays may be traced back to the works of contemporary critics, it was not until mid-20th century that a comprehensive study of the play's translation was written by a Shakespearean scholar M. Morozov further revisited and revised by Iu.D. Levin, V.I. Malikov, and N.K. Il'ina. Bearing on these studies, the author of this article demonstrates how the language of Ostrovsky's translation is related to the basic language principles of the playwright and shows his reliance upon the editorial practice of the 18th-19th centuries. The article highlights the translator's strategies in using verse and prose, blank verse and rhyme as a means to interpret Shakespearean characters, the genre and the style of the play. It also examines the synthesis of "domesticating" and "estranging" tendencies in the translated play.

TI Poetics of Aristotle in Russian Translations
SO PROBLEMY ISTORICHESKOI POETIKI
AB The article presents an overview of the existing translations of Aristotle's "Poetics", characterizes the features of each of them. In the preface to his translation of Aristotle's "Poetics", V. Zakharov characterized the work of the Greek philosopher as a "dark text." Each translation of this treatise, which forms the basis of European and world literary theory, is also its interpretation, an attempt to interpret the "dark places." The first Russian translation of "Poetics" was made by B. Ordynsky and published in 1854, however, the Russian reader was familiar with the contents of the treatise through translations into European languages and its expositions in Russian. For instance, in the "Dictionary of Ancient and New Poetry" Ostolopov sets out the Aristotelian theory of drama and certain other aspects of "Poetics" very close to the original text. Ordynsky translated the first 18 chapters of "Poetics", focusing on the theory of tragedy. The translator presented his interpretation of Aristotle's concept in an extensive preface, commentaries and a lengthy "Statement." This translation set off a critical analysis by Chernyshevsky, and influenced his dissertation "Aesthetic relations of art to reality", in which the author polemicizes with the aesthetics of German romanticism. In 1885 V. Zakharov published the first complete Russian translation of "Poetics", in which he offered his own interpretation of Aristotle's teaching on language and epic. The author of this translation returns to the terminology of romantic aesthetics, therefore the translation itself is outside the main line of perception of the teachings of Aristotle by domestic literary theory, which is clearly manifested in the translations of V. G. Appelrot (1893), N. N. Novosadsky (1927) and M. L. Gasparov (1978). The subject of discussion in these translations was the interpretation of the notions of mu upsilon sic omicron zeta and pi alpha theta omicron zeta, the concepts of mimesis and catharsis, the source of suffering and the tragic, the possibility of modernizing terminology. An important milestone in the perception and assimilation of Aristotle's treatise by Russian literary criticism was its translation by A. F. Losev, which was not published, but was used by the author in his theo-retical works and in criticizing other interpretations of "Poetics". M. M. Pozdnev penned one of the last translations of Poetics (2008). The translator does not seek to preserve the peculiarities of the original style and interprets "Poetics" within the framework and terms of modern literary theory, focusing on its English translations. The main subject of the translator's reflection is Aristotle's understanding of the essence and phenomenon of poetic art. Translations of the Greek philosopher's treatise reflect the history of the formation and development of the domestic theory of literature, its main topics and terminological apparatus.

TI Literary Translation As Cognitive Overlap Between Foreign And Native
   Languages
SO MODERN JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE TEACHING METHODS
AB The aim of this paper is to study the unique and universal features of the author's presentation of life and death based on the prose of late XIX - early XX centuries in the aspect of interaction between the Russian and English pictures of the world. We detail the results of lexicographical and etymological analysis, contextual, conceptual and cognitive review of translation strategies and techniques of Chekhov's fiction. A number of prose, drama and letters translations of Anton Chekhov by Constance Garnett Julius West and Gerard R. Ledger are examined for this purpose. By carrying out an analysis of these texts using a variety of methods we state that the effectiveness of translation is determined by the functionality of decoding. The personality of the interpreter acts as an intermediate link in the translation process, the competence and creative potential of whom provides interpretation of the author's ideas in the target language. Consequently, we validate hypotheses that the full convergence of ideas about life and death of the Russians and British facilitates the transfer of Chekhov's images into English to a large extend.

TI WD Repeat Domain 77 Protein Regulates Translation of E2F1 and E2F3 mRNA
SO MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY
AB WD repeat domain 77 protein (WDR77) is required for cellular proliferation of lung and prostate epithelial cells during earlier stages of development and is reactivated during prostate and lung tumorigenesis. WDR77 plays an essential role in prostate tumorigenesis and cell growth mediated by growth regulatory factors. Here, we identified E2F1 and E2F3 mRNAs as translational targets of WDR77. We demonstrated that WDR77 regulated the translation of E2F1 and E2F3 mRNAs through the 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) of E2F1 and E2F3 (E2F1/3) mRNAs. WDR77 physically interacted with programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) that suppresses translation of mRNAs containing structured 5' UTRs by interacting with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) and inhibiting its helicase activity. Further, we demonstrated that the interaction between WDR77 and PDCD4 prevented the binding of PDCD4 to eIF4A and relieved PDCD4's inhibitory effect on eIF4A1. Overall, our work reveals for the first time that WDR77 is directly involved in translational regulation of E2F1/3 mRNAs through their structured 5' UTRs, PDCD4, and eIF4A1 and provides novel insight into the cell growth controlled by WDR77.

TI WITTGENSTEIN'S LANGUAGE PLAYS
SO PHILOSOPHY AND LITERATURE
AB Wittgenstein included "playing theater" among the meanings of Sprachspiel, an association obscured by the translation of that word as "language game." Suggesting that we translate Sprachspiel as "language play," I argue that Wittgenstein developed a dramatic vocabulary by describing language as acts performed by actors in particular scenes and settings. In his own writing, he invented dramatic scenarios that are populated by characters and centered on sequences of action. These scenarios-Wittgenstein's "language plays"-with their flat characters and minimal stages, resonate with the theater of the absurd and influenced later dramatists such as Tom Stoppard.

TI JAROSLAV POKORNY IN SEARCH OF OEDIPUS THE KING
SO LISTY FILOLOGICKE
AB The translation work of Jaroslav Pokorny is rich and varied he translated prose, poetry as well as drama. Among modern languages he focused mainly on Italian; however he did not hesitate to translate from French and German either. Translations from Greek and Latin form an important chapter in this corpus. He was the first to bring practical theatrical experience into translation of ancient drama, which was unavailable to philologists including those who had some kind of contact with theatre, such as Ferdinand Stiebitz. From the beginning his concept of translation moved from philological translation meant primarily for reading to creating translation meant for rendition on stage, i.e. dramatic translation, which is, according to Pavel Drabek, a "special kind of translation. As opposed to literary translation it shows an anticipated presence of stage action, of which the utterances captured in the translation are only one component. In dramatic translation other forces are reflected too. First and foremost, it is the translator's theatrical taste and style, that is, a certain dramaturgy, which s/he considers adequate and optimal for translation of a particular dramatic text." (PAVEL DRABEK Ceske pokusy o Shakespeara [Czech Attempts at Shakespeare], Brno, Vane mlyny 2012, pp. 41-42). All Pokorny's translations of ancient playwrights are characterized (while not neglecting their literary aspects) by his attempts at stage effectiveness. However, his translations of Sophocles' Oedipus and Plautus' comedy Mostellaria in the first place brought something crucially new.
   The study focuses on the translation, or rather, three versions of the translation of Oedipus the King, the first of which came to life around 1942, the second one most probably shortly after the Second World War. The third was published for the first time in 1953 and first staged at the theatre in Liberec in 1962. It was only Miroslav Machacek's production at the National Theatre in Prague in 1963 that made this translation famous. Foreword to these texts was influenced by a Marxist concept of tragedy, as the Czech public knew it from G. Thomson's publication Aeschylus and Athens (published in Czech translation in 1952). Jaroslav Pokorny, well versed in the Czech translation theory, as represented in his time by the founders of the Prague Linguistic Circle Vilem Mathesius and Roman Jakobson, was the first to successfully apply functional aspect on translation of ancient literature as early as the 1940s. Thanks to this and to his dynamic concept of components of theatrical expression he created a translation in his early translation career (he was only little over twenty years old when working on Oedipus), which even 70 years later remains an example of a free but at the same time a serious approach to texts of ancient Greek drama.

TI Transfer to nemluveni speech and silence of translation into words anevb
   Very Linhartova drama.
SO CESKA LITERATURA
AB The article discusses two radio plays by Vera Linhartova (b. 1938), including their performance. It demonstrates that the chief means of utterance in both plays becomes the language that Linhartova always explores in relation to man. The first part of the text considers the distinctive critique of 'Iogocentrism in the play Pi:ekladatel (The Translator, 1969), in which a parallel is posited between the act of translating and man considered ontologically. The second part of the article interprets Linhartova's search for the boundaries of rational representation. The play PresYpaci hodina (The Hourglass, 1970) depicts human thinking as a palimpsest, which, when deprived of the possibility of speech, loses its metaphysical quality. The article also analyses the experimental essence of the plays, which consists in their minimalistic plots, conceptually formulated characters, and 'abstract' settings, but also the playwright's experiment with the essentiality of a literary work intended for radio broadcast, when in her dramas she thematizes the problem of the performativity of verbal expression.

TI Mind the gap: scaling up the utilization of insecticide treated mosquito
   nets using a knowledge translation model in Isingiro district, rural
   south western Uganda
SO HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE
AB Background: The phenomenon of Knowledge Translation (KT) is a key intervention towards bridging the 'know-do' gap. We conducted a KT initiative in Isingiro district to positively change attitude and improve on the uptake of Insecticide Treated Mosquito Nets (ITNs) as a malaria prevention strategy.
   Methods: This was a community based interactive initiative that was carried out within the seventeen administrative units of Isingiro district using varied dissemination activities, namely: health talks; drama activities, and the sharing of ITNs success stories.
   Results: We reached out to 34 dissemination groups, comprising communal gathering, religious crusades, open markets, secondary schools, and district administration. In addition, we spot-visited 46 households to ascertain the physical presence of ITNs, and their appropriate use. The major intervention was improved knowledge base of malaria causation and prevention strategies. The indicators for improved knowledge were hinged on the five-interventions, namely: (a) communal sensitization on malaria to provide, (b) monitoring and support of selected households, (c) emphasis of ITN use as a malaria prevention strategy, (d) promotion of care for ITNs, and (e) promotion of ITN use. In all, the major output was improved knowledge base of malaria causation and prevention strategies by providing accurate information to redress the myths and misconceptions related to malaria and ITNs use.
   Conclusion: This undertaking describes a consolidated community intervention to promote ITN utilization. It is plausible that this intervention positively enhances and promotes uptake and utilization of ITNs.

TI SHAKESPEARE'S RECEPTION IN ITALY: TWO TRANSLATIONS OF THE TEMPEST. A
   CASE STUDY
SO FOLIA LINGUISTICA ET LITTERARIA
AB Literary fortune, as eternal and immutable as it might seem in some cases, is always the result of a complex process of mediation, made of refusals, negotiations, misunderstandings, even feelings of repulsion and devotion. In other words, literary fame is rather a destination than a destiny. If Shakespeare acceptance in Europe was an exceptionally tortuous journey, him crossing the Alps proved even more problematic. All through the eighteenth-century Shakespeare's presence in Italy was virtually non-existent, while the first translation of his complete works only appeared in 1831. The first performance of a Shakespeare play to ever be attempted in Italy was staged around 1843, proving a remarkable fiasco. Two more decades will have to pass before a play meets the audience's applause, namely Ernesto Rossi's staging of Othello in 1856. From that point, also thanks to the influence of melodrama, Shakespeare's slow process of canonization was on its way to completion.
   The Italian case proves useful to understand how the processes literary canonization work. This paper analyzes what reasons may have led the Italian literary system to be so exceptionally resistant to Shakespeare, exploring how matters of ethnocentrism and chronocentrism are often at work when analyzing canonization.
   Finally, the contrastive analysis of two translations of The Tempest (Leoni's from 1815 and Carcano's from 1860) will show how translation choices are dictated by the translator's ideology, thus often mirroring the cultural paradigms of the period in which they are produced, but also how fundamental they are in shaping those paradigms and ignite cultural change.

TI Canadian Theatre in Latin America: Translation and Dissemination
SO INTERFACES BRASIL-CANADA
AB Canadian theatre has achieved a high level of popularity in Latin America and is now widely translated both for production and publication. Much of this success has been a mutual affair, the result of exchange programs between theatre companies in Mexico, Argentina, and other countries with those in Canada. This initiative largely originated in Quebec, which established bilateral agreements with theatre groups and cultural agencies from other countries in Latin America, especially Mexico, as early as the 1980s, and followed them up with theatre festivals, tours, and a continual stream of funding for translations. English Canadian dramatists as varied as Judith Thompson, Steve Galluccio, and Michael Mackenzie have been translated into Spanish, as well as a plethora of Quebec playwrights, from Michel Tremblay and Evelyne de la Cheneliere to Chantal Bilodeau and Suzanne Lebeau. Latin Americans living in Canada have also played a role. A whole generation of experienced Latin American translators has arisen to meet this challenge, many of them in Mexico encouraged by the French playwright, actor, and translator Boris Schoemann, who immigrated to Mexico twenty years ago. This essay, then, will give an overview of the development and diffusion of Canadian theatre in Latin America, with particular attention to the cultural exchange between the two regions and to the crucial role that translation has played in the evolution of Latin American interest in Canadian drama.

TI Bodily Passions: Physiognomy and Drama in Giovan Battista Della Porta
SO RENAISSANCE AND REFORMATION
AB This article explores the intersections of physiognomic knowledge and drama in the works of Neapolitan naturalist and playwright Giovan Battista Della Porta (1535-1616). It first looks at references to theatre classical drama in particular in Della Porta's writings on physiognomy, thus showing that Latin comic plays provided the naturalist with a gallery of stock characters able to summarize the alleged interdependence of physical and moral traits. The article then analyzes the various ways in which Della Porta who was a prolific author of comedies brought his physiognomic expertise into his own experience as a playwright. The study of these two different perspectives on the relation between physiognomy and drama reveals that, far from being a direct translation of physiognomic theories, Della Porta's dramatic production deploys an ironic and almost paradoxical take on physiognomy that aims to challenge (if not actually subvert) the very principles of the discipline.

It explores the problems faced by minority or minorized languages and cultures in achieving visibility on the international stage, showing how this impacts on notions of translatability. I analyse and contextualize perceptions of translation failure as regards the Catalan textual theatre tradition beyond its borders, comparing it with the relative success of Catalan visual performance internationally. This allows me to identify how market forces construct and limit intercultural theatre and spectatorship, and provides a window onto the specific problems faced by literary translation in a culture dominated by visual channels of communication. Combining insights from theorists of cultural transfer with work in intercultural theatre and performance studies, I highlight the ways in which theatre translation creates, engages and shapes intercultural spectatorship and I explore reception as an embodied phenomenon.

In 2019 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the play was staged at a time in which a fascistic conservatism was rising to power through the figure of incumbent president Jair Bolsonaro. The circumstances surrounding the decision to stage such a play are documented here, with accounts of the translation process (throughout 2018), which worked not only as a powerful antidote against the political situation of the country, but also, as in Miller's time, as a response to other theatrical works in vogue. This piece documents some of the paradoxes and challenges of producing foreign works in Brazil concerning costs and commercialization of plays.

TI Translating canons: Shakespeare on the Noh stage
SO SHAKESPEARE
AB Translating intercultural theatre is a complex practice. When Shakespeare is adapted into Asian traditional performance styles, the canonicity of the English text confronts the authenticity of the canonical performances in Asia. This essay analyses the process of intercultural translation of King Lear: His Shadows, a Noh adaptation of King Lear directed by Kurita Yoshihiro. Through the archiving process of this production in a multilingual digital archive called Asian Shakespeare Intercultural Archive (A|S|I|A), which provides English translation of the script, two dimensions of the intercultural translation can be observed: the translation and adaptation from Shakespeare's English text into Noh style in the process of the original production on the one hand, and the reverse translation of the Japanese script into English in the process of archiving on the other. Framing the former as the translation in Asia and the latter as the translation of Asia, I examine the characteristics of each translation and the interactions between these two processes, which demonstrate the strategies employed by the director to crystallize his appreciation of Shakespeare's play.

TI The emerging role of rectified thermal fluctuations in initiator
   aa-tRNA- and start codon selection during translation initiation
SO BIOCHIMIE
AB Decades of genetic, biochemical, biophysical, and structural studies suggest that the conformational dynamics of the translation machinery (TM), of which the ribosome is the central component, play a fundamental role in the mechanism and regulation of translation. More recently, single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) studies have provided a unique and powerful approach for directly monitoring the real-time dynamics of the TM. Indeed, smFRET studies of the elongation stage of translation have significantly enriched our understanding of the mechanisms through which stochastic, thermally driven conformational fluctuations of the TM are exploited to drive and regulate the individual steps of translation elongation [1]. Beyond translation elongation, smFRET studies of the conformational dynamics of the initiation stage of translation offer great potential for providing mechanistic information that has thus far remained difficult or impossible to obtain using traditional methods. This is particularly true of the mechanisms through which the accuracy of initiator tRNA- and start codon selection is established during translation initiation. Given that translation initiation is a major checkpoint for regulating the translation of mRNAs, obtaining such mechanistic information holds great promise for our understanding of the translational regulation of gene expression. Here, we provide an overview of the bacterial translation initiation pathway, summarize what is known regarding the biochemical functions of the IFs, and discuss various new and exciting mechanistic insights that have emerged from several recently published smFRET studies of the mechanisms that guide initiator tRNA- and start codon selection during translation initiation. These studies provide a springboard for future investigations of the conformational dynamics of the more complex eukaryotic translation initiation pathway and mechanistic studies of the role of translational regulation of gene expression in human health and disease.

TI Stages of the global: Media, sport, racialization and the last
   temptation of Zinedine Zidane
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW FOR THE SOCIOLOGY OF SPORT
AB Major sport spectacles are probably the most potent, vibrant stages on which human drama can be played out in real time before a vast international audience. Media sport, through global scale 'frozen moments', can precipitate popular interrogations of race' and its myriad connections to other socio-cultural structures and identities. This article considers the case of the now infamous incident of French captain Zinedine Zidane head-butting the Italian Marco Materazzi during the 2006 World Cup Final of association football in Germany, as a striking example of the political resonance and reach of mega-media sport, as well as of the perils of being 'lost' and 'found' in popular media translation. The persistence and pervasiveness of sexism in the language and metaphor of racism, it is argued, is an essential ingredient of the 'sexual racism' within the patriarchal genre of sports field insults. The immediate speculation and intense search for 'signs' of racism in the Zidane-Materazzi affair reveals that it lurks close below the surface of contemporary sport. This article advocates a cultural politics that understands and resists the causes of racism through sport, just as it refuses to legitimize racialized categories of the human in the process.

TI THE POETIC WORKS OF SERGEY YESENIN IN GERMANY: TRANSLATIONS, EDITIONS,
   AND RESEARCH
SO QUAESTIO ROSSICA
AB This article considers the perception of Sergey Yesenin's creative work in Germany. Having become acquainted with his works in its own language as early as the 1920s, Germany played the leading role in incorporating Yesenin into German-language culture. This research is based on the rich history of translation reception (made up of over 300 texts by over 60 translators), criticism and literary studies, and publication history. The article focuses on topical issues of modern literary studies, such as the aesthetics of reception, the dialogue of cultures, comparative studies, and imagology. The perception of the poet reflects the development of Russo-German literary connections in the 20th and 21st centuries. It is possible to single out three stages in the translation reception of Yesenin's works: acquaintance (1920s), popularisation (1950s-1980s), and the modern period. During the third stage, the reader came closer to understanding the authentic concepts of Yesenin's poetic semantics and techniques and a better knowledge of his creative work. The peculiarities of the publication history of the poet's works are to a large extent determined by the above stages, as well as the cultural and historical factors caused by the division of Germany. German-language Yesenin studies are characterised by a vast scope, multiple research strategies, and prominent researchers (D. Chizhevsky, D. Gerhardt, F. Mierau, etc.). The receptive character of the perception determines the combination of literary and translation strategies, which are mutually complementary. Hence, it is quite appropriate to consider German Yesenin studies a separate branch of the world literary studies. The results of German scholars' work are of significant importance to the history of Russian literature. The final stage of the perception model is the creative perception of the image of the poet as part of one's native linguistic culture. Dedication poems devoted to Yesenin written by G. Vesper and H. Czechowski in the 1990s are proof of a contemporary German dialogue with the Russian poet.

TI Drama, Censorship, and "Vernacular Theology"
SO STUDIES IN PHILOLOGY
AB This essay argues that late medieval religious drama belies the claim-articulated most influentially by Nicholas Watson-that fifteenth-century imaginative literature in England was dull and sterile, suffocated by the restrictions imposed by Archbishop Thomas Arundel's Constitutions of 1407-9. Although the Constitutions were significant, they hardly affected all the writers of religious texts at this time, and an influential gloss proscribing the translation of religious language into the vernacular has been found to have been universally ignored in the fifteenth century. The writers of playtexts, with their generous use of biblical translation, often seem to be quite free of the intimidations implied by the Constitutions. Plays such as the York cycle vividly dramatized the desecration of the sacred, visualizing for audiences scenes of brutal torture, seemingly without restraint, and the plays of the Towneley manuscript also offer representations of outrageous speech and behavior. These texts contradict the opinion that late medieval writing in post-Chaucerian England was dull, mediocre, and theologically weak by design to escape the draconian prohibitions of the Constitutions. The plays are capable instead of being imaginative re-creations of the biblical stories that were rightly valued in their own time and that cannot be easily dismissed in ours.

TI "Playing with Surgical Instruments (PlaSurIn)" game to train operating
   room novices how to set up basic surgical instruments: A validation
   study
SO NURSE EDUCATION TODAY
AB Background: Game-based training has been considered as an alternative modality to traditional training in different perioperative nursing fields.
   Objectives: To describe the adaptation and validation process of "Playing with Tweezers", a Portuguese game developed for novices to set up basic surgical instruments on the Mayo stand or a back table.
   Design: A validation study with three phases of translation, reconciliation, and evaluation (face, content, and construct validity).
   Settings: Several medical universities in Iran.
   Participants: Twelve students in a pilot translation test, 18 experts in the reconciliation phase, 20 experts in the face and content validity stages, and 120 students (72 novices, 26 intermediates, and 22 experts) in the construct validity stage.
   Methods: Following "forward-backward" translation from Portuguese to English, the English version of the game was appraised in the reconciliation phase using a 57-item questionnaire. To test face and content validity of the final version of the game, a 30-item questionnaire addressing different aspects of the game was completed. The students' game performance (remained time for game completion, obtained score, and error) was compared to assess the construct validity.
   Results: Minor differences were detected and resolved during the translation process. The English version of the game was reconciled in two sequential steps, and the final game called "Playing with Surgical Instruments (PlaSurIn)" was developed. All the items regarding the face validity received 80-100% of positive responses. Moreover, regarding the content validity, all of the evaluated items obtained a content validity index of 0.90-1.0. Compared to the novices, the experts and intermediates received higher scores (p < 0.001 in two cases) and fewer errors (p < 0.001, p = 0.007). The remained time for game completion was significantly longer for experts than the novices (p = 0.011).
   Conclusions: The "PlaSurIn", as a virtual training strategy, can prepare novices to set up basic surgical instruments.

TI Understanding the multi-sign communication system: A study on Peking
   Opera stage translation
SO FRONTIERS IN COMMUNICATION
AB Peking Opera is an artist-centered art rather than a director-centered one, and its true significance lies in its stage performance. However, the realization of the meaning of the "Performance Text" is the result of the joint action of different sign systems. Therefore, translators engaged in the stage translation of Peking Opera must understand the meaning and operation mechanism of this multi-sign system. From the perspective of semiotics of theater and drama, this paper deconstructs the Peking Opera sign system and divides them into several subsystems, describes in detail the characteristics of each secondary system, especially their semiotization process, their manners of meaning transmission, the rules of interaction among them, and finally presents the meaning generation and communication mechanism of this "Performance Text". On this basis, the paper clarifies that the main tasks and challenges faced by translators engaged in Peking Opera stage translation which are they should not only translate the language but also need to find time and space to realize the transformation of the meaning of the non-verbal sign system.

TI Narrating the Organization: Dramas of Institutional Identity.
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC SOCIOLOGY-EKONOMICHESKAYA SOTSIOLOGIYA
AB Czarniawska's book may seem to be quite a challenge for several reasons: the author's trademark "crossing genre boundaries" requires a reader to pay attention and stay confident; the outward simplicity of narrating organizational change stands on sophisticated philosophical, sociological, and philological grounds; and the language is eclectic but brilliantly puts together new empirically grounded and older, well-known theoretical concepts. Czarniawska tells a story of the Swedish public sector's reorganization with the accuracy of an academic and the eloquence of a narrator-institutions become apparent in their activities, as they are based on action, which is depicted by the coined term action nets. In a sense, the reader should be attentive and "follow the words". Though imagination is also a precondition, as the light but solid and convincing narrative constructions are open to further "translation" (in a hermeneutic and actor-network sense).
   Narrative knowledge and its metaphors make it much more productive for work with essential organizational paradoxes. Czarniawska points out that a narrative approach can help new institutionalism reflect on its own limitations and better understand institutional building. With a focus on verbal and written communication as well as employees' stories, we can trace how institutionalized thought structures, which are responsible for the repertoire of possible actions and shared perceptions among organization participants, are formed.
   The book is well written and pleasant for thoughtful reading in both its theoretical and empirical parts. The stories and serials of the Swedish public sector raise important questions of company-ization, technologyization, and rethinking organizational identity. "Narrating the Organization" can also offer some interesting methodological approaches and explanations for why and how stories "work" due to the modern trend of storytelling. The author openly invites her audience into a dialogue and joint-narrative creativity; the only task of the reader is merely to open the book.

TI Translating eroticism in traditional Chinese drama Three English
   versions of The Peony Pavilion
SO BABEL-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE LA TRADUCTION-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF
   TRANSLATION
AB This paper compares and contrasts three English versions of The Peony Pavilion, with a view to exploring the strategies adopted in the three translations in respect to their treatment of erotic passages in the Chinese dramatic masterpiece Mudan Ting. It is found that while all three translators generally respect the integrity of the Chinese source text, they demonstrate different trajectories in terms of their translational dispositions. Specifically, while Zhang Guangqian shows evidence of attenuating sexually sensitive material in his translation, Wang Rongpei demonstrates a tendency to translate in a register that is closer to contemporary English vernacular than to the highly poetic register that characterizes the original Chinese play.
   Cyril Birch differs from his two Chinese counterparts by faithfully preserving the poetic flavor of the erotic passages, to the extent that a foreign feel is often evident in his translation. The study also locates its findings against the background of previous studies, concluding that the general norm exhibited by the three translators in respect to the treatment of erotic passages in The Peony Pavilion, which is that of retention, departs from the norm of deletion/mitigation found in Chinese translations of English literature with sexual content. The paper hypothesizes that euphemism is not the universal norm adopted by translators in the treatment of sexually sensitive material in literature. Rather, the strategy used in translating eroticism is a function of the assumed acceptability of such material by the target readership.

The novel positions itself as part of an Algerian linguistic drama that, once translated into French as M moires de la chair, is problematically obscured. The press reviews of the novel's French translation serve to reveal, furthermore, that a French readership's familiarity with the significant corpus of Francophone Algerian literature mutes the legibility of the Algerian linguistic drama that Mustaghanami's novel articulates in the Arabic original.

Paker and Yilmaz's work, despite its comprehensive coverage from 1949 to 2004, leaves out the translations published in the latter half of the cut-off date, presumably due to the publication date of the issue. Therefore, the following chronological bibliography begins with the works that were not included in the previous study. Taking Paker and Yilmaz's research as its basis, this bibliography includes literary genres common to world literatures, such as poetry, drama, novel, short story, as well as creative non-fiction such as travel literature and memoir. Other works of non-fiction and self-published works are not represented here.

TI Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A in the pathogenesis of
   cancers
SO ONCOLOGY LETTERS
AB Cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide. The absence of obvious symptoms and insufficiently sensitive biomarkers in early stages of carcinoma limits early diagnosis. Cancer therapy agents and targeted therapy have been used extensively against tissues or organs of specific cancers. However, the intrinsic and/or acquired resistance to the agents or targeted drugs as well as the serious toxic side effects of the drugs would limit their use. Therefore, identifying biomarkers involved in tumorigenesis and progression represents a challenge for cancer diagnosis and therapeutic strategy development. The eukaryotic translation factor 5A (eIF5A), originally identified as an initiation factor, was later shown to promote translation elongation of iterated proline sequences. There are two eIF5A isoforms (eIF5A1 and eIF5A2). eIF5A2 protein consists of 153 residues, and shares 84% amino acid identity with eIF5A1. However, the biological functions of these two isoforms may be significantly different. Recently, it was demonstrated that eIF5Ais widely involved in the pathogenesis of a number of diseases, including cancers. In particular, eIF5A plays an important role in regulating tumor growth, invasion, metastasis and tumor microenvironment. It was also shown to serve as a potential biomarker and target for the diagnosis and treatment of cancers. The present review briefly discusses the latest findings of eIF5A in the pathogenesis of certain malignant cancers and evolving clinical applications.

SO JOURNAL OF ADAPTATION IN FILM & PERFORMANCE
AB The stage performance of Langbodo, a play, which Nigerian dramatist Wale Ogunyemi adapted from Soyinka's The Forest of a Thousand Daemons, which, in turn, is a translation of D. O. Fagunwa's prose, Ogboju Ode Ninu Igbo Irunmale. 'The bold hunter in the daemon-infested forest', exposed the limitation of the text as a bearer of meaning in the theatrical adaptation context. The limitation is analysed in this work to justify the centrality of adaptation in bridging the text-design-audience semiotic gap. This study examines the technical challenges of theatre design in D. O. Fagunwa's works resulting from their adaptation as drama. The Yoruba apothegmatic idiom, Enu 'dun n ro'fo, agada owo see san'ko (which means, literally, that 'vegetable soup can be prepared orally if a mere hand suffices for a cutlass'), a traditional derision for the inadequacies of the text, and the Barthesian notion of intertextuality serve as a dual theoretical structure in this study. A combination of methodologies including participant observation and ethnographic approach suffice for the retrieval and analysis of performance materials, respectively. Therefore, the study contends that the process of stage adaptation in Wale Ogunyemi's play, Langbodo, used the technical contributions of theatre design, as a catalyst for connecting Fagunwa's ideas to the final audience.

TI "EVERYTHING BECOMES MELODY" - REMARKS ON JENNY KLABIN SEGALL'S VERSIFIED
   TRANSLATION OF FAUST
SO CADERNOS DE TRADUCAO
AB The article analyzes the translation of Goethe's Faust by Jenny Klabin Segall regarding the verses used in the source text and in the target text. Considering the plurimetric structure of Faust and the differences between German and Portuguese prosody, the metric structure of several sections of the drama is analyzed, comparing Goethe's and the translator's decisions. It can be stated that the Portuguese verses are strictly oriented in the extension of the German verses, looking for metric "equivalents" whenever this was possible (in the case of ottava rima stanza and alexandrine). It is concluded that, although there are no Portuguese meters that "imitate" iambic or trochaic verses, the choice of pair verses for German iambs and impair for German trochees produces a differentiated rhythmic effect. For meters more divergent from Brazilian versification (Knittelvers, Freie Rhythmen), the translator found original solutions which draw near to the aesthetical effect of the original without transgressing the limits of Brazilian prosody.

TI Carmen and the Staging of Spain: Recasting Bizet's Opera in the Belle
   Epoque.
SO CAMBRIDGE OPERA JOURNAL
AB Musicologists have tended to assume that Berg's 'translation' of Buchner's play was an unproblematic affair and have felt free to set about uncovering how the music articulates the drama and the themes as if the meanings of play and opera were identical. In this article I listen to Wozzeck as a dialogue between Buchner's original fragment and Berg's operatic translation in a manner that acknowledges the differences between them. In particular I propose an alternative way of hearing nature in the opera that accords with Buchner's and Berg's own valorisation of the creative power of Life, rather than focusing on the political power of the idealist subject like many earlier appraisals of the opera. I first argue that, with Woyzeck, Buchner was opening up an exploratory space in which he asked his audience: 'If the autonomous self-identical subject is indeed illusory, what is the mechanism through which social progress can take place?' Second, I challenge the assumption that Berg managed to set the text in a neutral way, arguing that he imposed upon the fragments an alien set of aesthetic values and inadvertently dismantled the mechanism Buchner had designed to provoke audiences into thinking about volition and creativity. In the final two sections of the article, I argue that, despite the violence Berg did to Buchner's plan, the music in the opera's nature scenes can be heard to generate the philosophy of potential that Buchner was searching for in the original fragments.

TI The theatrical imagining of diasporic modernity in Shih-I Hsiung's Lady
   Precious Stream
SO JOURNAL OF POSTCOLONIAL WRITING
AB Lady Precious Stream (1934) is an English spoken drama adapted from Peking Opera by the Chinese British writer Shih-I Hsiung. Its commercial success in the Anglo American context during the 1930s is often seen as a result of its expression of the Chinese diasporic voice. This article explores the nature of this expression by situating the play within two processes of transcultural practice: first, the translation of the formof spoken drama from the west to China, and second, British chinoiserie forms of appropriating Chinese culture. The play's reconfiguration of gender, class, and international relations bears close thematic and ideological affinities with Chinese spoken drama, and thus can be seen as a "national allegory" of modern China. This context of "translated modernity" underwrites the play's intervention in British chinoiserie discourses and the way it challenges binary thinking about China in Britain.

TI Transcriptome-wide analyses of RNA m6A methylation in hexaploid wheat
   reveal its roles in mRNA translation regulation
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant RNA modification in eukaryotic messenger RNAs. m6A was discovered in wheat about 40 years ago; however, its potential roles in wheat remain unknown. In this study, we profiled m6As in spikelets transcriptome at the flowering stage of hexaploid wheat and found that m6As are evenly distributed across the A, B, and D subgenomes but their extents and locations vary across homeologous genes. m6As are enriched in homeologous genes with close expression levels and the m6A methylated genes are more conserved. The extent of m6A methylation is negatively correlated with mRNA expression levels and its presence on mRNAs has profound impacts on mRNA translation in a location-dependent manner. Specifically, m6As within coding sequences and 3 ' UTRs repress the translation of mRNAs while the m6As within 5 ' UTRs and start codons could promote it. The m6A-containing mRNAs are significantly enriched in processes and pathways of "translation" and "RNA transport," suggesting the potential role of m6As in regulating the translation of genes involved in translation regulation. Our data also show a stronger translation inhibition by small RNAs (miRNA and phasiRNA) than by m6A methylation, and no synergistical effect between the two was observed. We propose a secondary amplification machinery of translation regulation triggered by the changes in m6A methylation status. Taken together, our results suggest translation regulation as a key role played by m6As in hexaploid wheat.

TI Interpreting the Gitana: Translation and Cross-Dressing in Lope de
   Rueda's Medora
SO BULLETIN OF SPANISH STUDIES
AB This study examines translation and cross-dressing in Lope de Rueda's play, Medora. While Medora is translated from Gigio Artemio Giancarli's play Zingana, whose title showcases the Gypsy, Rueda's title announces transformationMedora is a perpetually feminized version of the gender-bending Medoro. The play's central drama involves the shifting identities of Gargullo and the Gitana. Building on Sidney Donnell's perception of the early modern audience's metatheatrical response to the male actor playing the Gypsy, which underscores a male actor playing the Gitana, I argue that in Medora, cross-dressing functions within an even larger system of translation that encompasses the fluid exchange between Spanish and Italian theatre. This study suggests that Lope de Rueda's Medoraexemplified by a Gitana cross-dressed ostensibly in traditional Gypsy garb and the self-declared converso and indiano, Gargullounderscores the importance of transformation, translation, and cross-dressing in the genesis of the emerging Spanish Comedia.

TI Localization and Functional Roles of Components of the Translation
   Apparatus in the Eukaryotic Cell Nucleus
SO CELLS
AB Components of the translation apparatus, including ribosomal proteins, have been found in cell nuclei in various organisms. Components of the translation apparatus are involved in various nuclear processes, particularly those associated with genome integrity control and the nuclear stages of gene expression, such as transcription, mRNA processing, and mRNA export. Components of the translation apparatus control intranuclear trafficking; the nuclear import and export of RNA and proteins; and regulate the activity, stability, and functional recruitment of nuclear proteins. The nuclear translocation of these components is often involved in the cell response to stimulation and stress, in addition to playing critical roles in oncogenesis and viral infection. Many components of the translation apparatus are moonlighting proteins, involved in integral cell stress response and coupling of gene expression subprocesses. Thus, this phenomenon represents a significant interest for both basic and applied molecular biology. Here, we provide an overview of the current data regarding the molecular functions of translation factors and ribosomal proteins in the cell nucleus.

TI Translating the Nineteenth Century: A Poetics of Eco-Translation
SO DIX-NEUF
AB What should we understand by eco-translation, in the translation of nineteenth-century French verse? Not the translation of texts that ecocriticism might deem to be eco-texts. Rather the translation of any text into eco-consciousness. This process concerns three aspects of the poetic text: the environment in which the poem locates its subject; the text's very textuality understood as a linguistic environment inhabited by the reader; and the immediate environment of the act of reading itself. The attempt to capture these three aspects in translation is rendered difficult by language's own obstructiveness, and requires the harnessing of a broader array of expressive resources. The article explores this predicament, using translations of Mallarme's 'Mes bouquins refermes' and Rimbaud's 'Au Cabaret-Vert' to make a case for translation's ecomorphic versatility.

TI Tongue-tied?: An active analysis of Brian Friel's Translations
SO STUDIES IN THEATRE AND PERFORMANCE
AB This article has arisen from a research-led production of Translations for Queen's University's Tyrone Guthrie Society in February 2010. Drawing partly on a review of the existing critical literature and also from questions left unresolved by a previous experience of directing the play, the production sought to address through 'active analysis' (Merlin 2001) a number of research questions relating to the embodied nature of the rehearsal process and the historicity of Friel's play. The analysis invokes Bergson (1910), Lefebvre (1991) and Worthen (2006) in establishing a performative correlative for insightful but more literary studies by Connolly (1993), Lojek (1994) and McGrath (1989 & 1999). A detailed account of the rehearsal process helps reveal the extent to which the idea of failure of communication is embedded in the text and embodied in performance, while an experiment with the partial use of the Irish language casts further light on Friel's extraordinary device of rendering two languages through the medium of one. The use of music to counterpoint, rather than underscore the action, together with an achronological sequence of projected historical images inspired by Andrews (1983) provided me as director with a means to challenge the audience's presuppositions about the play. The sense of palimpsest, of the layered histories, that this evoked also served to highlight Friel's use of the wider stylistic palette of Anglo-Irish drama, revealing Translations as a forerunner for Stewart Parker's more explicit formal experiments in Northern Star. In rehearsal and performance, Friel's place in the continuum of the Irish theatrical canon became clear, as stylistic allusions to O'Casey, Shaw, Wilde and Beckett were embodied by the actors on the rehearsal room floor.

TI Ribosome profiling in plants: what is not lost in translation?
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY
AB Translation is a highly dynamic cellular process whereby genetic information residing in an mRNA molecule is converted into a protein that in turn executes specific functions. However, pre-synthesized mRNA levels do not always correlate with corresponding protein levels, suggesting that translational control plays an essential role in gene regulation. A better understanding of how gene expression is regulated during translation will enable the discovery of new genes and mechanisms that control important traits in plants. Therefore, in recent years, several methods have been developed to analyse the translatome; that is, all mRNAs being actively translated at a given time, tissue, and/ or developmental stage. Ribosome profiling or ribo-seq is one such technology revolutionizing our ability to analyse the translatome and in turn understand translational control of gene expression. Ribo-seq involves isolating mRNAribosome complexes, treating them with a RNase, and then identifying ribosome-protected mRNA regions by deep sequencing. Here, we briefly review recent ribosome profiling studies that revealed new insights into plant biology. Manipulation of novel genes identified using ribosome profiling could prove useful for increasing yield through improved biotic and abiotic stress tolerance.

As part of a longitudinal research project, we set out to examine how personal images, understandings, and actions of family members (FMs) of persons with dementia and health care professionals (HCPs) change after the introduction of a research-based drama about the experiences of living with dementia called I'm Still Here. This article focuses on the shorter-(6 weeks) and longer-term (12 months) experiences of engaging with I'm Still Here and how those experiences triggered personal transformation. Design and
   Methods: Informed by phenomenology, this article presents findings from follow-up telephone interviews conducted 6 weeks and 12 months after FMs of persons with dementia and HCPs attended a live performance of I'm Still Here.
   Results: The phenomenological shifts reflected in the longitudinal data suggest a process of engagement with research-based drama that involves four themes: bearing witness to suffering evokes compassion; expanding with new awareness and understanding; finding comfort, confidence, and courage to change; and envisioning and enacting new possibilities.
   Implications: Findings demonstrate the possibilities of the arts for knowledge mobilization in changing the culture of dementia care through a process of illuminating new and enduring realizations and transforming actions and practices.

TI Resisting the Irish Other: the Berliner Ensemble's Production of The
   Playboy of the Western World
SO NEW THEATRE QUARTERLY
AB In this article David Barnett explores the Berliner Ensemble's production in 1956 of Synge's classic The Playboy of the Western World. Although it was directed by Peter Palitzsch and Manfred Wekwerth, Bertolt Brecht, the company's co-founder, loomed large in planning and rehearsal. This staging serves as an example of how a politicized approach to theatre-making can bring out relationships, material conditions, and power structures that the play's production history has often ignored. In addition, Barnett aims to show how Brechtian methods can be applied more generally to plays not written in the Brechtian tradition and the effects they can achieve. David Barnett is Professor of Theatre at the University of York. He is the author of Heiner Muller's 'The Hamletmachine' (Routledge, 2016), A History of the Berliner Ensemble (Cambrige, 2015) and Brecht in Practice: Theatre, Theory, and Performance (Bloomsbury, 2014). His recent AHRC-funded ` Brecht in Practice: Staging Drama Dialectically', led to a Brechtian production of Patrick Marber's Closer, and he offers theatre-makers and teachers workshops on using Brecht's method on stage and in the classroom.

TI The Rice Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 3 Subunit f (OseIF3f)
   Is Involved in Microgametogenesis
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB Microgametogenesis is the post-meiotic pollen developmental phase when unicellular microspores develop into mature tricellular pollen. In rice, microgametogenesis can influence grain yields to a great degree because pollen abortion occurs more easily during microgametogenesis than during other stages of pollen development. However, our knowledge of the genes involved in microgametogenesis in rice remains limited. Due to the dependence of pollen development on the regulatory mechanisms of protein expression, we identified the encoding gene of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, subunit fin Oryza saliva (OseIF3f). Immunoprecipitation combined with mass spectrometry confirmed that OseIF3f was a subunit of rice elF3, which consisted of at least 12 subunits including elF3a, eIF3b, elF3c, elF3d, elF3e, elF3f, elF3g, elF3h, elF3i, elF3k, elF3l, and elF3m. OseIF3f showed high mRNA levels in immature florets and is highly abundant in developing anthers. Subcellular localization analysis showed that OseIF3f was localized to the cytosol and the endoplasmic reticulum in rice root cells. We further analyzed the biological function of OseIF3f using the double-stranded RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) approach. The OseIF3f-RNAi lines grew normally at the vegetative stage but displayed a large reduction in seed production and pollen viability, which is associated with the down-regulation of OseIF3f. Further cytological observations of pollen development revealed that the OseIF3f-RNAi lines showed no obvious abnormalities at the male meiotic stage and the unicellular microspore stage. However, compared to the wild-type, OseIF3f-RNAi lines contained a higher percentage of arrested unicellular pollen at the bicellular stage and a higher percentage of arrested unicellular and bicellular pollen, and aborted pollen at the tricellular stage. These results indicate that OseiF3f plays a role in microgametogenesis.

TI Predictors of Failure of Return to Play in Youth Baseball Players After
   Capitellar Osteochondritis Dissecans: Focus on Elbow Valgus Laxity and
   Radiocapitellar Congruity
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
AB Background:
   Osteochondritis dissecans of the humeral capitellum (capitellar OCD) is a common injury among youth baseball players, but there are only a few studies that report on return to play with nonoperative treatment.
   Purpose:
   To evaluate the medial elbow joint laxity under valgus stress and radiocapitellar congruity in patients with capitellar OCD and evaluate their relationship to predicting rehabilitation outcome.
   Study Design:
   Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3.
   Methods:
   Capitellar OCD was diagnosed in 81 patients included in our study. All patients were elementary school students who initially received rehabilitation treatment after injury. The rates of return to the same level of play or higher (RTSP) were calculated and correlated with the joint gap difference between the dominant and nondominant elbows using ultrasound and radiocapitellar congruity (proximal, lateral, and anterior radial translation length), which was assessed using plain radiographs of the dominant elbow.
   Results:
   The overall RTSP rates of patients with nonoperative treatment was 70.4% (57/81). The multivariate logistic regression analysis identified OCD classification (stage I, odds ratio [OR], 4.076; 95% CI, 1.171-14.190) and 1 continuous variable (proximal radial translation length on anteroposterior view, OR, 0.661; 95% CI, 0.479-0.911) as the significant predictive factors for outcome after nonoperative treatment.
   Conclusion:
   The early stage of capitellar OCD in youth baseball players can be successfully treated nonoperatively in the majority of cases. The presence of proximal radial translation can predict the outcome of nonoperative management of capitellar OCD.

TI Roles of the translation initiation factor eIF2 alpha serine 51
   phosphorylation in cancer formation and treatment
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-GENE REGULATORY MECHANISMS
AB Cells respond to various forms of stress by activating anti-proliferative pathways, which allow them to correct the damage caused by stress before re-entering proliferation. If the damage, however, is beyond repair, stressed cells are eliminated from the host by undergoing death. The balance between cell survival and death is essential for cancer formation and is determined by several key pathways that impact on different stages of gene expression. In recent years, it has become evident that phosphorylation of the alpha (alpha) subunit of the translation initiation factor eIF2 at serine 51 (eIF2 alpha S51P) is an important determinant of cell fate in response to stress. Induction of eIF2 alpha S51P is mediated by a family of four kinases namely, HRI, PKR, PERK and GCN2, each of which responds to distinct forms of stress. Increased eIF2 alpha S51P results in a global inhibition of protein synthesis but at the same time enhances the translation of select mRNAs encoding for proteins that control cell adaptation to stress. Short-term induction of eIF2 alpha S51P has been associated with cell survival whereas long-term induction with cell death. Studies in mouse and human models of cancer have provided compelling evidence that eIF2 alpha S51P plays an essential role in stress-induced tumorigenesis. Increased eIF2 alpha S51P exhibits cell autonomous as well as immune regulatory effects, which can influence tumor growth and the efficacy of anti-tumor therapies. The findings suggest that eIF2 alpha S51P may be of prognostic value and a suitable target for the design and implementation of effective anti-tumor therapies.

TI Positive Feedback Stimulation of Ccnb1 and Mos mRNA Translation by MAPK
   Cascade During Mouse Oocyte Maturation
SO FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB In mammalian species, both the maturation promoting factor (MPF) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade play critical roles in modulating oocyte meiotic cell-cycle progression. MPF is a critical heterodimer composed of CDK1 and cyclin B1. Activation of MPF and ERK1/2 requires the activation of maternal Ccnb1 and Mos mRNAs translation, respectively. The phosphorylation and degradation of CPEB1 that triggered by ERK1/2 is a principal mechanism of activating maternal mRNA translation. However, the interplay of these two key kinases in mediating mammalian translational activation of cytoplasmic mRNAs during oocyte maturation is unclear. We prove evidence that the translational activation of Ccnb1 transcripts containing a long 3 '-UTR during meiotic resumption works in an ERK1/2-dependent way. A low level of ERK1/2 activation was detected prior to meiotic resumption. Precocious activation of MAPK signaling in germinal vesicle stage oocytes promotes the translation of Ccnb1 mRNA and meiotic maturation. Inhibition or precocious activation of CDK1 activity has an appreciable effect on the translation of Ccnb1 mRNA, suggesting that both kinases are required for Ccnb1 mRNA translational activation. CDK1 triggers phosphorylation, but not degradation, of CPEB1 in oocytes; the degradation of CPEB1 was only triggered by ERK1/2. Moreover, the translational activation of Mos mRNA is regulated by ERK1/2 and cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements too. Taken together, the cooperation and positive feedback activation of ERK1/2 and CDK1 lead to the fine-tuning of mRNA translation and cell-cycle progression during mouse oocyte maturation.

TI Censorship, translation and integration in the theatre of the francoist
   era: Jose Lopez Rubio, man of theatre and translator
SO HISPANIC RESEARCH JOURNAL-IBERIAN AND LATIN AMERICAN STUDIES
AB Spanish theatre professionals were responsible for the integration of foreign theatre in Spanish stages in Francoist Spain. The role of theatre translators, or of Spanish playwrights-translators, has been seldom tackled, and the hundreds of versions of American or British plays are yet to be fully studied. This paper focuses on Spanish author Jose Lopez Rubio, whose production, both originally written in Spanish and translated, has been thoroughly catalogued, using censorship archives as the main source of documentation. While compiling the catalogue it became clear that the number of translations signed by Lopez Rubio is higher than that of original plays. This catalogue is analyzed and a specific case study is presented: the Broadway musical Man of La Mancha. This production saw its second world premiere in Madrid, with the aid of the authorities in charge of the Theatre and Cinema General Directorate, in the Ministry for Information and Tourism, who favoured a positive image of the regime abroad.

TI Appearances Character description as a network of signification in
   Russian translations of Jane Eyre
SO TARGET-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSLATION STUDIES
AB This article re-evaluates the theoretical import of networks of signification, one of Antoine Berman's twelve deforming tendencies in translation. Taking Jane Eyre as a case study, the article considers character description as an example of a Bermanian network and traces the physical appearance of the novel's characters across its six Russian translations. Character description represents a network that is traceable, depends on the reader's ability to construct a visual mental image over the course of a narrative, has a tangible impact on characterisation, and remains relevant throughout a novel. It thus offers a concrete illustration of the relevance of networks of signification as a model for the systemic interpretative potential of translation variation. This analysis paves the way for further study of Bermanian networks and the ultimate integration of this concept in translation practice.

TI Poetic language and corporeality in translations of Greek tragedy
SO NEW THEATRE QUARTERLY
AB The translation of ancient tragedy is often considered at a linguistic level, as if the drama consisted simply of words being written, spoken, and heard. This article contends that translation for the stage is a process in which literary decisions have physical, as well as verbal, outcomes. It traces existing formulations concerning the links between vocal and bodily expression, and explores the ways in which printed texts might be capable of suggesting modes of corporeality or systems of movement to the embodied performer; and sketches some of the ways in which the range of possible relationships between language and physicality might be explored and understood, drawing upon recent practice-based research into the work of three modern poetic translators of Greek tragedy. Stephe Harrop is a theatre practitioner and academic whose work explores the links between text and physical performance. She originally trained as a dancer, and currently teaches at Royal Holloway, University of London. David Wiles is Professor of Theatre at Royal Holloway. His research interests include Greek theatre, masked performance, and drama in translation. His most recent publications include A Short History of Western Performance Space (2003) and Mask and Performance in Greek Tragedy (2007).

TI Translation in Performance: Theatrical Shift and the Transmission of
   Meaning in Tony Harrison's Translation of Euripides Hecuba
SO CONTEMPORARY THEATRE REVIEW
AB 'It's one thing to strive for relevance - it's another to drain away the play's enigmas in the quest for easy access', writes Victoria Segal in her 'Sunday Times' review of Tony Harrison's new translation of Euripides' Hecuba for the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) in 2005. My article analyses the transfer from text to stage in the RSC touring production, illustrating the participation of theatre translation in the transfer of meaning between page and stage, and between author and interpreter, assuming that the 'interpreter' may take a variety of guises including and extending beyond that of the translator. Firstly, I consider Harrison's transmission of meaning by situating his translation in the context of a particular history of performances and interpretations; then I review the collaborative theatre practices which influence the relocation of meaning; and finally I interrogate the transmission of meaning as revealed by a study of the reception of this production. I examine the role of translation in the relocation of meaning through performance and, invoking Gadamer's 'concretion of historically effected consciousness', suggest that the multiple possibilities of meaning resulting from a movement through time, language and medium may nevertheless combine in an incorporeal unity. Harrison identifies 'that bond of empathy and compassion that can cross centuries' as the affect of the play for its audience. My paper investigates transmission of this affect through the distinctive process of translation for performance.

Published in London in 1823, this play explores the reactions to the coup led by Rafael de Riego in the court of Ferdinand VII. The author clearly supports the liberal cause and portrays the King as a weak and changeable individual, who first tries to repress the rebellion, but eventually proclaims the Constitution of 1812. Although the work is presented as the English translation of a Spanish manuscript by Manuel de Sarratea, the image of Spain and of the liberal revolution of 1820 contained in the text is in tune with the vision of the political situation in Spain that dominated public opinion in Britain.

TI TRUTH IN TRANSLATION: THE TRC AND THE TRANSLATION OF THE TRANSLATORS
SO BIOGRAPHY-AN INTERDISCIPLINARY QUARTERLY
AB This paper argues that to a significant degree the work of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission was a linguistic challenge, involving the use of eleven official languages. The TRC was a polylingual, thus heteroglossic public staging of tragedy that was orally-determined, thus accommodating sections of the South African society that Would have been excluded had the standard forms of exclusion-English language and writing-been used as means of communication. The paradox of the linguistic challenge lies in how the testimonies lodge themselves in the minds of the translators, who are initially vicarious participants in narrated events but who find themselves becoming active participants through the act of translation. This leads to a collapse of the assumed spaces between the identities of the translators, their senses of communal bonds, and separateness from the witnesses, as the "storying" and '"re-storying" of the past becomes a palpable presence through their secondary roles. An examination of Michael Lessac's Truth in Translation and Ingrid de Kok's poems in Terrestrial Things highlights the difficulties of translation, and how this continues to confound viewers of Lessac's play.

SO LINGUISTICA ANTVERPIENSIA NEW SERIES-THEMES IN TRANSLATION STUDIES
AB This article examines Harold Acton's translation of Popular Chinese Plays. It examines the modifications Acton made in the final polishing stage of his translation and explores possible linguistic, aesthetic and social considerations for such alterations. Four plays-Ch. un-hsiang Nao Hsueh Shih Hou Chi Lin Ch. ung Yeh Pen and Yu Chou Feng-were selected for this research. Computerized data were analysed using Wordsmith 4.0. This article demonstrates that at this later stage of the translation's genesis, Acton gives priority to the overall effectiveness and coherence of the translation while paying less attention to lexical and syntactical details. His corrections to the manuscript indicate that the translator departs from the source text, displaying more independence as a writer. The purpose of this analysis is to show how translators. strategies can evolve during the genesis of a translation, thus complicating the common assumption that translators adopt a consistent "stance" when translating.

TI The Rice Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 3 Subunit e (OselF3e)
   Influences Organ Size and Pollen Maturation
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (elF3) is a large protein complex that participates in most translation initiation processes. While elF3 has been well characterized, less is known about the roles of individual elF3 subunits, particularly in plants. Here, we identified and characterized OselF3e in rice (Oryza saliva L.). OselF3e was constitutively expressed in various tissues, but most strongly in vigorously growing organs. Transgenic Ose/F3e-silenced rice plants showed inhibited growth in seedling and vegetative stages. Repression of OselF3e led to defects in pollen maturation but did not affect pollen mitosis. In rice, elF3e interacted with elF3 subunits b, d, e, f, h, and k, and with elF6, forming homo- and heterodimers to initiate translation. Furthermore, OselF3e was shown by yeast two -hybrid assay to specifically bind to inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases 1, 5, and 6. This interaction was mediated by the sequence of amino acid residues at positions 118-138, which included a conserved motif (IGPEQIETLYQFAKF). These results suggested although OselF3e is not a "functional core" subunit of elF3, it still plays crucial roles in rice growth and development, in combination with other factors. We proposed a pathway by which OseIF3e influence organ size and pollen maturation in rice, providing an opportunity to optimize plant architecture for crop breeding.

TI The staging of Islam and The Alcoran of Mahomet in Charles Saunders's
   Tamerlane the Great and the Restoration politics
SO SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
AB Charles Saunders's Tamerlane the Great (1681) appropriates Islam and the Qur'an, first translated into English as The Alcoran of Mahomet in 1649, to attack the influence of the Earl of Shaftesbury (1621-1683) on the Duke of Monmouth, the eldest Protestant son of Charles II. Saunders's play dramatises two models of royal sons from the Tories' perspective: Firstly, the loyal Arsanes, who represents the Tories' idealised expectation of Monmouth to be an obedient son. Secondly, the illegitimate Mandricard, who envisions the Tories' damnation of Monmouth as a slave to Shaftesbury. While Saunders's play warns allegorically against the radical Protestants' association with, what Garcia calls, 'Islamic republicanism', it advocates 'Islamic royalism' as a Qur'anic principle of the divinity of monarchs that appealed to the Tories. Saunders's play ends with a reconciliation between Tamerlane/Charles II and his son Arsane/Monmouth, staging simultaneously the defeat of Bajaset and the Turks/radical Protestants.

TI Unreferenced English articles' translation quality-oriented automatic
   evaluation technology using sparse autoencoder under the background of
   deep learning
SO PLOS ONE
AB Currently, both manual and automatic evaluation technology can evaluate the translation quality of unreferenced English articles, playing a particular role in detecting translation results. Still, their deficiency is the lack of a close or noticeable relationship between evaluation time and evaluation theory. Thereupon, to realize the automatic Translation Quality Assessment (TQA) of unreferenced English articles, this paper proposes an automatic TQA model based on Sparse AutoEncoder (SAE) under the background of Deep Learning (DL). Meanwhile, the DL-based information extraction method employs AutoEncoder (AE) in the bilingual words' unsupervised learning stage to reconstruct the translation language vector features. Then, it imports the translation information of unreferenced English articles into Bilingual words and optimizes the extraction effect of language vector features. Meantime, the translation language vector feature is introduced into the automatic DL-based TQA. The experimental findings corroborate that when the number of sentences increases, the number of actual translation errors and the evaluation scores of the proposed model increase, but the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score is not significantly affected. When the number of sentences increases from 1,000 to 6,000, the BLEU increases from 96 to 98, which shows that the proposed model has good performance. Finally, the proposed model can realize the high-precision TQA of unreferenced English articles.

TI Translation control of Enterovirus A71 gene expression
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL SCIENCE
AB Upon EV-A71 infection of a host cell, EV-A71 RNA is translated into a viral polyprotein. Although EV-A71 can use the cellular translation machinery to produce viral proteins, unlike cellular translation, which is cap-dependent, the viral RNA genome of EV-A71 does not contain a 5 ' cap and the translation of EV-A71 protein is cap-independent, which is mediated by the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) located in the 5 ' UTR of EV-A71 mRNA. Like many other eukaryotic viruses, EV-A71 manipulates the host cell translation devices, using an elegant RNA-centric strategy in infected cells. During viral translation, viral RNA plays an important role in controlling the stage of protein synthesis. In addition, due to the cellular defense mechanism, viral replication is limited by down-regulating translation. EV-A71 also utilizes protein factors in the host to overcome antiviral responses or even use them to promote viral translation rather than host cell translation. In this review, we provide an introduction to the known strategies for EV-A71 to exploit cellular translation mechanisms.

TI Translation and adaptation as interpretation and strategy: My seuns by
   Christo Davids against the background of All My Sons by Arthur Miller
SO TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE
AB In this article the processes of translation, adaptation or conversion are equated to the two plays All my Sons by Arthur Miller and My seuns by Christo Davids. These processes entail the transforming of a source text (SC) to a target text ('1?) which constitutes a mediation between two cultures. In the introductory part of the article relevant theories pertaining to translation in the broad sense of the word, are briefly discussed. These discussions include reference to the processes of domestication and foreignization (Venuti) which entail bringing the original culture closer to home or, on the other hand, stressing the distance between source and target culture. Furthermore, reference is made to theatrical translation (Aaltonen): the time-sharing of texts on stage as well as semiotic translation or adaptation (Marais) as a complex cross-cultural concept, an emergent phenomenon that emerges out of relationships between individuals. .1Iarais's approach against the background of Alltonen's theatrical translation is primarily descriptive and its purpose is to describe mechanisms, choices, strategies of translation in terms of the creation of new meanings in new contexts; in other words: translation as a semiotic process. In order to engage in discussions on a theory and deviations in the application thereof one needs to demarcate and define the domain in detail before reflecting on any anomalies and peripheral issues. In considering theories regarding translation, one realises that adaptation or conversion into a completely new text, demonstrates tangencies with translation practices. An adaptation or conversion into a new text is thus by its very nature a form of translation.
   As far as translation is concerned, one of the core discussions has always been the relationship between - and the primacy of- the original text (the source text) and the translated text (the target text), and with it the source and target culture. This is linked to a number of divergent views on what faithfulness to the source text in varying contexts would actually mean. In the 1970s, the skopos-theory was introduced by Hans J. Vermeer and was later expanded by Christiane Nord (2001). Since every action has a purpose (Skopos is the Greek word for purpose), so should it be in translation. What this means is that the Skopos or purpose of a translation will determine whether domestication or alienation will prevail and whether there may be a combination of the two extremes. Nord (2006) explains this theory on the basis of the well-known Jakobsonian theory of communication (1960). She distinguishes between "intention / purpose" and "function": the translator has a spec* aim with his work and tries to induce a certain response from the recipient (reader). Translation is thus functionally and pragmatically directed Furthermore, based on Nord (1997), it can be argued that the purpose of the translation determines the methods and strategies.
   In the latter part of this article, fundamental interpretative possibilities of the theories are discussed with specific reference to the use of domestication in My seuns due to the fact that Davids domesticates the universal thematic approach ofMiller in All my Sons to a South African reality. It is important for the translator to be aware ofa particular choice or preference in an attempt to apply his/her translation or adaptation brief whether self-imposed or not, for the benefit of the text itself. The translation, adaptation or conversion could be source text oriented within a relational translation or adaptation strategy. It could also be more semiotically oriented within a clear target text (other text) translation, adaptation or conversion strategy. Based on what Marais regards as translation, My seuns, is infact not merely inspired byArthur, Miller, but converted and therefore "translated" into a new culture. Thus, this article seeks to identify the poetical preferences of the translator before an attempt is made to describe (and evaluate) the final product within a discussion of the success of the new text against the background of the original and whether or not it succeeds as adaptation/conversion.

TI eIF4B mRNA Translation Contributes to Cleavage Dynamics in Early Sea
   Urchin Embryos
SO BIOLOGY-BASEL
AB Simple Summary Cell division, also known as mitosis, relies on a complex cascade of molecular events that orchestrates the whole process and decides when cells can start dividing. A key factor in this process is protein synthesis, which is carefully regulated inside the cell to assure the timely production of all the proteins required for mitosis. The embryos of sea urchins divide rapidly after fertilization and represent an informative model to analyze the role of protein synthesis regulation during cell cycle progression. For example, the analysis in the 1980s of sea urchin embryos fostered the discovery of Cyclin B, the first representative of a family of proteins that plays a universal role in controlling cell division. This finding was awarded in 2001 with the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine. However, much remains to be learned, and how protein synthesis controls the time and speed of mitosis in a developing embryo is still unclear. For instance, discovering whether the translation of other mRNAs than mitotic cyclins is required to finely regulate the rate of embryonic cleavage has never been tested. In this work, we investigated the role of the translation of an mRNA encoding a protein called eIF4B in the dynamics of embryonic cell division. We showed that newly synthesized eIF4B directly impacts cell division rates in two sea urchin species. Cell divisions are delayed when the production of eIF4B is inhibited in a fertilized egg. Conversely, increased production of eIF4B accelerates mitosis. Therefore, eIF4B mRNA translation represents a new means to regulate the pace of embryonic cleavages. Moreover, since eIF4B is a translational regulator, our findings suggest that the function of its mRNA translation is boosting the production of other proteins essential for mitosis. The cells of the sea urchin embryos seem thus equipped with a controlling device capable of modulating cell division rates, a molecular switch that could contribute to coordinating the first steps of development in other animals as well. During the first steps of sea urchin development, fertilization elicits a marked increase in protein synthesis essential for subsequent cell divisions. While the translation of mitotic cyclin mRNAs is crucial, we hypothesized that additional mRNAs must be translated to finely regulate the onset into mitosis. One of the maternal mRNAs recruited onto active polysomes at this stage codes for the initiation factor eIF4B. Here, we show that the sea urchin eIF4B orthologs present the four specific domains essential for eIF4B function and that Paracentrotus lividus eIF4B copurifies with eIF4E in a heterologous system. In addition, we investigated the role of eIF4B mRNA de novo translation during the two first embryonic divisions of two species, P. lividus and Sphaerechinus granularis. Our results show that injection of a morpholino directed against eIF4B mRNA results in a downregulation of translational activity and delays cell division in these two echinoids. Conversely, injection of an mRNA encoding for P. lividus eIF4B stimulates translation and significantly accelerates cleavage rates. Taken together, our findings suggest that eIF4B mRNA de novo translation participates in a conserved regulatory loop that contributes to orchestrating protein synthesis and modulates cell division rhythm during early sea urchin development.

AB Translation supplied early modern students with a first output for their academic career, while introducing them to the workings of the printing trade. This article shows that through translation students could also become information brokers in the Republic of Letters. I focus on Friedrich Wilhelm Roloff (1714-1741) in Berlin, who translated a single chapter from the Histoire critique de Manichee et de manicheisme (1734) by the Huguenot theologian Isaac de Beausobre (1659-1738). Highlighting the paratexts of Roloff's publication, I argue that print enabled students to play the role of mediators in theological disputes. Translating Beausobre's chapter into the material format of a printed dissertation, Roloff dedicated his book to Siegmund Jakob Baumgarten (1706-1757), commemorating Baumgarten's appointment as professor at Halle.

TI "Cheerful or Merry?" Investigating Literary Translation Revision
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF FRENCH STUDIES
AB In this paper I discuss the process of revision undergone by my translation into English of Yasmina Reza's play Dans la luge d'Arthur Schopenhauer. Once the first draft was completed and in order to produce a natural-sounding final draft, I carried out a self-revision in collaboration with an English native-speaker, a playwright with some experience in transcreation. I will show how our respective interlanguages affected the final choices made. A corpus-based study comparing the first draft with the final draft demonstrates that a largely unconscious adherence to translation norms and the reviser's stylistic preferences both converge to arrive at a translation for the stage rather than the page. This paper confirms the importance of translation revision and how the process can be improved with the use of simple digital tools.

TI Lee Hyon-u's Hamlet Q1 and Pedagogical Performance on the Korean Stage:
   Textual Identity in Intercultural Theatre
SO ASIAN THEATRE JOURNAL
AB This paper examines the first Korean incarnation of the First Quarto of Hamlet, Lee Hyon-u's Hamlet Ql (2009), by analyzing the challenges and opportunities attending its production. Hamlet Ql signals a dramaturgical and conceptual shift from the melancholic Hamlets often framed in contexts of Korean shamanism to the unconventionally active Hamlet of the quarto of 1603. The production enlivens textual scholarship and fills a pedagogical void by propagating the idea of "multiple-text plays" to Lee's student-based audience. The indigenization of Lee's Hamlet Ql is a farm of contextual translation that facilitates understanding of Hamlet's original cultural contexts.

TI EUROPEAN DRAMA AS A DIDACTIC MATERIAL: MOLIERE AND GOLDONI AT THE
   LESSONS OF RUSSIAN FOR GREAT DUCHESS ALEXANDRA FEDOROVNA
SO IMAGOLOGIYA I KOMPARATIVISTIKA-IMAGOLOGY AND COMPARATIVE STUDIES
AB Translation activities of V.A. Zhukovsky in the Russian literary criticism have been studied widely and comprehensively. However, the purposes of his translations are not limited to aesthetic, enlightenment and life-building aspects: the poet translated not only texts in which he found consonance to his aesthetic consciousness but also "on order" and for narrowly pragmatic and utilitarian purposes: these are fragmentary translations of the two most famous European comedies: Moliere's The Bourgeois Gentleman and Carlo Goldoni's The Beneficent Bear. When used as a didactic materi- al while learning a foreign language, texts of dramas acquire special significance, for they offer samples of dialogues - the kind of speech communication essential in teaching any language as a foreign one. It is all the more interesting that Zhukovsky chooses fragments from comedies for his lessons as he never fancied the genre. However, Zhukovsky's choice of the comedy for a specific - didactic - purpose is well motivated by his aesthetic views. In the Notes on the History of Literature and Criticism, he unequivocally defined the purpose of the comedy primarily as a school of public morality. Thus, two fragments of European comedies, translated for Russian lessons with the Grand Duchess, combined two kinds of didactic purposes: strategic, i.e. educational, which Zhukovsky saw in the comedy genre in general, and tactical, i.e. pedagogical.
   The choice of Moliere's comedy episode, the plot of which is a lesson in orthoepy and stylistics, is clearly correlated with its pragmatic purpose. Zhukovsky intentionally inserts a piece which sets out the rules for the pronunciation of Russian yotized vowels and the specific "yery" vowel in Moliere's text. The translation is generally Russified in terms of style to reproduce the style of Russian everyday colloquial speech. The fragment about the word order in the Russian phrase translated close to the text is very expressive. The rule is especially important for the Russian-German language pair: in German, the word order is very different due to the final position of the verb in the phrase and the verb-preposition relations.
   Goldoni's comedy The Beneficent Bear became known in Russia almost immediately after its creation in 1771 and enjoyed particular success, which the repertoire list of Russian theaters of the late 18th and early 19th centuries shows. Zhukovsky could have known Goldoni's comedy not only by its original text, but also by the prose German version of its plot: in 1801, Johann-Jacob Engel (1741-1802), a German writer and educator of Friedrich-Wilhelm III, the future Prussian king, wrote Herr Lorenz Stark, a family novel of life and manners based on The Beneficent Bear.
   Both Goldoni's comedy, and especially Engel's novel must have been familiar in their originals to Grand Duchess Alexandra Feodorovna, who was the daughter of a pupil of Johann-Jacob Engel, Prussian King Frederick-Wilhelm III: this could be a motivation for Zhukovsky's choice of the text to study Russian with the Grand Duchess. For the lessons, Zhukovsky translated Act 2 Scene 1 of the comedy: the dispute between Geronte and Dorval while playing chess, which is an example of a rapid and dynamic dramatic dialogue, representative for mastering this form of verbal communication in the process of learning a foreign language. Obviously, both Zhukovsky's strategy of translation selection and all translation innovations are subordinated to a specific purpose: to teach his royal student Russian orthoepy, vocabulary, idioms, and dialogue as a form of speech communication. However, the teaching was indirect: through reading, reproducing and analyzing a literary text, in accordance with the principle of teaching through fun. It is still necessary to note a circumstance paradoxical at first thought: the utilitarian and pragmatic purposes of these translations reflected Zhukovsky's main aesthetic ideology of the peak of his poetic talent: "Life and Poetry are one."

TI The DHX33 RNA Helicase Promotes mRNA Translation Initiation
SO MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY
AB DEAD/DEAH box RNA helicases play essential roles in numerous RNA metabolic processes, such as mRNA translation, pre-mRNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis, and double-stranded RNA sensing. Herein we show that a recently characterized DEAD/DEAH box RNA helicase, DHX33, promotes mRNA translation initiation. We isolated intact DHX33 protein/RNA complexes in cells and identified several ribosomal proteins, translation factors, and mRNAs. Reduction of DHX33 protein levels markedly reduced polyribosome formation and caused the global inhibition of mRNA translation that was rescued with wild-type DHX33 but not helicase-defective DHX33. Moreover, we observed an accumulation of mRNA complexes with the 80S ribosome in the absence of functional DHX33, consistent with a stalling in initiation, and DHX33 more preferentially promoted structured mRNA translation. We conclude that DHX33 functions to promote elongation-competent 80S ribosome assembly at the late stage of mRNA translation initiation. Our results reveal a newly recognized function of DHX33 in mRNA translation initiation, further solidifying its central role in promoting cell growth and proliferation.

TI Effect of Radio Drama Intervention on Knowledge, Attitude, and
   Practice-Intention of Hypertension Prevention among the Working Class
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH EDUCATION
AB BackgroundKnowledge, attitude, and practice of healthy lifestyles are crucial for the prevention of hypertension. While the use of the mass media as health information sources persists, their use for hypertension prevention interventions among high-risk individuals is arguably low.PurposeTo examine the effect of radio drama intervention on knowledge, attitude, and practice-intention of hypertension prevention among the working class.MethodsA quasi-experiment (pretest-posttest design) among the working class aged 18-64 years who received the radio drama intervention. The paired samples t-test and Cohen's d statistics were adopted to test the hypotheses.ResultsThere were significant differences in the knowledge (t(38) = -3.852, p < .05), attitude (t(38) = -2.719, p < .05) and practice-intention of hypertension prevention (t(38) = -4.958, p < .05) among participants exposed to the radio drama intervention. The effect size of the intervention was large for knowledge (d = 0.961) and practice-intention (d = 1.129) but medium (d = 0.584) for attitude toward hypertension prevention.DiscussionThe radio drama effectively delivered hypertension education messages and improved the knowledge, attitude, and practice-intention of participants toward hypertension prevention.Translation to Health Education Practice: The study recommends the adoption of radio drama to educate the working class and prevent non-communicable diseases such as hypertension by health educators.

TI Respectable Success and Great Moments: The Dramas of Peter Hacks in
   Czech Platforms (1960-1999)
SO ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SLAWISTIK
AB Out of Peter Hacks' dramatic output, 11 plays and one opera libretto (clearly more than in a number of other European countries, e.g. Poland) were performed in Czech theatres. The choice of plays - beginning with the children's play Anabella and the Moon (1960) - represents all major periods of Hacks' playwriting. It is important to note there were no performances during the central phase of the "Golden Sixties", 1964-1968 (Holy 2011); most stagings took place in the years of "normalcy", between 1971 and 1983, partly promoted by officially organized cultural events, first of all the Days of the Theatre of the German Democratic Republic (1978). The success of the stage projects varied between succes d'estime and true theatrical highlights.
   Regardless of performances in many towns throughout Bohemia and Moravia, these forty years of theatre history are almost invisible in Czech publications (handbooks, monographs on the history of leading theatres in different places); Hacks' name is missing in a number of relevant indexes of names. It ought to be remembered Hacks not only approved of the Berlin Wall; he detested the "Prague Spring" and considered the invasion of Prague in August 1968 quite in order.
   Founded on ample source material (theatre programs, reviews, interviews, texts by Hacks and Czech translations), this article endeavours to reconstruct the history of Hacks' plays in Bohemia and Moravia. A specific case are performances of the internationally most successful dramatic monologue Ein Gesprach im Hause Stein uber den abwesenden Herrn von Goethe between 1978 and 1999.

TI THE MEDIATION OF PIERRE LE TOURNEUR IN THE FIRST ITALIAN TRANSLATIONS OF
   SHAKESPEARE (GIUSTINA RENIER MICHIEL AND MICHELE LEONI)
SO ITALICA BELGRADENSIA
AB In the complex milieu of the literary and cultural transformations that characterise the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th, one of the most influential episodes is the translation of Shakespeare's plays. First attempts were different in character and style, and began in the '50s, but they were rarely complete, confining themselves to partial translations of the most famous passages. Only from the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th Italian versions of Shakespeare's works begin to gain a real organic coherence. The first examples are the works of Giustina Renier Michiel and Michele Leoni. The Shakespearean literary experience of the Venetian woman was limited to the choice of three works which had a very restricted distribution and formed a didactic prose work dedicated to her daughters. The paratext, however, proves a worthy critical study by the translator. Leoni's verses, on the other hand, cover a large number of dramas and were widely distributed, but they lack any critical appraisal. Moreover, the choice of poetry obliged the author to imitate the formal restricted neoclassic style depersonalising the original text and completely distorting the first real impact of Shakespeare on the Italian public.

TI Intersemiotic translation. The Isle of the Dead by Arnold Bocklin in
   Different Physical States
SO ACADEMIC JOURNAL OF MODERN PHILOLOGY
AB This article addresses the issue of intersemiotic translation of a painting, taking as the basis the functioning of Arnold Bocklin's work The Isle of the Dead in European culture. The theoretical part of the article relates to the basic components of the theory of intersemiotic translation; in particular, it notes the importance of the difference between the closed system of signs and the possibility of their transposition into other sign systems. This part of the article also discusses the terminology used in intersemiotic translation. Since the creation of the first version of The Isle of the Dead in 1880, this work has been regarded as a masterpiece, though frequently - due to its numerous transpositions into various forms of art - as balancing on the border of kitsch. The descriptive and analytical part of the article, divided into four subsections, refers to the ways the painting has been transposed and has functioned in culture. The first subsection outlines the history of the work's creation and discusses the fundamental changes in its reception, which were influenced by the political and cultural situation in European history. The subsequent parts of the article overview different art forms that have been inspired by Bocklin's painting thus far. Examples of plastic art include copies, reproductions, and art forms that rupture the border between the image and the word (such as comic books) as well as three-dimensional realizations (such as theatrical sceneries and architectural designs). Examples of works of literature that were inspired by Bocklin's painting include elements of prose, poetry, and drama (such as works by Strindberg, Aragon, and Tetmajer), whereas the inspirations found in music include musical poems composed by Rachmaninoff and others. Finally, this paper presents an analysis of film productions that have made reference to The Isle of the Dead, ranging from works created in the 1940's to a commercial movie made in 2013.

TI English Reception of Nikolai Gogol's Comedy The Government Inspector in
   Theatrical Translation Interpretation by Peter Raby and Michael Langham
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
AB The article deals with the adapted translation of the comedy The Government Inspector by Nikolai Gogol made in 1967 for production in Canada (and then in America). The aim of the study is to examine the "theatrical translation interpretation" of the play, i.e., the interpretation that the play receives as a result of a translation prepared specifically for the stage, its reception in the context of the host culture, of work on it by the author of the adaptation, and by the director when embodying the text on stage. The research methodology is based on the biographical method, content analysis, contextual analysis, as well as the comparative method. The relevance of Gogol's play to the inhabitants of Canada could partly be explained by the narrow-minded provincialism of Canadian society. Canada could also be influenced by a similar situation in America, where rebellious sentiments were growing due to the dominance of bourgeois values that depersonalize a person, due to the cult of things and philistine "happiness". This led to the predominance of modernist sentiments in American society: to pessimism and the desire of young people to leave for other realities. In Canadian literature, surrealist tendencies were beginning to intensify at this time. Presumably, it was the cultural environment that influenced the authors' interpretation of all the characters as suffering escapists who seek to hide from the ugly reality in dreams of an idealized life. The heroes' values, according to Raby and Langham, make them victims of "poshlost' ", behind which there is a fear of reality. "Poshlost' ", on the other hand, is the product of bourgeois values that depersonalize people. The reality of the comedy is interpreted as dreamlike, which indicates a surreal aesthetic, but the essence of the play is seen by the creators of the production in those moments when reality manages to break through. Here, there is a similarity with the "Theater of Cruelty" conception by A. Artaud. The exposure of everyday reality in order to overcome the "fear of life" and the "poshlost' " that binds people's souls can be considered as the sense of adaptation. Undoubtedly, the audience does not get the opportunity to meet the "terrible reality" in full, but the appeal of the Mayor partly makes them participants of the events, and, therefore, understanding the horror of "poshlost' " is still possible. It can also be noted that the structure of the play is somewhat transformed in the adaptation: it becomes more chaotic and simplified, which presumably correlates with the state of the 20th-century culture. This interpretation reveals the meanings that potentially exist in comedy, and can serve as an illustration of why Gogol's works do not lose their relevance.

TI From 'Scottish' Play to Japanese Film: Kurosawa's Throne of Blood
SO ARTS
AB Shakespeare's plays have become the subject of filmic remakes, as well as the source for others' plot lines. This transfer of Shakespeare's plays to film presents a challenge to filmmakers' auterial ingenuity: Is a film director more challenged when producing a Shakespearean play than the stage director? Does having auterial ingenuity imply that the film-maker is somehow freer than the director of a play to change a Shakespearean text? Does this allow for the language of the plays to be changed-not just translated from English to Japanese, for example, but to be updated, edited, abridged, ignored for a large part? For some scholars, this last is more expropriation than pure Shakespeare on screen and under this category we might find Kurosawa's Throne of Blood (Kumonosu-jo 1957), the subject of this essay. Here, I explore how this difficult tale was translated into a Japanese context, a society mistakenly assumed to be free of Christian notions of guilt, through the transcultural move of referring to Noh theatre, aligning the story with these Buddhist morality plays. In this manner Kurosawa found a point of commonality between Japan and the West when it came to stories of violence, guilt, and the problem of redemption.

TI Fansub Dreaming on ViKi "Don't Just Watch But Help When You Are Free"
SO TRANSLATOR
AB Fan subtitling, or 'fansubbing', is a heterogeneous and rapidly growing field of amateur translation exhibiting a number of traits that have so far been overlooked by scholars of audiovisual translation. Current research on fansubbing is broadened by examining this phenomenon beyond the strictures of anime sub-culture alone, drawing on the counter example of Internet start-up company ViKi and exploring the gaps in mainstream subtitling that fansubbing both exposes and fills. The team of volunteer translators working for ViKi re-animates notions of global diversity by capitalizing on the affordances of new technologies and collective intelligence to break down the national and linguistic hierarchies that dominate contemporary media and professional audiovisual translation. Despite a largely conservative 'look and feel' and signs of increasing commercialization, ViKi's fansubbing model makes an important contribution to the internationalization of audiovisual translation practices, bringing programs from small-language communities to diverse audiences across the globe. The paper-further considers the extent to which the legalization of ViKi's fansubbing activity empowers fans to bring about real change in the media marketplace.

SO BULLETIN OF HISPANIC STUDIES
AB Greece is a case particularly worthy of attention within the panorama of Federico Garcia Lorca's worldwide reception. In comparison to other countries, Lorca's presence in Greece has remained uninterrupted since his first appearance and remains current, with new translations, rewritings, adaptations, and stagings of his plays continually being produced. Lorca has also spurred a wide range of creative responses inspired by his life and death such as essays, music, poetry, and dramas. He has also stimulated debates over aesthetic, literary, cultural, ideological and political issues, and has thus become indissolubly bound to the Greek cultural environment both as a Greek and a Spanish icon. This paper examines the ways Lorca has been received and treated in Greece in relation to the cultural and historical context.

TI THE SONG IN IL GUARANY: INTERSEMIOTIC TRANSLATION OF DE NOVEL TO THE
   OPERA
SO REVELL-REVISTA DE ESTUDOS LITERARIOS DA UEMS
AB The article analyzes the intersemiotic translation of the novel O Guarani, by Jos?? de Alencar, into the opera by Carlos Gomes, Il Guarany, in relation to the songs, specifically the arias that come to life in the voices of Peri and Ceci, the main characters. The methodology consists of the presentation of the lyrics of the songs in the libretto, analyzing how the texts, in the song and in the novel, express the authors' ideas using different sign systems. It is observed that the text of the song, designed to be translated into rhythm, voice, drama and music, in an intersemiosis between the sign systems that are part of the opera, aims to achieve the expression of the author's ideas and provoke responses in the receiver similar to those obtained by the text of the novel, or even more intense, considering that music can increase the individual's sensitivity. It is concluded that, as a multi-signal system, the reception of the song requires the participation of multiple senses, a process that is impregnated with the subjectivity of the author/creator and the receiver, as well as conforming aspects of the environment where the work takes place. Performance is highlighted as essential in the realization of the songbook idea, since, at each performance, there will be a new song.

TI User-Oriented EFL Speaking through Application and Exercise: Instant
   Speech Translation and Shadowing in Authentic Context
SO EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY
AB In this study, an application (app) called ezTranslate was developed to aid English as foreign language (EFL) learning by assigning lessons that adapt to students' interests, in order to motivate them to engage concurrently in physical activity in a real context. ezTranslate was developed by combining state-of-the-art technologies-automatic speech recognition and a cloud translation service, which permit effortless language translation. ezTranslate also offers user-oriented, self-speaking practice opportunities via its speech shadowing function. This app is designed (1) as an effective support tool for EFL speaking in authentic contexts and (2) to engage students in exercise as they walk in their environment. Results suggest that using ezTranslate in familiar situations significantly promotes student cooperation, as evidenced by their increased listening and speaking. Furthermore, there were significant differences in English speaking performance and homework aptitude in participants when using ezTranslate with or without authentic contexts. Indeed, this study's findings emphasize the importance of authentic support for EFL speaking; namely, students' interests. The familiarity and fascination of students with real contexts can motivate them to communicate in English better and more frequently. As for the effect of exercise on EFL learning, statistical analysis revealed that the more steps students take, the more they practice speaking English. These results are very promising. Creating an interactive medium in which students not only acquire knowledge but also move their bodies promotes brain and body activity vital to their overall health. In the near future, we plan to extend activity design, executing authentic drama-play to sustain effective, healthy EFL learning.

This book evaluates objectively, impartially, and thoroughly Albee's dramatic conception and his talent as a director. In doing so, it highlights four combinations, namely, the combination of drama writing and theatre director, the combination of works' studies and biography, the combination of performance observation and backstage interviews, and the combination of literary notes and pictorial illustrations,thus opening new lines of investigating Albee. This book has four enlightenments for Albee study in China: to promote the translation work of Albee's drama, to increase the monographic studies of Albee's drama, to encourage the stage performance of Albee's drama and to preserve the performance data and performance reviews.

TI IVAN TURGENEV - THE READER OF SHAKESPEARE'S PREDECESSORS BY LUDWIG TIECK
   (BASED ON TURGENEV'S FAMILY LIBRARY MATERIALS)
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
AB The article focuses on the issue of an essential representation of Shakespearean art in Ivan Turgenev's literary works. The research attention aims at the writer's life in Berlin. This was an important period of Turgenev's life characterized by the formation of his ideological and aesthetic views on Shakespeare's creative system. During Turgenev's education abroad, he was engaged in an active study of Hegel's Encyclopaedia and captivated by the literary findings of the "Great Bard". One of the key parts of this process is a thoughtful attention to the common factors of the development of the Elizabethan theatre. Turgenev adopted the history of the English theater development and formation deeply and fundamentally, and for the contemporaries, he became a distinguished specialist in this field. Turgenev was fully inspired with the Old English plays and special historical works, stored in a separate quality in the library of Turgenev's family estate in Spasskoye. The writer was especially interested in the two-volume Shakespeare's Predecessors (Shakespeares Vorschule, 1823-1829). Ludwig Tieck, a preeminent member of Jena Romanticism, prepared this edition. By being an engaged Romanticist, he made a contribution to Shakespearean romantic culture formation in Germany. By continuing August Schlegel's translation and edition of the complete Shakespearean heritage, Ludwig Tieck at the same time started to collect and publish the first tentative dramas of his predecessor and contemporaries. While reading Shakespeare's Predecessors, the Russian writer carefully focused on the foreword of the first volume - a kind of an aesthetic manifesto of the German culture. In the manifesto, the Romanticist tried to perform plainly and simply the early stage of the English drama development. Turgenev's six-page opening chapter has several pencil notes of different types: handwritings, marks, marginal and in-text lines. The writer's marginal notes allow characterising adequately his special interest to the English theater at the turn of the 17th century and the uniqueness of his aesthetic view of Shakespeare's creative genius. Turgenev highlighted the most important points for him: the drama folk roots and the influence of Ancient culture, the role of usualness (everyday culture) and heroic (history) in the literary artwork, their interpenetration, the language and style uniqueness, the principles of dramatic nature. These and other elements further influenced Turgenev by making him think deeply in the frame of his own Shakespearean literary work.

TI Translation and the representation of thought: The case of Herta Muller
SO LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE
AB A number of recent studies consider how the style of a text is recreated by a translator, and what issues this raises for the study of the translated text and its reception, and for both stylistics and translation studies more generally. But the changes that translation makes to perspective and structures of narrative in the text have rarely been studied. In this article I suggest how one might consider changes of this nature that have come about when the works of the Nobel-Prize-winning German-Romanian writer Herta Muller were translated into English, and the possible effects of such changes on the construction of fictional minds by the English reader. These changes are of particular importance in this case because the novels deal with repression of various types - in the community and the family, by the state - and focus especially on the disjunction between thinking and speaking, and the uncertainty of what others are thinking. Considering how specific aspects of narrative perspective change when these novels are translated raises potentially interesting questions both for the study of translation and for the study of narrative.

TI 'It is Germany where he Truly Lives': Nazi Claims on Shakespearean Drama
SO NEW THEATRE QUARTERLY
AB That the Nazis tried to claim Shakespeare as a Germanic playwright has been well documented, but recently theatre historians have claimed that their 'success' was rather limited. Instead, commentators have asserted that plays such as Othello, Antony and Cleopatra, and The Merchant of Venice offended National Socialist precepts and were sidelined. This article attempts a re-evaluation and shows that the effect of the Nazi claims on Shakespeare was substantial, and the official efforts that went into realizing these in productions were considerable. It is also argued that the Nazis established a particular reading of Shakespeare, which lasted well into the 1960s and dominated the aesthetics of West German productions of his drama. Anselm Heinrich is Lecturer and Head of Theatre Studies at the University of Glasgow. He is the author of Entertainment, Education, Propaganda: Regional Theatres in Germany and Britain Between 1918 and 1945 (2007), and has co-edited a collection of essays on Ruskin, the Theatre, and Victorian Visual Culture (2009). His new monograph on theatre in Westphalia and Yorkshire for the German publishers Schoeningh is forthcoming.

TI Bureaucratic politics and the translation of movement agendas
SO GOVERNANCE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLICY ADMINISTRATION AND
   INSTITUTIONS
AB Research on social movement outcomes focuses on the publicly visible stages of government policymaking. It rarely opens the black box of government's translation of movement demands beyond the agenda-setting stage and before their materialization into legislative bills. Using a bureaucratic politics perspective, we suggest that bureaucrats play a central role in translating movement agendas into concrete problems and policy solutions, which they tend to link with their bureaus' missions and existing programs. We further suggest that relative consensus among bureaucrats when coupled with politicians' disinclination to intervene in the translation process tends to advantage conservative interpretations of movement agendas. Conversely, interbureau confrontation and political intervention are associated with more radical policy responses. Empirically, we examine the responses of the Israeli government to the large-scale mobilization, in 2011, surrounding the rising costs of housing and living. We build on archival research and interviews with senior bureaucrats located in 11 central-government ministries.

   TRANSLATION OF GOETHE'S FAUST ATTRIBUTED TO SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE
SO PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS
AB This article disputes the stylometric attribution of an anonymous English 1821 translation of Goethe's German verse drama Faust to the poet and critic Samuel Taylor Coleridge. The translation was compared to four known Coleridgean dramas, two of which were translations from German. Evidence challenging Coleridge's authorship came from words used proportionally more often by Coleridge, words used proportionally more often by the unknown translator, differential employment of parallel word forms ("O" and "hath" for Coleridge, "oh" and "has" for the translator), and differences in the undertones of the two vocabularies, as measured by the Dictionary of Affect in Language (Coleridge's undertones were less pleasant and more abstract). Some problems with the stylometry of the challenged attribution to Coleridge are noted.

TI Aesthetic Radicalism: Langston Hughes's Lost Translation of Federico
   Garcia Lorca's Bodas de sangre/Blood Wedding
SO MODERN DRAMA
AB Langston Hughes's long-lost translation of Federico Garcia Lorca's play Bodas de sangre / Blood Wedding (1933) - Fate at the Wedding (1938) - demonstrates a synchronicity between two 1930s aesthetic radicals who shared a transnational perspective. Through his act of translation, Hughes not only perpetuates and amplifies Lorca's concern with social issues but he uses his own version of Lorca's total theatre, with its graphic and sound effects, to deploy a unique blend of avant-garde European and fringe modernist styles of the Latin American and Caribbean worlds he knew intimately. Hughes's act of translation opens a politicized space in the play that reveals his own aesthetic project, wrought in terms of colour, vernacular discourse, and a hybrid notion of American musicality and culture. He thus melds his subversive message with Lorca's own and highlights the latent radicalism of the Spanish playwright's aesthetics and politics. At a time when he was intensely politicized and often didactic in his writings on race and class oppression, Hughes chooses to infuse the experimental style of Lorca's play with political potentiality, reading it as an internationalist study of the mechanics of oppression, without reducing it to a single political or racial reading.

TI Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A and its posttranslational
   modifications play an important role in proliferation and potentially in
   differentiation of the human enteric protozoan parasite Entamoeba
   histolytica
SO PLOS PATHOGENS
AB The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) is a highly conserved protein and is essential in all eukaryotes. However, the specific roles of eIF5A in translation and in other biological processes remain elusive. In the present study, we described the role of eIF5A, its posttranslational modifications (PTM), and the biosynthetic pathway needed for the PTM in Entamoeba histolytica, the protozoan parasite responsible for amoebic dysentery and liver abscess in humans. E. histolytica encodes two isotypes of eIF5A and two isotypes of enzymes, deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS), responsible for their PTM. Both of the two eIF5A isotypes are functional, whereas only one DHS (EhDHS1, but not EhDHS2), is catalytically active. The DHS activity increased similar to 2000-fold when EhDHS1 was co-expressed with EhDHS2 in Escherichia coli, suggesting that the formation of a heteromeric complex is needed for full enzymatic activity. Both EhDHS1 and 2 genes were required for in vitro growth of E. histolytica trophozoites, indicated by small antisense RNA-mediated gene silencing. In trophozoites, only eIF5A2, but not eIF5A1, gene was actively transcribed. Gene silencing of eIF5A2 caused compensatory induction of expression of eIF5A1 gene, suggesting interchangeable role of the two eIF5A isotypes and also reinforcing the importance of eIF5As for parasite proliferation and survival. Furthermore, using a sibling species, Entamoeba invadens, we found that eIF5A1 gene was upregulated during excystation, while eIF5A2 was downregulated, suggesting that eIF5A1 gene plays an important role during differentiation. Taken together, these results have underscored the essentiality of eIF5A and DHS, for proliferation and potentially in the differentiation of this parasite, and suggest that the hypusination associated pathway represents a novel rational target for drug development against amebiasis.
   Author summary
   Eukaryotic initiation factor 5A is a ubiquitous protein that is essential for cell proliferation. We examined the maturation, regulation, and function of eIF5A in E. histolytica. We found by small antisense RNA-mediated gene silencing that EhDHS1/2 and EheIF5A2 are essential for growth of E. histolytica trophozoites. We further found that only one of two isotypes of eIF5A, EheIF5A2, was constitutively expressed in the trophozoite stage and silencing of EheIF5A2 gene caused overexpression of the other eIF5A isotype (EheIF5A1) to partially rescue the growth defect in this parasite. Furthermore, we found that transcription of eIF5A1 gene was stage-specifically upregulated during excystation in E. invadens. Taken together, we have demonstrated for the first time that the two eIF5As play important and distinct roles in Entamoeba biology. This study has also provided an answer to a long-standing conundrum on the biological importance of polyamines: spermidine is needed for eIF5A hypusination, which is essential for protein translation in Entamoeba. Our work will provide an insight into the physiological significance of eIF5A and its post-translational modifications in other pathogenic eukaryotes and potentially lead to the formulation of control measures against parasitic diseases.

TI Genome-wide translation control analysis of developing human neurons
SO MOLECULAR BRAIN
AB During neuronal differentiation, neuroprogenitor cells become polarized, change shape, extend axons, and form complex dendritic trees. While growing, axons are guided by molecular cues to their final destination, where they establish synaptic connections with other neuronal cells. Several layers of regulation are integrated to control neuronal development properly. Although control of mRNA translation plays an essential role in mammalian gene expression, how it contributes temporarily to the modulation of later stages of neuronal differentiation remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated how translation control affects pathways and processes essential for neuronal maturation, using H9-derived human neuro progenitor cells differentiated into neurons as a model. Through Ribosome Profiling (Riboseq) combined with RNA sequencing (RNAseq) analysis, we found that translation control regulates the expression of critical hub genes. Fundamental synaptic vesicle secretion genes belonging to SNARE complex, Rab family members, and vesicle acidification ATPases are strongly translationally regulated in developing neurons. Translational control also participates in neuronal metabolism modulation, particularly affecting genes involved in the TCA cycle and glutamate synthesis/catabolism. Importantly, we found translation regulation of several critical genes with fundamental roles regulating actin and microtubule cytoskeleton pathways, critical to neurite generation, spine formation, axon guidance, and circuit formation. Our results show that translational control dynamically integrates important signals in neurons, regulating several aspects of its development and biology.

TI Puf Mediates Translation Repression of Transmission-Blocking Vaccine
   Candidates in Malaria Parasites
SO PLOS PATHOGENS
AB Translational control of gene expression plays an essential role in development. In malaria parasites, translational regulation is critical during the development of specialized transition stages between the vertebrate host and mosquito vector. Here we show that a Pumilio/FBF (Puf) family RNA-binding protein, PfPuf2, is required for the translation repression of a number of transcripts in gametocytes including two genes encoding the transmission-blocking vaccine candidates Pfs25 and Pfs28. Whereas studies to date support a paradigm of Puf-mediated translation regulation through 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of target mRNAs, this study, for the first time, identifies a functional Puf-binding element (PBE) in the 5'UTR of pfs25. We provide both in vitro and in vivo evidence to demonstrate that PfPuf2 binds to the PBEs in pfs25 and pfs28 to mediate translation repression. This finding provides a renewed view of Pufs as versatile translation regulators and sheds light on their functions in the development of lower branches of eukaryotes.

SO CRITICAL PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Persons living with dementia and their carers experience stigma. Stigma intensifies social exclusion and threatens health and well-being. Decreasing stigma associated with dementia is a public health priority across national and international settings and is a key component of National Dementia Strategies. Research-based drama is an effective public health strategy for reducing stigma and enhancing well-being. In this article we focus on survey data from an evaluation of a research-based drama called Cracked: new light on dementia. Our analysis illustrates the effectiveness of Cracked in reducing stigma by: decreasing health care practitioners' and family carers' prejudice, fostering critical reflection about relational practices, and fostering a commitment to individual and collective action to address stigma. Cracked is well-positioned to respond to urgent calls for culture change, which include reducing societal misconceptions and stereotypes around dementia and promoting inclusive and meaningful engagement of persons living with dementia across all levels of society.

   School Writers in Warsaw, Poland
SO JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE AND LITERACY EDUCATION
AB The purpose of this six-week, naturalistic inquiry study was to explore how middle school students at an international school in Warsaw, Poland experienced embodied literacies in their drama elective and their experience with revision through students' creations of performance and puppetry vignettes that represented their fictional stories. This study centered on the following research questions: 1) How does drama stimulate revision in writing? and 2) How do students describe their experience with drama in the writing process? Multiple data were collected: writing drafts with revisions, photos, interviews, performance and rehearsal videos, and reflections. The constant comparative method was used to analyze and triangulate the data. Additionally, digital images were used to generate a multimodal analytic method that implemented a Semiotic Photo Response Protocol. Analyses of data revealed that acting out their writing stimulated additional ideas for students' stories, especially in how students embodied their stories. However, some students had concerns and difficulty in translating their flash fiction pieces from narrative to script format. Data analysis also demonstrated how aesthetics played a role in the translation of content from writing to drama, and how some students had challenges in collaborating with their performance groups but not during their writing groups.

TI Living between languages: The politics of translation in Leila
   Aboulela's Minaret and Xiaolu Guo's A Concise Chinese-English Dictionary
   for Lovers
SO JOURNAL OF COMMONWEALTH LITERATURE
AB This essay examines the notion of "translational writing" - literary texts which bear the traces of multiple languages, foregrounding and dramatizing the processes of translation of which they are both product and representation - through detailed examination of two recent novels set in London: Leila Aboulela's Minaret (2005), and Xiaolu Guo's A Concise Chinese-English Dictionary for Lovers (2007). Both novels are narrated by their female protagonists, whose movement between linguistic planes defines a distinctively feminized, translingual identity. Each works to destabilize the assumed relationship between language and national belonging, in part by recasting London as a space of translation: a city of immigrants defined by its polyglossia, and a node in a deterritorialized transnational linguistic order. Yet, while both novels explore the possibilities, risks, and limitations of a life lived between languages, they also demonstrate that translational literature, like translation theory, offers no consensus on the practice of translation. Their divergent conclusions - about the relationship between languages, about the nature and purposes of translation, about the connections between language and truth - reveal much about the complexities of translational writing.

TI CircRNAs: potency of protein translation and feasibility of novel
   biomarkers and therapeutic targets for head and neck cancers
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH
AB Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a new star noncoding RNA (ncRNA), show stability, conservation, abundance, and tissue and stage specificity. They act as key regulators of biological processes. They target the mRNAs of many other different genes or signaling pathways, and closely link associated genes into regulatory networks. Growing evidence has demonstrated that circRNAs may play an important role in the carcinogenesis, progression and chemoradiation resistance of many cancers including head and neck cancers (HNC). CircRNA, like other ncRNA, such as miRNA, lncRNA, usually is considered to be non-protein coding transcript. However, recent studies indicated that abnormal translation of circRNAs may be involved in human diseases. In this review, we collected the origin, classification, characteristics, function of circRNAs, exosmal circRNAs, and then synthesize current study results to highlight aberration of circRNAs in various types of HNC, and try to clarify the molecular mechanisms of circRNAs affecting the pathogenesis and progression of HNC, as well as pay particular attention to provide a new avenue to the diagnosis and treatment strategy for HNC.

TI A Woman's Voice in the Poetics of Neoclassical Tragedy: Margarita
   Hickey's "Preface" to her Translation of Racine's Andromaque (1789)
SO REVISTA DE LITERATURA
AB In 1789, Margarita Hickey published the first volume of Poesias varias, sagradas, morales y profanas o amorosas, including her translation of Racine's Andromaque (1667). With Racine's version, Hickey became the first Spanish female writer interested in translating Neoclassical tragedy, as well as the only female who dared to translate the dramatic work of this reputed French playwright into our language. In addition, Hickey's work opens with an interesting preface in which the author reflects on different aspects related to the Neoclassical concept of tragedy and the purpose of drama. This paper analyses Margarita Hickey's contribution to turn-of-the-century theoretical discourse on tragedy, when the Neoclassical reformism has to coexist, not without some tension, with a conception of theater closer to the popular taste and more open to new dramatic models.

TI Literature ad usum delphini: Jose de Viera y Clavijo and his translation
   of the stories for children by Arnaud Berquin
SO CEDILLE-REVISTA DE ESTUDIOS FRANCESES
AB Jose de Viera y Clavijo (Los Realejos, Tenerife, 1731 Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, 1813) is the author of the first translation into Spanish, made in 1784, of a selection of the tales and dramas written for children published by Arnaud Berquin (Bordeaux, 1747-Paris, 1791) in Eami des enfants, a mensile publication that has got twelfe numbers between 1782 and 1783, and that were, almost the whole collection, translations of German, Dutch and English authors, extracted from publications as Kleine Kinderbibliothek (1779-1784), by Campe, or Der Kinderfreund (1776-1782), by Christian Felix Weisse, betwenn others. The thanslations/adaptationes made by Arnaud Berquin were very free, and they show an evident accomodation to the french culture and to the enlightenment philosophy of this author. No-wadays, the enligtenment age author Viera y Clavijo, an advanted author and a expert and prolific translator, took many liberties in translating the Berquin's Tales. In this article, are shown some of the important changes introduced by the the spanish translator in his versions and they are explained in the cultural and ideological context of the Spain in the 18th century.

TI Differential Role for Host Translation Factors in Host and Viral Protein
   Synthesis during Human Cytomegalovirus Infection
SO JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
AB The host eIF4F translation initiation complex plays a critical role the translation of capped mRNAs. Although human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection increases the abundance and activity of the host eIF4F complex, the requirement for eIF4F components in HCMV replication and mRNA translation has not been directly tested. In this study, we found that decreasing the abundance or activity of eIF4F from the start of infection inhibits HCMV replication. However, as infection progresses, viral mRNA translation and replication becomes increasingly resistant to eIF4F inhibition. During the late stage of infection the association of representative immediate-early, early, and late mRNAs with polysomes was not affected by eIF4F disruption. In contrast, eIF4F inhibition decreased the translation of representative host eIF4F-dependent mRNAs during the late stage of infection. A global analysis of the translation efficiency of HCMV mRNAs during the late stage of infection found that eIF4F disruption had a minimal impact on the association of HCMV mRNAs with polysomes but significantly diminished the translation efficiency of eIF4F-dependent host transcripts. Together, our data show that the translation of host eIF4F-dependent mRNAs remains dependent on eIF4F activity during HCMV infection. However, during the late stage of infection the translation efficiency of viral mRNAs does not correlate with the abundance or activity of the host eIF4F complex.

TI Stress as a Suprasegmental Phonological Shift in Translation: A New
   Category of Linguistic Shifts
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED LINGUISTICS
AB This study relies on a contrastive analysis to underscore the functions of stress as a shift in translation, especially when phonological specifications can have an impact on translation. In the original model of translation shifts proposed by Catford, only segmental linguistic elements are taken into consideration, while the model totally ignores stress as a supra-segmental linguistic element. Including stress within the analytic procedures of the model can bring about a new type of shift. This implies that Catford's categorization of shifts must be developed in order to increase its applicability, especially when phonological specifications in the source text can have an impact on grammar and lexical items in the target text. As a result of the inclusion of stress into Catford's original mode, a revised version of the translation shift model is suggested. The study further emphasizes the various dimensions of stress and the functions it can have in oral aspects of translation and drama translation.

TI Se te ha ido la olla? or voce e maluco? vs. are you (fucking) nuts? The
   translation of English idioms in internet TV series
SO LENGUA Y HABLA
AB Over recent years, internet TV series have grown in popularity to become one of the audiovisual products with the highest audiences worldwide. The Covid-19 crisis, with long quarantines and other limitations on movement, has further increased their success during 2020-21. English is by far the most common language for such series, which are typically offered to non anglophone viewers in translated format, with either subtitles or dubbing. One of the main challenges in translation here concerns the use of IDIOMS, since these do not always have a fixed equivalent in the target language.
   Taking as a starting point a corpus of four drama series from Netflix and Amazon Prime, this study considers the metaphorical dimension of the idioms in original TV series in English and subtitles of these in Spanish and Portuguese. The aim is to analyze the strategies used in the translation process, and to look at the differences between the original dialogues and the translated subtitles from a metaphorical and idiomatic point of view. In the case of both Spanish and Portuguese, the analysis will consider both European and American varieties of the languages. The data are described from a cognitive and contrastive perspective, according to the methodology developed by Labarta Postigo (2020).
   The results of the analysis show a general trend towards the reduction of metaphorical expressions in the translated subtitles. Contrastive analysis reveals that there are fewer differences between translations to the two languages, Spanish and Portuguese, than between varieties of the same language.

TI The eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A regulation of actin
   stress fibers is important for infectious RSV production
SO VIROLOGY JOURNAL
AB Cellular protein eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) is an actin binding protein that plays a role in the formation of filamentous actin (F-actin) bundles. F-Actin regulates multiple stages of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) replication including assembly and budding. Our previous study demonstrated that eEF1A knock-down significantly reduced RSV replication. Here we investigated if the eEF1A function in actin bundle formation was important for RSV replication and release. To investigate this, eEF1A function was impaired in HEp-2 cells by either knock-down of eEF1A with siRNA, or treatment with an eEF1A inhibitor, didemnin B (Did B). Cell staining and confocal microscopy analysis showed that both eEF1A knock-down and treatment with Did B resulted in disruption of cellular stress fiber formation and elevated accumulation of F-actin near the plasma membrane. When treated cells were then infected with RSV, there was also reduced formation of virus-induced cellular filopodia. Did B treatment, similarly to eEF1A knock-down, reduced the release of infectious RSV, but unlike eEF1A knock-down, did not significantly affect RSV genome replication. The lower infectious virus production in Did B treated cells also reduced RSV-induced cell death. In conclusion, the cellular factor eEF1A plays an important role in the regulation of F-actin stress fiber formation required for RSV assembly and release.

TI Navigating the labyrinth from performability to performativity: the
   creation of a Beijing Linda Loman as a case in point
SO PERSPECTIVES-STUDIES IN TRANSLATION THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB This article follows a performability-performativity conceptual thread in its attempt to decipher how a character can be recreated on stage via translation. Using the creation of Linda Loman in Beijing People's Art Theatre's 1983 production of Death of a Salesman as a case in point, it starts with a comparative analysis of what was considered (un-)performable from the points of view of the director and the actress playing the role, while also looking for performative undercurrents, which often manifest as self-performing or self-reinforcing speech acts. The investigation ends with an exploration of the interplay between the extra-textual performatives and the translation, a performative force in itself. By demonstrating how the Beijing iteration of Linda Loman was constructed from the tensions and interactions between many performative forces, including gender, authorship, theatrical training and translation, this article not only explores the creative process of translation theatre as complex and dynamic, but also proves the mechanisms of that process.

TI Fan activism sustained and challenged: participatory culture in Chinese
   online translation communities
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION
AB Henry Jenkins, in Convergence Culture, argues that [p]opular culture may be preparing the way for a more meaningful public culture. This article examines this argument in the context of online translation communities in China, which originated from fan groups interested in foreign comics, games, movies, and television dramas. Drawing on evidence collected through participant observation and 23 in-depth interviews, this article first reviews the historical development and the structural layout of such online translation communities. It then focuses on the motivations of their members to contribute to the translation tasks, which show that personal interests speak louder than collective goals. Finally, it analyzes how the collaboration structure, mindset of collaboration, skills, and sense of agency are transferred from translating entertainment content to civic education content (i.e. open courses). Participatory culture fostered through fan activities is found to be transferred into civic engagement; however, the transfer between fan activism and political participation is yet to be seen.

TI Whither Theatricality? Toward Traditional Chinese Drama and Theater
   (Xiqu ??) as World Theater
SO JOURNAL OF CHINESE LITERATURE AND CULTURE
AB The essay provides a brief review of how certain approaches to theatricality evolved in response to particular theatrical archives or repertoires in non-Chinese contexts. It then con-siders a number of recent studies of Chinese drama and theater in light of the following issues: the nature of theatrical language, the emergence and uses of fictionality, and the reconstruction of performance aesthetics. In focusing on these particular areas, the essay seeks to show how such research can contribute toward countering entrenched characterizations of xiqu as "non-drama," "spectacle," or "pure heritage." The final section of the article proposes some future avenues of inquiry in order to deepen the dialogue between Sinology and theater studies while providing tools for sustaining the practice of xiqu and fostering broader appreciation of traditional Chinese theater in Anglophone, Chinese-speaking, and other contexts.

Punitha describes how she embarked on a career as a translator through an English version of U.R. Ananthamurthy's novel Bharathipura and assesses her motivation for translating Dalit literature into English from regional Indian languages such as Kannada. She discusses her recent translation of Lakshman's Samboli! (2018), which portrays the experiences of Madigas, who, in Punitha's words, are considered "the lowest of the low castes in Karnataka". Punitha reflects on the uses and difficulties of explanatory "interpolation" and the ways in which she engages with the language, content, aesthetics, and affect of the source text. She comments on her professional relationship with the authors, Lakshman and U.R. Ananthamurthy, and also suggests how the idea of "Dalit consciousness" may be perceived differently by men and women.

AB The paper describes the most important stages of all well-known transla-tions of Dostoevsky's novel Crime and Punishment (1866) in German language published from 1882 to 1994, which played a special role in Dostoevsky's Cultural Reception in Germany and in Europe. The article analyzes the reasons for the multiplicity of translation interpretations of the novel Crime and Punishment in German. The role of translators, publishing houses and Complete Works of Dostoevsky are considered in detail. The second article of the series presents a complete review of the currently known translations of the novel by F.M. Dostoevsky Crime and Punishment into German, made from the 1910s to the present. For the first time, a comprehensive analysis of the role of projects of publishing Complete Works of Dostoevsky by Inzel and Aufbau is presented. The translations are chronologically tabulated. All research material allowed to explain the reasons for the appearance of new translations of the novel in Germany (G. Roel, A.S. Eliasberg, R. Hoffmann, M. und R. Breuer, S. Geier). The translations of the novel Crime and Punishment prepared by G. Roel (1912), A.S. Eliasberg (1921), R. Hoffmann (1960) and S. Geier (1993) became facts of German culture. The multiplicity of translations and the details of their appearance described in the article indicate the influence of certain political and cultural events in Germany on the popularity of the novel Crime and Punishment and the reception of Dostoevsky's work in German culture.

TI Knowledge Translation in Men's Health Research: Development and Delivery
   of Content for Use Online
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB Background: Men can be hard to reach with face-to-face health-related information, while increasingly, research shows that they are seeking health information from online sources. Recognizing this trend, there is merit in developing innovative online knowledge translation (KT) strategies capable of translating research on men's health into engaging health promotion materials. While the concept of KT has become a new mantra for researchers wishing to bridge the gap between research evidence and improved health outcomes, little is written about the process, necessary skills, and best practices by which researchers can develop online knowledge translation.
   Objective: Our aim was to illustrate some of the processes and challenges involved in, and potential value of, developing research knowledge online to promote men's health.
   Methods: We present experiences of KT across two case studies of men's health. First, we describe a study that uses interactive Web apps to translate knowledge relating to Canadian men's depression. Through a range of mechanisms, study findings were repackaged with the explicit aim of raising awareness and reducing the stigma associated with men's depression and/or help-seeking. Second, we describe an educational resource for teenage men about unintended pregnancy, developed for delivery in the formal Relationship and Sexuality Education school curricula of Ireland, Northern Ireland (United Kingdom), and South Australia. The intervention is based around a Web-based interactive film drama entitled "If I Were Jack".
   Results: For each case study, we describe the KT process and strategies that aided development of credible and well-received online content focused on men's health promotion. In both case studies, the original research generated the inspiration for the interactive online content and the core development strategy was working with a multidisciplinary team to develop this material through arts-based approaches. In both cases also, there is an acknowledgment of the need for gender and culturally sensitive information. Both aimed to engage men by disrupting stereotypes about men, while simultaneously addressing men through authentic voices and faces. Finally, in both case studies we draw attention to the need to think beyond placement of content online to delivery to target audiences from the outset.
   Conclusions: The case studies highlight some of the new skills required by academics in the emerging paradigm of translational research and contribute to the nascent literature on KT. Our approach to online KT was to go beyond dissemination and diffusion to actively repackage research knowledge through arts-based approaches (videos and film scripts) as health promotion tools, with optimal appeal, to target male audiences. Our findings highlight the importance of developing a multidisciplinary team to inform the design of content, the importance of adaptation to context, both in terms of the national implementation context and consideration of gender-specific needs, and an integrated implementation and evaluation framework in all KT work.

TI The Arabidopsis Mitochondrial Pseudouridine Synthase Homolog FCS1 Plays
   Critical Roles in Plant Development
SO PLANT AND CELL PHYSIOLOGY
AB As the most abundant RNA modification, pseudouridylation has been shown to play critical roles in Escherichia coli, yeast and humans. However, its function in plants is still unclear. Here, we characterized leaf curly and small 1 (FCS1), which encodes a pseudouridine synthase in Arabidopsis. fcs1 mutants exhibited severe defects in plant growth, such as delayed development and reduced fertility, and were significantly smaller than the wild type at different developmental stages. FCS1 protein is localized in the mitochondrion. The absence of FCS1 significantly reduces pseudouridylation of mitochondrial 26S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) at the U1692 site, which sits in the peptidyl transferase center. This affection of mitochondrial 26S rRNA may lead to the disruption of mitochondrial translation in the fcs1-1 mutant, causing high accumulation of transcripts but low production of proteins. Dysfunctional mitochondria with abnormal structures were also observed in the fcs1-1 mutant. Overall, our results suggest that FCS1-mediated pseudouridylation of mitochondrial 26S rRNA is required for mitochondrial translation, which is critical for maintaining mitochondrial function and plant development.

TI Identification of Plasmodium falciparum Translation Initiation eIF2 beta
   Subunit: Direct Interaction with Protein Phosphatase Type 1
SO FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1c) is one of the main phosphatases whose function is shaped by many regulators to confer a specific location and a selective function for this enzyme. Here, we report that eukaryotic initiation factor 2 beta of Plasmodium falciparum (PfelF2 beta) is an interactor of PfPP1c. Sequence analysis of PfelF2 beta revealed a deletion of 111 amino acids when compared to its human counterpart and the presence of two potential binding motifs to PfPP1 ((29)FGEKKK(34), (103)KVAW(106)). As expected, we showed that PfelF2 beta binds PfelF2 gamma and PfelF5, confirming its canonical interaction with partners of the translation complex. Studies of the PfelF2 beta-PfPP1 interaction using wild-type, single and double mutated versions of PfelF2 beta revealed that both binding motifs are critical. We next showed that PfelF2 beta is able to induce Germinal Vesicle Break Down (GVBD) when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, an indicator of its capacity to regulate PP1. Only combined mutations of both binding motifs abolished the interaction with PP1 and the induction of GVBD. In P falciparum, although the locus is accessible for genetic manipulation, PfelF2 beta seems to play an essential role in intraerythrocytic cycle as no viable knockout parasites were detectable. Interestingly, as for PfPP1, the subcellular fractionation of P falciparum localized PfelF2 beta in cytoplasm and nuclear extracts, suggesting a potential effect on PfPP1 in both compartments and raising the question of a non-canonical function of Pfelf2 beta in the nucleus. Hence, the role played by PfelF2 beta in blood stage parasites could occur at multiple levels involving the binding to proteins of the translational complex and to PfPP1.

TI "Far more fair than black": Othellos on the Chilean Stage
SO MULTICULTURAL SHAKESPEARE-TRANSLATION APPROPRIATION AND PERFORMANCE
AB This article reviews part of the stage history of Shakespeare's Othello in Chile and, in particular, it focuses on two performances of the play: the first, in 1818, and the last one in 2012-2020. By comparing both productions, I aim to establish the exact date and theatrical context of the first Chilean staging of the Shakespearean tragedy using historical sources and English travellers' records, as well as to explore how the representation of a Moor and of blackness onstage evolved both in its visual dimension - the choice of costumes and the use of blackface-, and in its racial connotations alongside deep social changes. During the nineteenth century Othello became one of the most popular plays in Chile, being performed eleven times in the period of 31 years, a success that also occurred in Spain between 1802 and 1833. The early development of Chilean theatre was very much influenced not only by the ideas of the Spaniards who arrived in the country, but also by the available Spanish translations of Shakespeare; therefore, I argue that the first performances of Othello as Other - different in origin and in skin colour - were characterised by an imitative style, since actors repeated onstage the biased image of Moors that Spaniards had brought to Chile. While the assessment of Othello and race is not new, this article contrasts in its scope, as I do not discuss the protagonist's actual origin, but how the changes in Chilean social and cultural contexts can reshape and reconfigure the performance of blackness and turn it into a meaningful translation of the Shakespearean Moor that activates audiences' awareness of racism and fears of miscegenation.

TI Upstream Open Reading Frames Located in the Leader of Protein Kinase M
   zeta mRNA Regulate Its Translation
SO FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR NEUROSCIENCE
AB For protein synthesis that occurs locally in dendrites, the translational control mechanisms are much more important for neuronal functioning than the transcription levels. Here, we show that uORFs (upstream open reading frames) in the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) play a critical role in regulation of the translation of protein kinase (PKM zeta). Elimination of these uORFs activates translation of the reporter protein in vitro and in primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons. Using cell-free translation systems, we demonstrate that translational initiation complexes are formed only on uORFs. Further, we address the mechanism of translational repression of PKM zeta translation, by uORFs. We observed an increase in translation of the reporter protein under the control of PKM zeta leader in neuronal culture during non-specific activation by picrotoxin. We also show that such a mechanism is similar to the mechanism seen in cell stress, as application of sodium arsenite to neuron cultures induced translation of mRNA carrying PKM zeta 5'UTR similarly to picrotoxin activation. Therefore, we suppose that phosphorylation of elF2a, like in cell stress, is a main regulator of PKM zeta translation. Altogether, our findings considerably extend our understanding of the role of uORF in regulation of PKM zeta translation in activated neurons, important at early stages of LIP.

TI Generification by Translation: Designing Generic Systems in Context of
   the Local
SO JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB While the mechanisms of generification during implementation and use of large-scale systems are well known, this paper extends and analyzes the notion into the design phase of generic systems and provides insight into the associated socio-technical key mechanisms at play. The paper draws on the information infrastructure literature, and emphasizes how generic systems' designs always face infrastructural challenges and opportunities in the development process. The paper illustrates how a vendor solved the infrastructural challenges by (to a large degree) lending on local practice, translating perspectives, and carefully adjusting their design strategy over time. We argue that our findings have implications for practice because they underscore the malleability of the collaboration process between vendor and users. First, we suggest that designing a generic system calls for a flexible vendor willing to change and adjust the development strategy along with the evolving project. Second, to strengthen the user-developer collaboration, we highly recommend giving the user-participants, at the very early stage of a development project, a basic understanding of software design, and raising their skills in making precise contextual narratives. Third, we emphasize the importance of the project management's engagement in recruiting clinical personnel and in making it possible for the clinicians to participate in the project. Empirically, the paper presents the initial stages of a large electronic patient record (EPR) development project that has been running from 2012 in the North Norwegian health region and is due to finish in 2016.

TI THE FIRST ITALIAN TRANSLATION OF MARIN DRZIC'S THE MISER
SO KNJIZEVNA SMOTRA
AB The article analyzes the first Italian translation of Mann Drzic's comedy Skup (The Miser) in the context of a new approach to his works in Italy, where in the 1950s and 1960s respectable Slavists denied Drzic's originality and, consequently, the artistic value of his literary heritage. The approach emphasizes the problems of translating the Rennaisance text and its contextualization, regarding the historical distance and the comedy lexicon. Starting with the fact that Drzic's dramas are a serious challenge for contemporary translators because of the heavy and tedious task of transforming the archaic Ragusan language of the 16(th) century into another (in this case contemporary) linguistic system, we can conclude that the translation of the Rennaisance comedy cannot neglect the time distance and the specific features of the characters and their dramatic language. In addition, The Miser in Italian would be more "in the spirit of Drzic" if, instead of the criterion of fidelity, the criterion of commensurability was chosen, i.e., if the translator decided to create a new dramatic microcosmos based in the Italian cultural context.

TI Brecht by Formosa. Between effective staging and poetic conciseness
SO QUADERNS-REVISTA DE TRADUCCIO
AB This article deals with the dramatic theory of Bertolt Brecht and his reception by Feliu Formosa, who is the main Catalan translator of Brecht, and staged the first performance of a work by Brecht in Catalonia. The paper also analyses the influence of Brecht's theories on the so-called "independent theatre", and reviews Brecht's plays as well as his poetry, both translated by Formosa. The analysis shows that the Brecht brought in the Catalan culture by Formosa is a multifaceted author who perfectly combines scenic efficacy and poetic conciseness to turn them into a weapon at the service of social and political objectives.

TI Translational regulation during stage transitions in malaria parasites
SO MALARIA: ADVANCES IN PATHOPHYSIOLOGY, BIOLOGY, AND DRUG DEVELOPMENT
SE Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences-Series
AB The complicated life cycle of the malaria parasite involves a vertebrate host and a mosquito vector, and translational regulation plays a prominent role in orchestrating the developmental events in the two transition stages: gametocytes and sporozoites. Translational regulation is executed in both global and transcript-specific manners. Plasmodium uses a conserved mechanism involving phosphorylation of eIF2 alpha to repress global protein synthesis during the latent period of sporozoite development in the mosquito salivary glands. Transcript-specific translational regulation is achieved by a network of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), among which the Dhh1 RNA helicase DOZI and Puf family RBPs are by far the best studied in Plasmodium. While the DOZI complex defines a new P granule with a role in protecting certain gametocyte mRNAs from degradation, the Puf proteins appear to repress expression of mRNAs in both gametocytes and sporozoites. These examples underscore the significance of translational regulation in Plasmodium development.

   Approach
SO FILOLOGICHESKIE NAUKI-NAUCHNYE DOKLADY VYSSHEI SHKOLY-PHILOLOGICAL
   SCIENCES-SCIENTIFIC ESSAYS OF HIGHER EDUCATION
AB The current stage in the development of translation studies is characterized by the refusal to describe the translation process only as a method of interlingual transformation. More and more researchers consider it within the framework of interlingual and intercultural communication, where the purpose of the translated text and its communicative function are of decisive importance. Translation began to be perceived not only as a clash of languages, but also as a clash of cultures, in which ideology plays a significant role. The authors of the article propose their own working definition. By considering situations in which the ideological aspect affects the translator's work, the authors aim at helping translators evaluate whether ideological recontextualization may be desirable while dealing with discrepancies in ideological contexts between the author, readers of the source text,and the target audience of the transmitted content. The article includes instructions on how to identify problematic ideological elements, what parameters to take into account in order to see properly the differences between just culture and cultural elements with ideological overtones.

TI Decentering the Bard: The Localization of King Lear in Egyptian TV Drama
   Dahsha
SO MULTICULTURAL SHAKESPEARE-TRANSLATION APPROPRIATION AND PERFORMANCE
AB Dahsha [Bewilderment] is an Egyptian TV series written by scriptwriter Abdelrahim Kamal and adapted from Shakespeare's King Lear. The TV drama locates Al Basel Hamad Al Basha, Lear's counterpart, in Upper Egypt and follows a localized version of the king's tragedy starting from the division of his lands between his two wicked daughters and the disinheritance of his sincere daughter till his downfall. This study examines the relationship between Dahsha and King Lear and investigates the position of the Bard when contextualized in other cultures, revisited in other locales, and retold in other languages. It raises many questions about Shakespeare's proximity to the transcultural/transnational adaptations of his plays. Does Shakespeare's discourse limit the interpretation of the adapted works or does it promote intercultural conversations between the varying worldviews? Where is the Bard positioned when contextualized in other cultures, revisited in other locales, and retold in other languages? Does he stand in the center or at the margin? The study attempts to answer these questions and to read the Egyptian localization of King Lear as an independent work that transposes Shakespeare from a central dominant element into a periphery that remains visible in the background of the Upper Egyptian drama.

TI Representing Orestes' Revenge
SO CLASSICAL RECEPTIONS JOURNAL
AB This essay considers Orestes' revenge in early modern literature, especially English drama. In their surviving plays, Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides furnished varying representations of Orestes' revenge, and these representations proliferated and changed in subsequent mediations in many languages. The traditions bore strange fruits in John Pickering's Horestes (1567), the first revenge play in English; Thomas Heywood's The Second Part of the Iron Age (wr. 1612-15, pub. 1632); Thomas Goffe's The Tragedy of Orestes (wr., 1613-18, pub. 1633); and Christopher Wase's translation of Sophocles' Electra (1649), a direct return to a Greek source. Drawing upon traditions that portray a culpable Orestes furens, Heywood and Goffe feature a mad avenger in a gory stage action. Drawing upon other traditions and framing the moral imperatives differently, Pickering and Wase write political plays specifically attuned to their historical moments to depict a heroic Orestes immediately or ultimately justified, Orestes vindicatus.

TI "... This plan was conceived by me ...": On the background of D.
   Merezhkovskiy's forgotten letter to the editors of the "Mir Iskusstva"
SO SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
AB The paper clarifies the circumstances of the publication of a little-known letter by D. Merezhkovskiy in the "Mir Iskusstva" ("World of Art") journal. The letter was published under the same rubric as a letter by Yu. Ozarovskiy, director of the Alexandrinsky Theatre, a person far from the journal's editorial board, giving the impression of a public debate between like-minded people. Recreating the details of the struggle for setting ancient Greek tragedies in D. Merezhkovskiy's translations on the stages of Russian theatres, based on forgotten publications of those years, indicates that the staging of "Hippolytus", a tragedy by Euripides, was regarded by the "Mir Iskusstva" association as evidence of the effectiveness of their program in the struggle for new theatrical art. It was not D. Merezhkovskiy who played the leading role in this process, as he wrote in his letter, but D. Filosofov, who sought to stage the tragedy as a mystery play. Disagreements between D. Merezhkovskiy and the creative association of the "Mir Iskusstva" appeared later, when their aesthetic, religious, and philosophical views began to differ. However, during the production of "Hippolytus", these differences did not prevent them from participating in joint projects as a new artistic force. It should be recognized that ancient Greek tragedies in D. Merezhkovskiy's translations played a part in the history of the Russian theatre: the debate about the concept of performances, the specifics of L. Bakst's sets, and musical accompaniments was an important step in the development of the theatre in expanding its expressive capabilities.

AB This study employs in-depth qualitative interviews with Arab fans of Korean popular culture who live in Qatar to examine their cultural translation of Korean TV drama and K-pop music. It uses a transcultural approach to fandom studies, rather than foregrounding nationality as an analytic category. It focuses on fans' appropriations of these cultural texts in relation to their affinities, feelings, emotions, and accumulations of cultural capital used to negotiate their consumption of Korean popular culture. This article identifies emotions of frustration and fascination as central to these fans' transnational media engagement. It thereby shows that affinity is a central concern for research on transcultural receptions of non-Western cultures by non-Western audiences.

TI Using Forum Theatre to mobilise knowledge and improve NHS care: the
   Enhancing Post-injury Psychological Intervention and Care (EPPIC) study
SO EVIDENCE & POLICY
AB Background: Evidence regarding the impact of psychological problems on recovery from injury has limited influence on practice. Mindlines show effective practice requires diverse knowledge which is generally socially transmitted.
   Aims and objectives: Develop and test a method blending patient, practitioner, and research evidence and using Forum Theatre to enable key stakeholders to interact with it.
   Assess this methods; impact on contributing individuals/groups; on behaviour, practice, and research; mechanisms enabling these changes to occur.
   Methods: Stage-1: captured patient (n=53), practitioner (n=62), and research/expert (n=3) evidence using interviews, focus groups, literature review; combined these strands using framework analysis and conveyed them in a play. Stage-2: patients (n=32), carers (n=3), practitioners (n=31), and researchers (n=16) attended Forum Theatre workshops where they shared experiences, watched the play, re-enacted elements, and co-produced service improvements. Stage-3: used the Social Impact Framework to analyse study outcome data and establish what changed, how and why.
   Findings: This approach enhanced individuals'/group knowledge of post-injury psychopathology, confidence in their knowledge, mutual understanding, creativity, attitudes towards knowledge mobilisation, and research. These cognitive, attitudinal, and relational impacts led to multilevel changes in behaviour, practice, and research. Four key mechanisms enabled this research to occur and create impact: diverse knowledge, drama/storytelling, social interaction, actively altering outcomes.
   Discussion and conclusions: Discourse about poor uptake of scientific evidence focuses on methods to aid translation and implementation; this study shows how mindlines can reframe this 'problem' and inform impactful research.
   EPPIC demonstrated how productive interaction between diverse stakeholders using creative means bridges gaps between evidence, knowledge, and action.

TI Parody as Translation: Ibsen's new woman in the pages of Punch
SO NORDIC THEATRE STUDIES
AB "Parody as Translation: Ibsen's new woman in the pages of Punch" examines four comic parodies of Ibsen written by Thomas Antsey Guthrie, a British journalist and humourist also known as F. Antsey. The plays examined include parodies of Rosmersholm, A Doll's House, Hedda Gabler, and The Master Builder - comically abbreviated renditions of Ibsen originals that featured striking new women characters. Reading these parodies as responses to their originals, I examine what happens to the new woman character when she is subjected to comic parodic treatment. Although the parodies do not directly focus on the alteration of these key female characters, I argue that Antsey's parodic critique of Ibsenian dramaturgical mechanics, conventions, and tropes indirectly impacted their representation, transforming them from tragic heroines to comic figures and raising further questions about the relationship between gender and comedy. In each parody, the psychological complexity of the new woman character is compromised through Antsey's alteration of one or more of her key purposes within Ibsen's text. Overall, I argue that the reassessment and reinterpretation of these key Norwegian texts can be viewed as a mode of transition between Ibsen and those impacted and influenced by him, providing a cultural medium or "buffer" that helped connect the notably "serious" Scandinavian playwright with British audiences.

TI Relevance of Modality Markers in Translating from Spanish into English:
   A Case Study of Los Intereses Creados
SO PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SCIENCE AND HUMANITIES
AB The function of modality is to express the degree of the intrinsic and extrinsic assessment and judgement of a speaker or writer in terms of truth-value in propositions. One of the branches of translation studies is pure descriptive translation studies, which can be a product-oriented, function-oriented, or process-oriented. This study is product-oriented in that it examines descriptively an existing translation. This paper is a case study of Jacinto Benavente's drama, entitled "Los Intereses Creados". The study was done qualitatively and quantitatively to describe the relevance and translatability of modality markers from Spanish into English. The investigation was done in a hyponym of literary translation, drama. Both source text and target text were wholly read. The data related to modality were identified, collected, and analysed. The analyses were carried out, following Toolan's theory of modality. The analyses revealed that the English target text used more modality markers than the Spanish source text. The research revealed also that the frequency and infrequency of modality were more determined by language peculiarities and norms than by the translator; it indicates that the peculiarities and norms of both Spanish and English languages are the determinants of the translation procedures of modality.

TI A High-Resolution Optical Displacement Detection Method for

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS
AB Microdisplacement detection plays a vital role in the position diagnosis and accurate calibration of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) actuators. An optical microdisplacement detector proposed in this article integrated a vertical cavity surface-emitting laser and nine photodiodes (PDs) to detect the submicrometer translation and subdegree rotation of the piezoelectric microvibratory stage under the limited space. The highly accurate detection was mainly realized by PDs design and quality improvement. Nine PDs layout with high-resolution optical sensors and corresponding calculation guaranteed the detector to precisely acquire out-of-plane displacement and two-axis rotation of the vibratory platform. And the introduction of the light-absorbing layer and the light-shielding layer further improved the sensing quality to reach a higher measurement resolution. The microstage was fabricated by MEMS technology and the experiments of measurement system indicated that the out-of-plane displacement detection accuracy was 150 nm in the range of 500 mu m and the angle detection accuracy reached 0.1 degrees in the range of 2 degrees.

TI Comparative ribosome profiling reveals extensive translational
   complexity in different Trypanosoma brucei life cycle stages
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB While gene expression is a fundamental and tightly controlled cellular process that is regulated at multiple steps, the exact contribution of each step remains unknown in any organism. The absence of transcription initiation regulation for RNA polymerase II in the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei greatly simplifies the task of elucidating the contribution of translation to global gene expression. Therefore, we have sequenced ribosome-protected mRNA fragments in T. brucei, permitting the genome-wide analysis of RNA translation and translational efficiency. We find that the latter varies greatly between life cycle stages of the parasite and similar to 100-fold between genes, thus contributing to gene expression to a similar extent as RNA stability. The ability to map ribosome positions at sub-codon resolution revealed extensive translation from upstream open reading frames located within 5' UTRs and enabled the identification of hundreds of previously un-annotated putative coding sequences (CDSs). Evaluation of existing proteomics and genome-wide RNAi data confirmed the translation of previously un-annotated CDSs and suggested an important role for > 200 of those CDSs in parasite survival, especially in the form that is infective to mammals. Overall our data show that translational control plays a prevalent and important role in different parasite life cycle stages of T. brucei.

TI The tragedies of Sophocles translated by Pedro Montengon
SO BABEL-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE LA TRADUCTION-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF
   TRANSLATION
AB A manuscript preserved in the Royal Academy of History of Madrid shows that Pedro Montengon (1745-1824) translated the Sophoclean dramas Oedipus Rex, Electra and Philoctetes. This author wrote an interesting prologue with reflections on the Greek tragedy. In this paper, we will try to situate this production in its cultural context, analyze these translations, examine his thoughts and disquisitions on Greek tragedy and search for the reasons that prompted him to make these translations, silenced until the end of the twentieth century.

TI A peace play in wartime Germany? Pacifism in Franz Werfel's The Trojan
   Women, Berlin 1916
SO CLASSICAL RECEPTIONS JOURNAL
AB Euripides' The Trojan Women, first performed in Athens in 415 BC, has been embraced by western culture as a peace play throughout the twentieth and into the twenty-first century. During the First World War, the play was performed using two different versions - in 1915, British classicist Gilbert Murray's 1905 translation from the Greek toured America and in 1916 Austrian poet Franz Werfel's 1914 adaptation was staged in Berlin. Scholars have claimed that both were anti-war productions. This article will demonstrate that in fact neither can be interpreted unambiguously as a 'peace play' and that Werfel's version in Berlin 1916 was neither presented nor understood at the time of its performance as a condemnation of the War or of Germany's role in it. As well as shedding light on what has long been an apparently intriguing but largely unexamined anomaly in cultural censorship in wartime Berlin, this case study challenges a logocentric, literary approach to the play as text and serves to illustrate the importance of the para-textual framing, as well as the context and staging of a specific performance, in determining its reception and the meanings it creates.

TI eIF1A/eIF5B interaction network and its functions in translation
   initiation complex assembly and remodeling
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Eukaryotic translation initiation is a highly regulated process involving multiple steps, from 43S pre-initiation complex (PIC) assembly, to ribosomal subunit joining. Subunit joining is controlled by the G-protein eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5B (eIF5B). Another protein, eIF1A, is involved in virtually all steps, including subunit joining. The intrinsically disordered eIF1A C-terminal tail (eIF1A-CTT) binds to eIF5B Domain-4 (eIF5B-D4). The ribosomal complex undergoes conformational rearrangements at every step of translation initiation; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we report three novel interactions involving eIF5B and eIF1A: (i) a second binding interface between eIF5B and eIF1A; (ii) a dynamic intramolecular interaction in eIF1A between the folded domain and eIF1A-CTT; and (iii) an intramolecular interaction between eIF5B-D3 and -D4. The intramolecular interactions within eIF1A and eIF5B interfere with one or both eIF5B/eIF1A contact interfaces, but are disrupted on the ribosome at different stages of translation initiation. Therefore, our results indicate that the interactions between eIF1A and eIF5B are being continuously rearranged during translation initiation. We present a model how the dynamic eIF1A/eIF5B interaction network can promote remodeling of the translation initiation complexes, and the roles in the process played by intrinsically disordered protein segments.

AB Translating Mickiewicz s Forefathers Eve into Ukrainian, Wiktor Humeniuk had to resort to other than the Polish poet versification system, since syllabic verse, of which majority of the original text is build in Ukrainian in 19(th) century was totally superceded by syllabic-accentual verse The translator utilised the form being the closest to 13 (7 + 6) feet line 1 e Ukrainian iambic 6 feet line The latter contrary to Mickiewicz s 13 feet line has no tradition in Ukrainian drama, and it came into use in lyrical and narrative pieces no sooner than in 20(th) century As a result, the line in question could be used neither to mark the stylistic differenciations nor to settle such connotations and semantic associations that are introduced into the original text by the Polish line In his rendering Humeniuk attempted to compensate this constraint with the change of rhyme types and with almost equilinear translation of the stychic 13 feet verse which provided for preserving a specyfic type of corellation between verse and syntax To continue the translator changed the irregular syllabic verse with 8 syllables in its core present in some parr of Forefathers Eve into 4 feet trochaic line and simultaneously omitted a vast number of repetitions and parallelisms which broke the connection of the original text in the whole Part II and in some fragments of Part IV with folk poetry style

TI Translation initiation factor eIF3h targets specific transcripts to
   polysomes during embryogenesis
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) plays a central role in translation initiation and consists of five core (conserved) sub-units present in both budding yeast and higher eukaryotes. Higher eukaryotic eIF3 contains additional (noncore or nonconserved) subunits of poorly defined function, including sub-unit h (eIF3h), which in zebrafish is encoded by two distinct genes (eif3ha and eif3hb). Previously we showed that eif3ha encodes the predominant isoform during zebrafish embryogenesis and that depletion of this factor causes defects in the development of the brain and eyes. To investigate the molecular mechanism governing this regulation, we developed a genome-wide polysome-profiling strategy using stage-matched WT and eif3ha morphant zebrafish embryos. This strategy identified a large set of predominantly neural-associated translationally regulated mRNAs. A striking finding was a cohort of lens-associated crystallin isoform mRNAs lost from the eif3ha morphant polysomes, revealing a mechanism by which lens development is translationally controlled. We show that both UTR sequences of a targeted crystallin transcript are necessary but not sufficient for translational regulation by eif3ha. Therefore, our study reveals the role of a noncore eIF3 subunit in modulating a specific developmental program by regulating translation of defined transcripts and highlights the potential of the zebrafish system to identify translational regulatory mechanisms controlling vertebrate development.

TI Human GTPBP5 is involved in the late stage of mitoribosome large subunit
   assembly
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Human mitoribosomes are macromolecular complexes essential for translation of 11 mitochondrial mRNAs. The large and the small mitoribosomal subunits undergo a multistep maturation process that requires the involvement of several factors. Among these factors, GTP-binding proteins (GTPBPs) play an important role as GTP hydrolysis can provide energy throughout the assembly stages. In bacteria, many GTPBPs are needed for the maturation of ribosome subunits and, of particular interest for this study, ObgE has been shown to assist in the 50S subunit assembly. Here, we characterize the role of a related human Obg-family member, GTPBP5. We show that GTPBP5 interacts specifically with the large mitoribosomal subunit (mt-LSU) proteins and several late-stage mitoribosome assembly factors, including MTERF4:NSUN4 complex, MRM2 methyltransferase, MALSU1 and MTG1. Interestingly, we find that interaction of GTPBP5 with the mt-LSU is compromised in the presence of a non-hydrolysable analogue of GTP, implying a different mechanism of action of this protein in contrast to that of other Obg-family GTPBPs. GTPBP5 ablation leads to severe impairment in the oxidative phosphorylation system, concurrent with a decrease in mitochondrial translation and reduced monosome formation. Overall, our data indicate an important role of GTPBP5 in mitochondrial function and suggest its involvement in the late-stage of mt-LSU maturation.

TI FINDING EUGENE O'NEILL IN MAXIM GORKI'S THE LOWER DEPTHS
SO EUGENE O NEILL REVIEW
AB In his early days as an author, Eugene O'Neill modeled himself on Maxim Gorki, even mimicking the Russian playwright when posing for an early portrait. Gorki's 1902 play, Na dnie, had an immediate impact on European and American writers by demonstrating radical new ways a drama could speak to the modern world. O'Neill probably first encountered the play in its 1912 translation as The Lower Depths. In its many translations and productions Gorki's play established for early twentieth-century theater artists a standard of integrity, though the play was also frequently misinterpreted. Near the end of his career, O'Neill utilized many elements of The Lower Depths in The Iceman Cometh, for reasons that have been debated. But Gorki's play informs an interpretation of many other O'Neill plays, and the example of Gorki as a figure of modern artist resonated in the way O'Neill self-consciously fashioned himself as a modern artist.

TI A Study of the Early-Stage Translations of Foxing in Chinese Buddhism:
   The Da Banniepan Jing Trans. Dharmaksema and the Da Fangdeng Rulaizang
   Jing Trans. Buddhabhadra
SO RELIGIONS
AB The Da fangdeng rulaizang jing (Skt. Tathagatagarbha-sutra), translated by Buddhabhadra) is one of the early Chinese Buddhist canon texts where the term foxing (Jp. bussho; Buddha-nature) is clearly used to express Buddha-nature. However, the term foxing cannot be confirmed in other extant translations of the Tathagatagarbha-sutra. Another early text in the Chinese Buddhist canon, the Da banniepan jing(Skt. Mahaparinirva?a-mahasutra), translated by Dharmaksema (385-433), also used the term foxing, which cannot be correspondingly confirmed in the surviving Sanskrit fragments of this scripture. Some significant differences in foxing between the Sanskrit fragments and Dharmaksema's translation of this sutra belong to the first twelve fascicles of Dharmaksema's translation completed under his collaborators' support when he had not mastered the Chinese language. It is very likely that Faxian(sic) (337-422) translated a version of the Mahaparinirva?a-mahasutra that featured buddhadhatu as foxing. Buddhabhadra, in the same period, translated a version of the Tathagatagarbha-sutra, in which he favoured the term foxing over a literal translation of the Sanskrit. As another contemporary monk with these two, Dharmaksema translated the Mahaparinirva?a-mahasutra, going further than Faxian by using the term foxing regularly. These texts influenced the Dilun monastic tradition(sic)(sic)(sic). Among these, the term foxing and its Sinicism explanations played the most significant role, influencing the whole of the Chinese and even East Asian Buddhist thought.

TI The farse of Amphitryon (Antwerp, 1504), first French translation of a

SO RENAISSANCE AND REFORMATION
AB La farse d'Amphitrion [The Farce of Amphitryon] was published in Anvers in 1504, in a collection of anonymous verse. It was the first French translation of a Plautine comedy. First, textual and paratextual analysis enables us to reconstruct an intellectual portrait of the author - a poet in the court of Burgundy - and to propose an identification. Analysis of the translation then reveals how the poet understood Plautine language, which was often difficult, and how he sought to translate his vis comica. Special attention is given to the way in which he renders Plautus' verbal agility (word play, imagery, stichomythias, etc.) and his stage games, using the resources of the theatre - and notably of contemporary theatre. The Burgundian poet offered his readers a text which was not only faithful to its original, but also readable and effective.

TI Clinical Translation of Multipotent Mesenchymal Stromal Cells in
   Transplantation
SO SEMINARS IN NEPHROLOGY
AB The prevalence of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease is increasing each year and currently the best therapeutic option for end-stage renal disease patients is kidney transplantation. However, although short-term graft outcomes after transplantation have improved substantially as a result of new and more potent immunosuppressive drugs, the long-term survival has hardly changed. This most likely is caused by a combination of nonimmunologic side effects and sustained alloreactivity to the graft resulting in fibrosis. In addition, current immunosuppressive drugs have side effects, including nephrotoxicity, infections, and malignancies that compromise long-term outcomes. Consequently, there is a strong interest in immunosuppressive therapies that maintain efficacy, while reducing side effects. Because mesenchymal stromal cells have potent anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic properties, these cells are of particular interest as new candidates in transplant recipients. Mesenchymal stromal cells might play roles in the treatment of allograft rejection and fibrosis and in calcineurin minimization and induction protocols. In the present review we discuss both preclinical as well as clinical evidence of their therapeutic potential in kidney transplantation. In addition, challenges and obstacles for clinical translation are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI The m Subunit of Murine Translation Initiation Factor elF3 Maintains the
   Integrity of the elF3 Complex and Is Required for Embryonic Development,
   Homeostasis, and Organ Size Control
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Background: eIF3m is a non-core subunit of eIF3. Results: eIF3m deficiency in mice results in animal death and instability of other eIF3 subunits; haploinsufficiency reduces organ size. Conclusion: eIF3m is critical for eIF3 structure and function. Significance: Understanding the mechanism of eIF3 complex formation and its role in embryonic development and homeostasis is crucial for determining the physiological function of this eukaryotic translation factor.
   Mammalian eIF3 is composed of 13 subunits and is the largest eukaryotic initiation factor. eIF3 plays a key role in protein biosynthesis. However, it is not fully understood how different subunits contribute to the structural integrity and function of the eIF3 complex. Whether eIF3 is essential for embryonic development and homeostasis is also not known. Here, we show that eIF3m null embryos are lethal at the peri-implantation stage. Compound heterozygotes (eIF3m(flox/-)) or FABP4-Cre-mediated conditional knock-out mice are lethal at mid-gestation stages. Although the heterozygotes are viable, they show markedly reduced organ size and diminished body weight. Acute ablation of eIF3m in adult mouse liver leads to rapidly decreased body weight and death within 2 weeks; these effects are correlated with a severe decline of protein biogenesis in the liver. Protein analyses reveal that eIF3m deficiency significantly impairs the integrity of the eIF3 complex due to down-regulation of multiple other subunits. Two of the subunits, eIF3f and eIF3h, are stabilized by eIF3m through subcomplex formation. Therefore, eIF3m is required for the structural integrity and translation initiation function of eIF3. Furthermore, not only is eIF3m an essential gene, but its expression level is also important for mouse embryonic development and the control of organ size.

TI An Analysis of the Evolving Functionalism and Social Qualities of Zu Wu
   in Translation
SO CHUNG WAI LITERARY QUARTERLY
AB In Singapore's multicultural context, the practice of translation and social factors are interrelated and interpenetrated, promoting multicultural and multilingual interactions. With the rise of Socio-translation studies, translation is able to perform specific functions in a particular social context and influences the development of the society to a substantial extent. Relatively, a society's economic, political, and cultural development can cause pressure and influence translation activities in terms of concepts, contents and styles. Therefore, the practice of translation and social factors can either complement or restrict each other during interaction.
   Zu Wu, the public housing in Singapore managed by the Housing and Development Board (HDB), is a unique representative of Chinese vocabulary within Singapore's social context. Although it has close ties with members of the society, there is limited level of sensitivity and understanding of this term. The term "Zu Wu" has played an important role in Singapore's Public Housing History. The evolving social functions of "Zu Wu" reflect specific social phenomena and values during different developmental stages of the national building and the Public Housing policy-making process in Singapore's society, and this paper argues that this term is also a form of rewriting produced by Singapore's ideological and political constraints within its social context.

TI Ibsen metamorphosed: textual re-appropriations in the Chinese context
SO NEOHELICON
AB Since Henrik Ibsen has a wide international reputation and influence and his plays are read and performed across cultures, translation has played an important role in "establishing" multiple productions of his plays. It is true that Ibsen has been translated in different languages and cultures, and there are actually metamorphosed "Ibsens", or varying (unalike) versions of his works. According to Walter Benjamin, "since the important works of world literature never find their chosen translators at the time of their origin, their translation marks their stage of continued life" or a sort of "afterlife". Inspired by Benjamin's reflections on translation and Damrosch's emphasis on the role played by translation in constructing world literature, the author lays particular emphasis on the translation of Ibsen's plays in the Chinese context and deals with different productions of Ibsen's plays in 21st-century China. The contention here is that such translations and retranslations endow Ibsen and his plays with a "continued" life or "afterlife", enabling him to remain one of the best-known Western writers, without which he might have become "marginalized" like many of his Scandinavian peers in the Chinese cultural and literary context(s). And it is through such translations and retranslations, both interlingual and intercultural-and even intersemiotic, that there have appeared a multiplicity of Ibsens and variegated productions of his plays in China.

AB In recent years, VR technology has developed rapidly, and its application range has also developed from entertainment to education. The English video teaching made by VR technology can effectively improve students' learning enthusiasm. VR technology will surely lead to the arrival of an era, and it will also be a tool that must be carried out in the future development of many industries. Since the first year of VR, subtitle translation has also tried to use VR technology, but it has not been able to give full play to the advantages of VR technology. However, the existing video subtitle translation technology is still in the exploratory stage. Due to the frequent problems in subtitle translation, the actual teaching effect is greatly reduced. And this has just become one of the prerequisites for the application of data fusion algorithms. The characteristics of video course subtitle translation are that the course video is the source text, which is restricted by the form of audio-visual text, the actual operation of subtitle translation, and the course content. in principle. Combined with the case, the first translation and the proofreading are compared and analyzed. With the use of data fusion algorithms, it can solve the problem of letter translation in English VR video teaching. In view of this situation, this article studies the characteristics and strategies of subtitle translation in English VR video course. This study is mainly divided into three parts. The first part is the research into the characteristics of existing video subtitle translation, which analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of existing video subtitle translation one by one. Through the research, this article believes that the main shortcomings of the existing technology are cultural differences and human work deficiencies, but they can be overcome and improved. In view of these problems, the second part of this article is to improve the problem of English letter translation in the actual application process through the use of data fusion algorithms. The third part of this article is the investigation and research, using the way of investigation to verify the specific effect of the improvement method in this article. Through the analysis of the survey data, we can see that the improved English VR video course has been widely praised by the students, which not only increases the learning enthusiasm, but also improves the learning effect.

TI YB-1 Structure/Function Relationship in the Packaging of mRNPs and
   Consequences for Translation Regulation and Stress Granule Assembly in
   Cells
SO BIOCHEMISTRY-MOSCOW
AB From their synthesis in the nucleus to their degradation in the cytoplasm, all mRNAs have the same objective, which is to translate the DNA-stored genetic information into functional proteins at the proper time and location. To this end, many proteins are generally associated with mRNAs as soon as transcription takes place in the nucleus to organize spatiotemporal regulation of the gene expression in cells. Here we reviewed how YB-1 (YBX1 gene), one of the major mRNA-binding proteins in the cytoplasm, packaged mRNAs into either compact or extended linear nucleoprotein mRNPs. Interestingly the structural plasticity of mRNPs coordinated by YB-1 could provide means for the contextual regulation of mRNA translation. Posttranslational modification of YB-1, notably in the long unstructured YB-1 C-terminal domain (CTD), and/or the protein partners of YB-1 may play a key role in activation/inactivation of mRNPs in the cells notably in response to cellular stress.

TI The Song Narrative as an Expression of the Verbal Culture of Siberia in
   George Grebenstchikoff's Fairy Tale "Khan Altai" and Its English
   Self-Translation
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
AB The article discusses the functioning of song passages in George Grebenstchikoff's fairytale "Khan Altai". It was first published in the Riga journal Perezvony in 1928 and belongs to the initial stage of the writer's work after his emigration to the United States. The English-language self-translation of the fairy tale was created in the 1940s and has not been published. The Archive of the Museum of Fine Arts (Barnaul) has five versions of the translation. In the fairy tale, the image of Altai plays the central role. The aim of the study is to identify ways of creating the song passages, their functioning in the text, and their influence on the tale's poetics. The material consists of 12 passages. Grebenstchikoff created them on the basis of traditional folk songs, which influenced the form, the composition, and the system of images. The song fragments are written in unrhymed blank verse, stylized as translations of Altai folklore. The author accentuates the song passages graphically and intonationally: they differ from the context by the characteristics of the verse. The literary analysis made during the study showed the following results. Grebenstchikoff's appeal to the folk tradition is manifested in the choice of the form of the song passages. He uses an amoebean design based on the parallelism of compositionally significant parts and images. The clarity of the song rhythm of the Russian unrhymed poetic text is achieved through inversion ("Were I into a bird to turn - by the entrance of her wigwam I would sit"), lexical repetitions ("Oh, come, come, come, Katun-Su!"), syntactic parallelism ("Tell, then, to my father that as a hero in battle I fell, // And to my mother that fifteen wounds I had received!"). When creating the English self-translation, Grebenstchikoff used the same strategies as in the original work. The analysis shows the high accuracy of the translation: all the passages were translated and arranged graphically in the same way, the climax aspects of the songs were also transmitted with high accuracy. The line and stanza division of the text was also preserved, and the compositional characteristics of the amoebean design were transferred to the English text. In the final part of the article, the author draws a number of conclusions. The form of the song passages in "Khan-Altai" serves as a means of constructing characterology and adds a sacred motif to the images of the fairy tale. In the tale and its translation, psychological parallelism is used, based on the animistic worldview. The preservation of the native culture in exile, thoughts about the self-determination of Russia, Siberia and Altai led Grebenstchikoff to work on translating poetic monuments in the space of another linguaculture, to appeal to traditional Altai folklore, on the one hand, and to choose a fairy tale plot, on the other.

SO RLC-REVUE DE LITTERATURE COMPAREE
AB In 1856, the oxonian philologist Max Muller launches the new discipline of comparative mythology with an essay, defending the famous theory of the "solar drama". Ernest Renan gives a first French translation of the Comparative Mythology in 1859, and adapts the original text to what he calls the "taste" of French readers. This article intends to show the extent of the suppressions and changes from the original text to its first French version, some of which are still visible in most recent editions. It also aims at interpreting these choices in the light of the scientific context of two academic worlds, from England to France during the XIXth century, from positivism to the emergence of new comparative methods.

TI "Some People Are Born Strange": A Brechtian Theater Pedagogy as
   Philosophical Ethnography
SO QUALITATIVE INQUIRY
AB The article explores the role of a Brechtian theater pedagogy as philosophical ethnography in four investigative drama-based workshops, which took international students' intercultural strangeness experiences as the starting point for aesthetic experimentation. It is argued that a Brechtian theater pedagogy allows for a productive rather than representational orientation in research, which is underpinned by a love for the aesthetic re-entanglement of (dis-embodied) language and ethical concerns about mimetic representational acts. To show how a Brechtian research pedagogy functioned as philosophical ethnography, the article maps the aesthetic transformation of participant Jamal's verbatim account in the drama workshopsfrom (a) its emergence in a post-creative-writing discussion in Workshop 2, to (b) its enactment as a body sculpture in Workshop 3, and (c) to its translation into a rehearsal piece in Workshop 4.

TI Transcriptome identification and characterization of long non-coding
   RNAs in the ovary of hens at four stages
SO ANIMAL BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. LncRNAs, which are defined as non-coding RNAs more than 200 bp in length, are involved in key biological processes, such as cell proliferation and differentiation, epigenetic regulation, and gene transcriptional translation. Recent studies have shown that lncRNAs also play major regulatory roles in the reproduction of mammals. However, knowledge of the roles of lncRNAs in the chicken ovary lacking. In this study, we performed RNA-seq analyses of ovarian tissue from Hy-Line brown laying hens at four physiological stages [15, 20, 30, and 68 weeks of age (W)]. We identified 657 lncRNA transcripts that were differentially expressed during ovarian development, the number of down-regulated lncRNAs was higher than the number of up-regulated lncRNAs during development. We predicted the cis and trans target genes of the DE lncRNAs and constructed a lncRNA-mRNA interaction network, which indicated that the DE genes (DEGs) and the target genes of the DE lncRNAs are mainly involved in signaling pathways associated with ovarian development, including oocyte meiosis, calcium signaling pathways, ECM-receptor interactions, and ribosome and focal adhesion. Overall, we found that twelve lncRNAs were strongly involved in ovarian development: LNC_013443, LNC_001029, LNC_005713, LNC_016762, ENSGALT00000101857, LNC_003913, LNC_013692, LNC_012219, LNC_004140, ENSGALT00000096941, LNC_009356, and ENSGALT00000098716. In summary, our study utilized RNA-seq analysis of hen ovaries to explore key lncRNAs involved in ovarian development and function. Furthermore, the comprehensive analysis identified the target genes of these lncRNAs providing a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying ovarian development in hens and a theoretical basis for further research.

TI A potential role for a novel ZC3H5 complex in regulating mRNA
   translation in Trypanosoma brucei
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB In Trypanosoma brucei and related kinetoplastids, gene expression regulation occurs mostly posttranscriptionally. Consequently, RNA-binding proteins play a critical role in the regulation of mRNA and protein abundance. Yet, the roles of many RNA-binding proteins are not understood. Our previous research identified the RNA-binding protein ZC3H5 as possibly involved in gene repression, but its role in controlling gene expression was unknown. We here show that ZC3H5 is an essential cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein. RNAi targeting ZC3H5 causes accumulation of precytokinetic cells followed by rapid cell death. Affinity purification and pairwise yeast two-hybrid analysis suggest that ZC3H5 forms a complex with three other proteins, encoded by genes Tb927.11.4900, Tb927.8.1500, and Tb927.7.3040. RNA immunoprecipitation revealed that ZC3H5 is preferentially associated with poorly translated, low-stability mRNAs, the 5 '-untranslated regions and coding regions of which are enriched in the motif (U/A)UAG(U/A). As previously found in high-throughput analyses, artificial tethering of ZC3H5 to a reporter mRNA or other complex components repressed reporter expression. However, depletion of ZC3H5 in vivo caused only very minor decreases in a few targets, marked increases in the abundances of very stable mRNAs, an increase in monosomes at the expense of large polysomes, and appearance of "halfmer" disomes containing two 80S subunits and one 40S subunit. We speculate that the ZC3H5 complex might be implicated in quality control during the translation of suboptimal open reading frames.

TI Narrative Persuasion and Social Norms in Entertainment-Education:
   Results from a Radio Drama in Mozambique
SO HEALTH COMMUNICATION
AB Narrative persuasion and social norms are part of the most recent theorizing behind the health communication strategy known as entertainment-education. There is little research, however, that compares these theoretical constructs from Mozambique, a setting that has not been researched to the same extent as other EE practice locations. This study uses mixed methods data from the midline evaluation of Ouro Negro (English translation: Black Gold), an EE radio program for individual health and social change in Mozambique to answer two research questions: what is the relationship between exposure to Ouro Negro and narrative persuasion?, and what is the relationship between narrative persuasion with Ouro Negro and social norms? Quantitative results related to the first question indicated that exposure significantly predicted three narrative persuasion constructs in multivariate regression models, results confirmed by a storytelling activity in focus groups. Quantitative results for the second question, which utilized propensity score matching, were not significant, and findings from a qualitative 2 x 2 table activity confirmed that behaviors were not normative in the directions promoted by the radio drama. Implications and recommendations for future entertainment-education research are discussed.

TI Online Algorithm Design of English Translation of Film and Television
   Works under the Background of Media Cultural Information
SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB As a carrier and medium of culture, film and television have richer cultural connotations and a mission of cross-cultural communication. The translation and dissemination of film and television works not only play an important role in enhancing understanding and communication between different countries, but also contribute to the social life and values of ordinary people. Influence is growing. In order to improve the media communication function of film and television works, this paper attempts to explain and discuss how subtitle translation uses these two translation strategies through the analysis of Chinese and foreign film and television dramas. Through the analysis of the specific translation process of film and television works, the author draws the conclusion that in order to achieve the specific translation purpose, the subtitle translation should be based on the author's intention, translation purpose, text type, and reader factors. This paper adopts a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods and selects suitable examples to explain or illustrate the phenomenon of film and television translation in the description and analysis process. The system designed in the paper is designed with the dissemination and evaluation of film and television works as parameters. The example in this study is that the author himself recorded it according to the Chinese and English subtitles on the screen when watching. Without personal modification, the selected films are officially official institutions, published or broadcast translations. This research focuses on the dialectical analysis and thinking of the collected corpus, so that the conclusions are more convincing than just giving some perceptual examples.

TI Children's literature and human-canine culture: Transformations of James
   M. Barrie's dog Nana in cross-cultural translation
SO VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE
   UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY
AB The representation of dogs in children's literature forms the subject of this article. It is framed within the concept of human-canine societies introduced by the French anthropologist Dominique Guillot who claimed that alongside any human society there exists a hybrid society formed by human beings and dogs in which dogs are regarded as its full members. Such societies exist in each country and they generate their own cultures that are developed gradually through ontogenetic ritualization but may change over time. The focus of the following research is the interconnection between children's literature and such human-canine cultures. I claim that children's literature is influenced by them and influences them at the same time. The key figure of the research, the Scottish writer James M. Barrie, not only gave dogs the status of full members of the society but endowed them with the status of his muses in his personal, public, and literary life. His own dog, a landseer Newfoundland called Luath, was his pet, friend, muse, and a prototype for Nana, a nanny dog from Barrie's most famous play Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up. I aim to study and analyze the transformations that occur to Nana when the play was staged, adapted, illustrated and published into a different human-canine culture. The source material of the study is a draft version of the play, the first published version of the play, illustrations for numerous British and American adaptations of the Peter Pan story, and the first Soviet edition of the play. The three parts of the article describe the history of the creation of Nana and the formation of her iconography in Great Britain; the history of the first American production and two further adaptations of the play, as well as the changes that Nana underwent in the American tradition; the history of the first translation of the play in the USSR and the work of the translator and artist in the construction of the Soviet Nana. I come to the conclusion that the image of Nana is formed in the period of time when the contemporary human-pet culture was introduced and incorporated into British mindset. I prove that Nana was Luath's copy: his character and even his black marks were recreated in Nana's costume. Moreover, Barrie's popularity and his daily walks with Luath in Kensington Gardens turned the writer and his dog a landmark in London, so the British iconography of Nana developed rapidly and practically did not change over time. In the United States and the Soviet Union, the countries with their own unique human-dog cultures, Nana was transformed into a St. Bernard and a Cocker Spaniel respectively. Such transformations may be explained by different reasons. While in the United States this is a consequence of the blend of Luath with Barrie's first dog, St. Bernard Porthos, which the writer himself confessed, in the USSR the reasons were rooted in politics and ideology which to a large extent influenced Soviet human-canine culture and hence the representation of dogs in children's books.

TI Morphological plasticity of hyperelongated cells caused by
   overexpression of translation elongation factor P inSynechococcus
   elongatusPCC7942
SO APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Translation elongation factors (EFs) are proteins that play important roles during the elongation stage of protein synthesis. In prokaryotes, at least four EFs function in repetitive reactions (EF-Tu, EF-Ts, EF-G, and EF-P). EF-P plays a vital role in the specialized translation of consecutive proline amino acid motifs. It was also recently recognized that EF-P acts throughout translation elongation. Here, we demonstrated for the first time that cell division and morphology are intimately linked to the control of EF-P in the model cyanobacteriumSynechococcus elongatusPCC7942. We constructed the overexpression of a wild-type gene product for EF-P (Synpcc7942_2565) as a tool to identify EF-P functionality. The overexpression of EF-P resulted in the morphological plasticity of hyperelongated cells. During the stationary phase, EF-P overexpressors displayed cell lengths of 150 mu m or longer, approximately 35 times longer than the control. Total cellular protein and amino acid content were also increased in overexpressors. To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying hyperelongation, gene expression analysis was performed. The results revealed that cell division genes, includingftn6,minD,mreB,mreC, andftsZ, were modulated in overexpressors. Strikingly,ftn6was severely down-regulated. Little is known regarding EF-P in prokaryotic photosynthetic organisms. Our results suggest that cyanobacterial EF-P participates in the acceleration of protein synthesis and also regulates cell division processes. These findings suggest new ways to modify translation and metabolism in cyanobacteria. Phenotypic and metabolic alterations caused by overexpressing EF-P may also be beneficial for applications such as low-cost, green molecular factories.

TI Bernard Shaw's Dionysian Trilogy Reworkings of Gilbert Murray's
   Translation of Euripides's Bacchae in Major Barbara, Misalliance, and

SO SHAW-THE JOURNAL OF BERNARD SHAW STUDIES
AB This article outlines how Bernard Shaw reworks elements from Gilbert Murray's translation of Euripides's Bacchae in Major Barbara (1905), Misalliance (1909/10), and Heartbreak House (1916/17), which taken together constitute a Dionysian trilogy. The article further proposes that the Greek example, and especially the Dionysian with its religious implications as propounded by Murray, was crucial to several aspects of Shaw's writing including his politics and economics of equality and his philosophy of a life force, while he himself represented the Dionysian zeitgeist socially, politically, and culturally for that younger generation soon to be decimated in the Great War. This Dionysian Shaw is recognized, as his contemporaries viewed him, as the leading figure in pre- World War I Britain of that first wave of literary modernism, whose impact has been obscured by the better known, perhaps more aesthetically radical, if more politically conservative postwar second wave.

SO NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
AB The article examines the evolution of the image of Artaxerxes in Russian drama of the 17th - 18th centuries. The focus is on the plays Artaxerxes Action by pastor J.G. Gregory and Artaxerxes - a translation of the eponymous "heroic play" by the classic of Danish literature, comedian, historian and moralist L. Holberg. The translation of Artaxerxes into Russian was made from German, belongs to A. Nartov and published in 1764. It is noted that the Danish Artaxerxes is a processing of the libretto by P. Metastasio, and its appearance is associated with Holberg's search for the new forms of expression common to his plays ideas of victory of virtue over vice. Among the numerous works of Metastasio, translated in Russia in the 18th century, the opera Artaxerxes is absent, the Russian translation of Holberg's play has lost the relations with the libretto, is called tragedy and is on a par with the original Russian tragedies of the 50-60s. 18th century on the Persian theme - "Artistona" by A.P. Sumarokov, "The Fake Smerdy" by A.A. Rzhevsky and "Panthea" by F.Ya. Kozelsky. Moreover, the Russian Artaxerxes is in the context of Holberg's dramatic works, translated and published in Russia in the 18th - the first third of the 19th centuries, and published together with the comedy "Henry and Pernilla". The article provides a comparative analysis of the Russian text with the original Danish version and with Russian translations of other works of Holberg, identifies and explains the differences in the image of ideal monarchs - the heroes of the plays by Gregory and by Metastasio-Holberg: merciless or merciful, but always fair.

AB Cell-free gene expression has applications in synthetic biology, biotechnology and biomedicine. In this technique gene expression regulation plays an important role. Transcription factors do not completely suppress expression while other methods for expression control, for example CRISPR/Cas, often require important biochemical modifications. Here we use an all Escherichia coli-based cell-free expression system and present a bead-based method to instantly start and, at a later stage, completely stop gene expression. Magnetic beads coated with DNA of the gene of interest trigger gene expression. The expression stops if we remove the bead-bound DNA as well as transcribed mRNA by hybridization to bead-bound ssDNA. Our method is a simple way to control expression duration very accurately in time and space.

   on scaling-up childhood obesity interventions
SO PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES
AB Background Pilot/feasibility studies play an important role in the development and refinement of behavioral interventions by providing information about feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy. Despite their importance and wide-spread use, the approaches taken by behavioral scientists to scale-up early-stage studies to larger-scale trials has received little attention. The aim of our study was to understand the role that pilot studies play in the development and execution of larger-scale trials. Methods We conducted interviews with childhood obesity researchers who had published pilot behavioral interventions and larger-scale trials of the same or similar interventions. Questions were asked about the role of pilot studies in developing larger-scale trials and the challenges encountered when scaling-up an intervention based upon pilot findings. Data were coded and analyzed using an inductive analytic approach to identify themes. Results Twenty-four interventionists (54% women, 37-70 years old, mean 20 years since terminal degree) completed a total of 148 pilot studies across their careers (mean 6.4, range 1-20), of which 59% were scaled-up. Scaling was described as resource intensive and pilot work was considered essential to successfully competing for funding by 63% of the sample (n = 15). When asked to define a high-quality pilot study, interventionists described studies that allowed them to evaluate two independent factors: components of their intervention (e.g., acceptability, feasibility) and study parameters (e.g., sample size, measures). Interventionists expressed that more process implementation measures, different study designs, and additional iterations could improve decisions to scale-up. Most agreed that pilot studies were likely to produce inflated estimates of potential efficacy though only nine interventionists provided potential solutions for decreasing inflated measures of efficacy. Suggested major causes of inflated effects included high levels of oversight in pilot studies (e.g., researcher support), reliance on subjective measures, and utilizing convenience or highly motivated samples. Potential solutions included designing pilots for real-world implementation, only conducting randomized controlled pilot studies, and pre-registering pilot studies. Conclusions Pilot studies purposes are multifaceted and deemed essential to obtaining funding for larger-scale trials. Clarifying the form and function of preliminary, early-stage research may enhance the productive utilization of early-stage studies and reduced drops in efficacy when transitioning to larger scale studies.

TI Pasolini Translator of Aeschylus. Notes on the 1960 Orestiade
SO STUDI PASOLINIANI-RIVISTA INTERNAZIONALE
AB The essay analyzes Pier Paolo Pasolini's translation commissioned by Vittorio Gassman in 1959 for the XVI representation of 1960 at the Greek Theater of Syracuse by the National Institute of Ancient Drama. Pasolini is not a philologist, is a poet and as a poet he translates the events of the Atridi. The text proposes an analysis of the Pasolinian translation on the prologues of the three tragedies (Agamemnon, Libation Bearers, Eumenides) and it reveals a relationship with the sources used by the author (the translations of Mason, Thomson and Untersteiner). Pasolini, with an apparently simple vocabulary and a not excessively articulated syntax, tries to bring the Italian public of 1960, its culture and its ideology, closer to the eskylist text. Pasolini's translation is a real one poetic reworking that recalls his antecedent work Le ceneri di Gramsci: first lexical laboratory and workshop for its translation of the Orestea.

TI Othello in the Balkans: Performing Race Rhetoric on the Albanian Stage
SO MULTICULTURAL SHAKESPEARE-TRANSLATION APPROPRIATION AND PERFORMANCE
AB This essay examines the racialized rhetoric in Fan Noli's 1916 Othello translation and the racialized performance techniques employed in A. J. Ricko's 1953 National Theatre of Albania production. Hoping to combat racial discrimination in Albania, Noli's translation of Othello renders the Moor an exceptional Turk whose alienation in Venice was designed to mirror the Albanophobic experiences of Albanian immigrants. Moreover, the Albanian Othello can serve as a platform for addressing ethno-racial tensions between Albanians and Turks, northern and southern Albanians, and Albanians of color and white Albanians. Both Noli and Ricko believed there was an anti-racist power inherent within Shakespeare's play. In the end, however, the race-based rhetoric in the Albanian language, the use of blackface make-up in performance, and the logic and rhetoric of Shakespeare's play itself challenged these lofty goals for race-healing.

TI One-stage debridement and bone transport versus first-stage debridement
   and second-stage bone transport for the management of lower limb
   post-traumatic osteomyelitis
SO JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC TRANSLATION
AB Background: Treatment of lower limb post-traumatic osteomyelitis used to be a staged process, with radical debridement of bone and soft tissues at first stage, followed by a second-stage limb reconstruction operation to restore the limb integrity. Some studies recently reported that achieving infection eradication and limb reconstruction at single-stage seems to be an effective method for lower limb infection, but a comparative study remains lacking. This study aims to compare the results of radical debridement combined with a first/second-staged osteotomy and bone transport, for the management of lower limb post-traumatic osteomyelitis.
   Methods: From January 2013 to June 2018, a total of 102 patients with lower limb post-traumatic osteomyelitis met the criteria were included for analysis, in which 70 patients received one-stage debridement, antibioticloaded implantation, metaphysis osteotomy and bone transport were named as one-stage group, while 32 patients with first-stage debridement and antibiotic-loaded calcium sulfate implantation, second-stage osteotomy and bone transport were devised as two-stage group. The outcomes of hospitalization (hospital stay, costs of treatment, surgical time, antibiotic usage) and follow-up (infection-free, treatment failure, infection recurrence, external fixation index (EFI) and docking site union) between the two groups were retrospectively compared.
   Results: For outcomes of hospitalization, patients in the one-stage group had batter results on hospital stay (18.2 days versus 28.9 days, P < 0.05), surgical time (164.8 min versus 257.4 min, P < 0.05), cost of treatment (<yen>101726.1 versus <yen>126718.8, P < 0.05) and the course of antibiotic usage (10.3 days versus 12.0 days, P < 0.05). During the follow-up, 87.1% (61/70) patients in the one-stage group compared to 93.8% (30/32) patients in the two-stage group achieved infection-free (P > 0.05) without any additional debridement operation. 94.3% (66/70) patients in the one-stage group earned wound healing after the operation, comparing to 96.9% (31/32) patients healed in the two-stage group (P > 0.05). Uncontrolled infection was observed on 4 (5.7%) patients in the onestage group and 1 (3.1%) patients in the two-stage group (P > 0.05), with a result of three achieved infection free in the one-stage group and one patient suffered from amputation in each group respectively. 5 (7.2%) patients in the one-stage group and 1 (3.2%) patient in the two-stage group encountered with infection recurrence (P > 0.05) and were well-managed with re-debridement and antibiotics usage. Significance was not found between two groups on EFI (74.8 days/cm versus 69.0 days/cm, P > 0.05) and docking site nonunion rate (14.5% versus 18.9%, P > 0.05), indicating that bone transport in different stages played a less essential role on bone generation process. The other complications, such as prolonged aseptic drainage [24.3% (17/70) versus 21.9% (7/32)], refracture [5.8% (4/69) versus 3.2% (1/31)], pin-tract infection [23.2% (16/69) versus 19.4% (6/31)], joint stiffness and deformity [26.1% (18/69) versus 32.3% (10/31)], also showed less significance when comparing between two groups (P > 0.05), suggesting that different transport stages play little role on complications formation.
   Conclusions: One-stage radical debridement and bone transport was proven to be a safe and effective method for treating static (or near static) lower limb osteomyelitis. Translational potential statement:
   Translational potential statement One-stage debridement and bone transport is sample, effective and time-saving, with similar complications compared to conventional two-stage protocol. This treatment protocol might provide an alternative for the treatment of static (or near static) lower limb osteomyelitis.

TI Specialized eRpL22 paralogue-specific ribosomes regulate specific mRNA
   translation in spermatogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster
SO MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF THE CELL
AB The functional significance of ribosome heterogeneity in development and differentiation is relatively unexplored. We present the first in vivo evidence of ribosome heterogeneity playing a role in specific mRNA translation in a multicellular eukaryote. Eukaryotic-specific ribosomal protein paralogues eRpL22 and eRpL22-like are essential in development and required for sperm maturation and fertility in Drosophila. eRpL22 and eRpL22-like roles in spermatogenesis are not completely interchangeable. Flies depleted of eRpL22 and rescued by eRpL22-like overexpression have reduced fertility, confirming that eRpL22-like cannot substitute fully for eRpL22 function, and that paralogues have functionally distinct roles, not yet defined. We investigated the hypothesis that specific RNAs differentially associate with eRpL22 or eRpL22-like ribosomes, thereby establishing distinct ribosomal roles. RNA-seq identified 12,051 transcripts (mRNAs/noncoding RNAs) with 50% being enriched on specific polysome types. Analysis of similar to 10% of the most abundant mRNAs suggests ribosome specialization for translating groups of mRNAs expressed at specific stages of spermatogenesis. Further, we show enrichment of "model" eRpL22-like polysome-associated testis mRNAs can occur outside the germline within S2 cells transfected with eRpL22-like, indicating that germline-specific factors are not required for selective translation. This study reveals specialized roles in translation for eRpL22 and eRpL22-like ribosomes in germline differentiation.

TI By means of etudes: Boris Kulnev in an advanced actor training class in
   Beijing, 1955-1956
SO STANISLAVSKI STUDIES
AB From January 1955 to April 1956, the Soviet acting teacher Boris Grigorievich Kulnev (1904-1990) conducted an Advanced Actor Training Class at the Central Academy of Drama in Beijing. This programme was caught up in a larger agenda, which aimed at diffusing the Stanislavsky System of acting throughout the newly established theatres and dramatic schools in the People's Republic of China. The participants were carefully chosen from all regions of the country and had to take entrance exams for admission. The year-and-half training programme encompassed all classical Stanislavskian exercises from concentration of attention to the method of etude. All in all, the students rehearsed four plays, including an adaptation of the Chinese novel Baofeng zhouyu (The Hurricane). Once the head of the Boris Shchukin Higher Drama School at the Vakhtangov Theatre, Kulnev was steeped in the Vakhtangov school of stage art, a prestigious lineage traceable to Evgeny Vakhtangov, a protege of Stanislavsky and Leopold Sulerzhitsky who had adopted the etude technique as one of his staple training practices. By analysing the transcripts of the Advanced Class, this article zooms in on the exercises coached by Kulnev at the stage of basic actor-training and the thematic etudes he used in devising The Hurricane. I argue that by introducing etudes, Kulnev enabled the actors to adapt to changing conditions onstage, with improvisation erupting into their performance time and again. Unless otherwise noted, all translations in this paper are the author's own.

TI Blended Teaching Strategies of College English Translation under the
   Background of Internet
SO MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB Blended learning has taken center stage in higher education because it involves overseeing of "Online learning" and the ongoing growth of teaching reform in colleges and universities. Internet promotes the reconfiguration and integration of educational resources. The Internet has greatly magnified the role and value of high-quality educational resources. Blended teaching combines the advantages of traditional teaching and network teaching to complement each other; it not only gives full play to the flexibility and autonomy of network teaching, but also retains the connection of teacher-student emotional communication in traditional teaching. Translation teaching is an important part of college English teaching. This article mainly introduces the research of college English translation (CET) blended teaching strategies under the Internet background. This paper proposes a research plan for CET blended teaching strategies under the Internet background, including literature research method, questionnaire survey method, analytic hierarchy process, expert interview method, teaching evaluation sentiment classification algorithm based on feature-weighted Stacking algorithm, and analytic hierarchy process of the teaching effect evaluation algorithm. The experimental results of this article show that the average value of the questionnaire Cronbach's alpha coefficient is 0.915, demonstrating that the study's information is both extremely plausible and reasonably real.

TI Travelling intimacies, translation and betrayal in a creative geography
SO CULTURAL GEOGRAPHIES
AB In 2019, we collaborated with German theatre artists to co-create Between Worlds: Outsourcing Dementia Care, an immersive, multi-media piece performed in Newcastle and Berlin. This performance work animated and staged our interviews conducted with the owners of and caregivers working in private care facilities recently built in northern Thailand to provide dementia care for overseas guests from across the Global North. This creation process also drew from interviews we conducted with the family members who had chosen this option for their loved ones with dementia. Incorporating elements of documentary theatre, movement and cinematic projection, Between Worlds was designed to bring audiences into an intimate space, drawing them close to the complexities of the outsourcing of dementia care in order to prompt public conversation and reflection on dementia care in both Thailand and the Global North. Here, we consider the performance of the play and the method that our theatre collaborators used to render transparent the process of translation within performance. We critically assess the outcome to question the possible betrayals implicit in creative and social science work and in the doing of cultural geography.

TI Seneca as tragedian and moralist in the Spanish Renaissance: the
   translations of Fray Luis, Mal Lara and Herrera
SO REVISTA DE ESTUDIOS LATINOS
AB Seneca's Tragedies were crucial for the development of modern European drama, but contrary to what happened in other European countries, they were not translated into Spanish during the Renaissance. Nevertheless, in the course of the sixteenth century, and prior to the composition of the first Senecan plays in Spanish, a few fragments of his Tragedies were translated by several writers, who inserted these texts mostly as citations into longer works. This paper focuses on fifteen passages of Seneca's Tragedies that were translated by Fray Luis de Leon, Juan de Mal Lara, and Fernando de Herrera, and it shows how the main concern of these translators' approach to Seneca was that of illustrating various views on moral teaching.

TI Downregulation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3b inhibited
   proliferation and metastasis of gastric cancer
SO CELL DEATH & DISEASE
AB Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) plays an important role in the regulation of mRNA translation, cell growth and cancer development. eIF3b is the main scaffolding subunit in the eIF3 complex and has been demonstrated to contribute to the development of several cancers. First, our study found that the downregulation of eIF3b could inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of gastric cancer cells by regulating the expression of cancer-related genes. In addition, the expression of eIF3b correlated with the stage and progression of gastric cancer and was shown to be upregulated in human chronic gastritis and in gastric cancer tissues compared with the expression of eIF3b in normal gastric tissues. Moreover, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection could upregulate the expression of eIF3b in gastric cancer cells, suggesting that eIF3b might be involved in the carcinogenic process of H. pylori. The above findings identified the oncogenic role of eIF3b in gastric cancer development, and this may contribute to the exploration and discovery of novel therapeutic targets for gastric cancer treatment.

TI Characterisation of Translation Elongation Factor eEF1B Subunit
   Expression in Mammalian Cells and Tissues and Co-Localisation with
   eEF1A2
SO PLOS ONE
AB Translation elongation is the stage of protein synthesis in which the translation factor eEF1A plays a pivotal role that is dependent on GTP exchange. In vertebrates, eEF1A can exist as two separately encoded tissue-specific isoforms, eEF1A1, which is almost ubiquitously expressed, and eEF1A2, which is confined to neurons and muscle. The GTP exchange factor for eEF1A1 is a complex called eEF1B made up of subunits eEF1Ba, eEF1Bd and eEF1Bc. Previous studies have cast doubt on the ability of eEF1B to interact with eEF1A2, suggesting that this isoform might use a different GTP exchange factor. We show that eEF1B subunits are all widely expressed to varying degrees in different cell lines and tissues, and at different stages of development. We show that ablation of any of the subunits in human cell lines has a small but significant impact on cell viability and cycling. Finally, we show that both eEF1A1 and eEF1A2 colocalise with all eEF1B subunits, in such close proximity that they are highly likely to be in a complex.

AB Rare cells play essential roles in the initiation and progression of diseases and therefore their analysis is of great interest. The micro-magnetofluidic system is one of the emerging platforms that have been proposed for the rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective analysis of rare cells. Given its unprecedented throughput, micro-magnetofluidic systems have attracted substantial research interest in the last decade-multiple designs have been proposed, validated, and even advanced to the stage of clinical trials. This mini review aims to provide a timely summary of the relevant progress in the field thus far. We reviewed the concepts and realizations of micro-magnetofluidic devices based on the interaction between nanoparticles and on-chip micro-magnets. Their real-world applications in rare cell analysis were also highlighted and explained. In addition, we discussed the major challenges in the development and translation of micro-magnetofluidic into the clinic, including multi-marker capability and large-scale manufacturability.

TI Dramatic texts in the Tudor curriculum: John Palsgrave and the Henrician
   educational reforms
SO RENAISSANCE STUDIES
AB In 1540, the English humanist scholar, schoolmaster, and royal chaplain John Palsgrave (d. 1554) published a bilingual Latin-English annotated edition of the Dutch humanist and reformer Wilhelm Gnapheus' (1493-1568) widely popular play Acolastus (1529). Palsgrave's Acolastus reflects a growing trend in England and on the continent to Christianize Terence for classroom use, to expurgate or simply move away from the morally ambiguous classical playwrights. More importantly, the English edition of Acolastus was meant to form part, as a proposed standardized text, of the educational reforms of the late 1530s initiated by the government in accordance with the Protestant policy to reorganize grammar schools and unify their curriculum. As part of these reforms, Palsgrave elevated the educational function of dramatic texts by selecting a contemporary neo-Latin play as a model for textual exegesis in class and by making it the main source of Latin language practice. Palsgrave's extensive annotations reveal how dramatic texts were taught, analysed, and applied not only to practical rhetorical training performed on stage, but also to the grammatical and ethical reading of literary texts in the lower forms of English grammar schools. Furthermore, Palsgrave's annotations attest to a much broader pedagogical application of English translations, highlighting a conscious vernacularization within the humanist curriculum that took place considerably earlier in the sixteenth century than has been hitherto assumed.

TI Identification of Microproteins in Hep3B Cells at Different Cell Cycle
   Stages
SO JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH
AB Microproteins are generated from small open reading frames andturn out to play various vital biological functions. As an essential biological event ofeukaryotic cells, the cell cycle is involved in cell replication and division. For such ahighly regulated event, microproteins associated with cell cycle regulation remainedunclarified. Utilizing a combination of bottom-up and top-down proteomics, weanalyzed microproteins at specific cell cycle stages of Hep3B cells. A total of 657microproteins were identified under three cell cycle stages, including 151 in the G0/G1 stage, 163 in the S stage, and 132 in the G2/M stage. The annotation of these microproteins showed their cell cycle-specific functions, such as translation, nuclear assembly,chromatin organization, and the G2/M transition of the mitotic cell cycle. Meanwhile, more than 50% of identified microproteinswere ncRNA-encoded. These nonannotated novel microproteins contain several function domains, such as the nucleosidediphosphate kinase domain, the high mobility group domain, and the DNA-binding domain. This suggested the potential functionsof these novel microproteins in specific cell cycle stages. This study presented a large-scale profile of microproteins at different cellcycle stages from Hep3B and may provide new perspectives on the regulation mechanism of the cell cycle. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry data were deposited to ProteomeXchange using the identifier PXD030286.

As the play progresses, the protagonist not only becomes a symbol of perceived injustice for the Nigerian and international media, it also transpires that the woman has been interpellated, and actively participates, in a system based on gender inequality and religious bigotry. Drawing on both the dramatic and the theatrical text of the play, this article examines different dimensions of "Islam" as contained, imagined, and staged in Hagel auf Zamfara; it also pays attention to gendered roles, violence, perceptions of justice, and the role of fantasy. Aimed at a largely secular, white, middle-class audience at a German Stadttheater, the production rejected an oversimplified, one-sided staging of "Islam" as "menace" (Said xx), but instead allowed for multiple viewpoints to be expressed in all their contradiction and ambiguity.

TI Pim-1 kinase is a target of miR-486-5p and eukaryotic translation
   initiation factor 4E, and plays a critical role in lung cancer
SO MOLECULAR CANCER
AB Background: Pim-1 kinase is a proto-oncogene and its dysregulation contributes to tumorigenesis and progression of a variety of malignancies. Pim-1 was suggested as a therapeutic target of cancers. The functional relevance of Pim-1 and the mechanism underlying its dysregulation in lung tumorigenesis remained unclear. This study aimed to investigate if Pim-1 has important functions in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by: 1) evaluating the clinicopathologic significance of Pim-1 through analysing its expression in 101 human NSCLCs tissues using quantitative PCR, Western Blot and immunohistochemical studies, 2) determining its role in NSCLC and drug resistance using in vitro assays, and 3) investigating the regulatory mechanism of Pim-1 dysregulation in lung tumorigenesis.
   Results: Pim-1 was upregulated in 66.2% of the lung tumor tissues and its expression was significantly related to advanced stage (P = 0.019) and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.026). Reduced Pim-1 expression suppressed NSCLC cell growth, cell cycle progression and migration in vitro. Pim-1 was a novel target of miR-486-5p determined by luciferase report assay, and ectopic miR-486-5p expression in cancer cells reduced Pim-1 expression. Furthermore, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) controlled the synthesis of Pim-1 in NSCLC cells, and its expression was positively associated with that of Pim-1 in NSCLC tissue specimens (r = 0.504, p < 0.001). The downregulated miR-486-5p and upregulated eIF4E in NSCLC cells led to the overexpression of Pim-1 by relieving the inhibitory effect of the 3'-UTR or 5'-UTR of Pim-1 mRNA, respectively. Moreover, Pim-1 knockdown sensitized NSCLC cells to cisplatin and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, gefitinib.
   Conclusions: Pim-1 kinase could be a critical survival signaling factor in NSCLC, and regulated by miR-486-5p and eIF4E. Pim-1 kinase may provide a potential target for diagnosis and treatment for lung cancer.

TI A Hebrew Take on Shylock on the New York Stage Shylock '47 at the Pargod
   Theatre (1947)
SO EUROPEAN JUDAISM-A JOURNAL FOR THE NEW EUROPE
AB Shylock '47 was a Hebrew-language stage production presented by the Pargod Theatre in New York in 1947. Conceived and directed by Peter Frye, it was a metatheatrical play-within-a-play that interrogated the idea of producing The Merchant of Venice in the aftermath of the Holocaust. It combined original scenes culled from Shimon Halkin's Hebrew translation of Merchant with present-based transitional scenes, created mostly through improvisation and discussion between director and cast. What eventually emerged was a script based on Shakespeare's text with added dramatized discussions about the play's meaning and relevance to Jews at that particular moment in history.

TI A NEW WAVE OF INDIAN INSPIRATION Translations from Urdu in Malay
   Traditional Literature and Theatre
SO INDONESIA AND THE MALAY WORLD
AB In the late 19th century the Malay world experienced a new impact of artistic stimuli from Islamic India. This not only brought to life half a dozen literary works, translation-adaptations from Urdu (Hikayat Gul Bakawali, Syair Indra Sebaha, Hikayat Sultan Bustamam, Hikayat Ganja Mara and some others), but also considerably enriched histrionic culture of the region, in particular through the creation of the Wayang Bangsawan theatre. The influential Indo-Malay community, Jawi Peranakan, played the role of cultural brokers in this process; the Indian Parsi theatre was its major medium. By studying in detail the extant bio-data of translators from Urdu, prototypes and principles of their translations, the history of the Parsi theatre in the Malay world and literary-theatrical interactions within it, the article reveals the paradoxical nature of the new wave of Indian inspiration. On the one hand, this wave contributed a great number of innovations to Malay culture, thus stimulating its modernisation; on the other hand, together with the burgeoning number of lithographs, it marked the beginning of a new (if final) era of flowering of traditional Malay literature. Another issue discussed in the article is the significance of this relatively well-documented stage of the Indo-Malay cultural interface for a better understanding of its earlier stages (for instance in Malacca of the 15th to 16th century or in 17th century Aceh), information of which is still scarce and uncertain.

TI Characterization of proteins involved in early stage of wheat grain
   development by iTRAQ
SO JOURNAL OF PROTEOMICS
AB Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is one of the most important crops in the world due to its value as a major food source. To explore the protein synthesis, accumulation and regulation during grain development are more complex because of its large genome. In this study, grains from wheat cultivar Chinese Spring were harvested at three development stages (DAA4, DAA8 and DAA12) and were used to display variable expressed proteins during these stages. iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic and LC-MS/MS methods were used in this study. A total of 1762 proteins showed that at least 1.5-fold differences in abundance were found during these stages; most of the differential expressed proteins (DEPs) were involved in the metabolism process, which includes carbohydrate metabolism, cell division, cytoskeleton, lipid metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, protein synthesis, signal transduction, translation and transport. The results provide insight into biochemical events taking place during the early wheat grain development and highlight the value of proteomics in characterizing complex biochemical processes. Our results also showed that the photosynthesis played an important role for implying energy during the early grain development.
   Significance: Wheat (T. aestivum L., 2n =6X=42, AABBDD) is one of the most important crops in the world. The early phase of seed grain development mainly involved active cell enlargement, leading to a rapid increase in seed size available for further accumulation of starch of storage proteins. We applied the iTRAQ proteomic analysis to decipher the mechanism of wheat grain development during the early stage. Numerous differentially expressed proteins were identified; most of which were related to carbohydrate metabolism, cell division, cytoskeleton, lipid metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, protein synthesis, signal transduction, translation and transport. Results also showed that the photosynthesis played an important role for implying energy during the early grain development. Taken together, our results provide comprehensive proteome insights into the early wheat grain development. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The discussion of the play focuses on its dependence on oratory, but more especially on the way it projects parallels between Senkatana's life and death and those of Christ, and on the contemporary relevance of the play. Throughout, parallels are drawn between Senkatana and other texts in the Africa Pulse series of translations of southern African classics; there is, too, some comment on the processes of literary translation.

TI Rhythm in translation, with two accounts of Leconte de Lisle's 'Midi'
SO JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN STUDIES
AB This article explores the translation of poetic rhythm: not the rhythm of the source text, but the rhythm of the translational act itself. This re-conception of translation's rhythmic task is enabled by a translation designed for the polyglot, rather than for the monoglot, reader. In this new understanding of translational process, rhythm not only embodies the perceptual and cognitive experience of the translating subject, it also makes more intimate the relationship between language and voice, the linguistic and the paralinguistic. Furthermore, it has as much to do with the space of translation, its distribution on the page, as with its changing temporal modes. The translator, then, does not translate the rhythm of a text so much as a text's capacity for rhythm, and that capacity includes both espousing the perspective of a translating 'I' and releasing what is not linguistically manifest in the source text. These propositions are tested in two translations of Leconte de Lisle's 'Midi'.

TI Corseted Choristry: Arthur Schnitzler's Reigen as Chor(e)ography*
SO GERMAN QUARTERLY
AB Arthur Schnitzler's drama Reigen is primarily known for its explicit content and the scandals it produced. Yet Reigen also reads as an attempt to modernize, and localize, the classical form of the chorus which had not found a place in modern bourgeois theater. Curiously overlooked in studies on literary choruses, the play-its title being one of the possible translations of the Greek chi o rho o sigma (choros)-can in fact be resituated as chi o rho o sigma-literature, as choreo-graphy, as literal transposition of a dance into a series of dialogues. The stringency of its serial format, the attention it gives to movement and location, entering and exiting, up to its suspension of language for the sake of rhythmical notation (- - -) reveal Reigen as theatrical hybrid: as chorus bursting with its copulating individuals. Radically questioning the conventions of "domestic" theater, Schnitzler's Reigen brings to the stage a critique of theatrical genres and conventions that, by the end of the nineteenth century, had clearly outgrown their use.

TI Yin Yang 1 sustains biosynthetic demands during brain development in a
   stage-specific manner
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB The transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) plays an important role in human disease. It is often overexpressed in cancers and mutations can lead to a congenital haploinsufficiency syndrome characterized by craniofacial dysmorphisms and neurological dysfunctions, consistent with a role in brain development. Here, we show that Yy1 controls murine cerebral cortex development in a stage-dependent manner. By regulating a wide range of metabolic pathways and protein translation, Yy1 maintains proliferation and survival of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) at early stages of brain development. Despite its constitutive expression, however, the dependence on Yy1 declines over the course of corticogenesis. This is associated with decreasing importance of processes controlled by Yy1 during development, as reflected by diminished protein synthesis rates at later developmental stages. Thus, our study unravels a novel role for Yy1 as a stage-dependent regulator of brain development and shows that biosynthetic demands of NPCs dynamically change throughout development.

TI More Greek than Jonson thought? Euripides' Medea in The Merchant of
   Venice
SO SHAKESPEARE
AB While Shakespeare clearly borrows from Ovid in The Merchant of Venice, substantial correspondences between Shakespeare's play and Euripides' Medea suggest that this Greek text may have been an equally important source for Shakespeare's Jason/Medea plotlines and invite us to reconsider the foundational assumption that Shakespeare was wholly unfamiliar with Greek drama. Several Latin and French translations of the Attic play circulated during the late sixteenth century, and structural, thematic, and topical parallels between the two dramas provide compelling evidence for a Euripidean influence on Shakespeare's work. Recognizing a Euripidean strain within the play would help to resolve many of the most pressing questions about The Merchant of Venice by providing classical evidence in support of modern readings and performances that highlight Shakespeare's sympathy for the plight of religious, sexual, and racial others.

TI Differentiation of Human iPS Cells Into Sensory Neurons Exhibits
   Developmental Stage-Specific Cryopreservation Challenges
SO FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB Differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) generates cell phenotypes valuable for cell therapy and personalized medicine. Successful translation of these hiPSC-derived therapeutic products will rely upon effective cryopreservation at multiple stages of the manufacturing cycle. From the perspective of cryobiology, we attempted to understand how the challenge of cryopreservation evolves between cell phenotypes along an hiPSC-to-sensory neuron differentiation trajectory. Cells were cultivated at three different stages to represent intermediate, differentiated, and matured cell products. All cell stages remained >= 90% viable in a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-free formulation but suffered >= 50% loss in DMSO before freezing. Raman spectroscopy revealed higher sensitivity to undercooling in hiPSC-derived neuronal cells with lower membrane fluidity and higher sensitivity to suboptimal cooling rates in stem cell developmental stages with larger cell bodies. Highly viable and functional sensory neurons were obtained following DMSO-free cryopreservation. Our study also demonstrated that dissociating adherent cultures plays an important role in the ability of cells to survive and function after cryopreservation.

TI Linguocultural Localization of Movie Titles
SO VESTNIK ROSSIISKOGO UNIVERSITETA DRUZHBY NARODOV-SERIYA
   LINGVISTIKA-RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS
AB Due to intensive growth of film production and the expansion of the "market of film consumption", the need for high-quality translation of feature films into different languages is becoming more and more pressing. While a foreign language film is localized, text elements are not only translated, but also adapted to the culture of the target audience, i.e. we are witnessing transition from one language and cultural code to another. Taking into account their structural, semantic, and functional pragmatic features, film titles are vivid representative materials for the study of modern translation practices in the light of the cultural transference concept (Bassnett 2005, Bastin 1990, Cranmer 2015, Jurt 2007, Katan 1999, Leinen 2007, Thill 2007, Schreiber 1998, Slyshkin, Efremova 2004, Obolenskaya 2013, Snetkova 2009, Fedorova 2009). The purpose of the article is to identify the strategies of linguocultural localization of French film names for the modern Russian-speaking audience, as well as to determine the degree of its adequacy. Regardless of the choice of the translation strategy, the title should correspond to the plot, thematic focus and ideological and figurative content of the film, while remaining interesting and attractive to the audience. We analysed of eighty-seven French feature films of various genre affiliations (detectives, action films, dramas, melodramas, comedies, thrillers and fantasy), released in Russian from 2000 to 2018, and their translation equivalents. We used the methods of semantic, pragmatic, contextual and linguocultural analysis to identify a set of problems arising in the process of localization of film titles and to offer recommendations for their translation into Russian, considering the communicative specifics of the modern film discourse and the ethnic and cultural characteristics of the target audience.

TI "Comme espics dans les plaines": Patterns of Translation of Robert
   Garnier's Epic Similes in Thomas Kyd's Cornelia (1594)
SO RENAISSANCE AND REFORMATION
AB Although celebrated in its time as a worthy contribution to the poetic experiments of the late Elizabethan age, Thomas Kyd's 1594 Cornelia, translated from Robert Garnier's Cornelie (1574), has long been held by modern criticism as a minor work in the playwright's career. Previous attempts to rehabilitate the dramatic and poetic values of Kyd's translation have focused on the metaphoric networks that underlie Kyd's appropriation of Garnier's play or on the political aspects of Kyd's treatment of historical figures and themes. This article examines more specifically Kyd's approach to Garnier's epic similes-many of which are actually borrowed from both classical authors and contemporary poets. By exploring the inter-generic and intertextual connections established in Kyd's translation, this article maps out the literary and cultural trajectories involved in the appropriation and emulation of Continental tragic models, thus highlighting Kyd's experiments with various kinds of drama, clarifying the play's connection with the productions of the Sidney-Herbert "circle," and establishing its significance in late Elizabethan literary culture.

TI Translating Piano Pedagogy Into Biomechanical Language: A Qualitative
   Framework for Interdisciplinary Knowledge Exchange
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITATIVE METHODS
AB Pianists experience high rates of Playing-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders (PRMDs). Biomechanical factors have been investigated by both researchers and music teachers as potentially significant in PRMD development. Knowledge exchange between the fields of music and science about PRMDs may be beneficial, but differences in language use can make interdisciplinary communication challenging. One potential solution is to translate pedagogical ideas into language that is consistent with biomechanical science. Doing so could improve interdisciplinary communication and allow for scientific examination of pedagogical ideas. However, no methods for doing so have been published. To fill this gap, we developed a methodological framework with two stages for translating ideas about piano technique into scientific language: Stage 1 uses Qualitative Content Analysis to summarize pedagogical content; then, Stage 2 includes an "Analysis of Biomechanical Language," in which researchers translate the ideas described in Stage 1. Both stages are collaborative and rely on expert consultation to produce an appropriate translation. This article outlines the framework and explains how it was used in an initial study on the Taubman Approach. Further methodological guidance to assist researchers in future studies is given based on some of the challenges encountered in the initial study. The framework and guidance here will allow researchers to carry out more studies of this kind. Because the framework is newly developed, it will likely need to be adapted further as more studies are done.

TI Hermann Hesse's concept of world literature and his critique on Chinese
   literature
SO NEOHELICON
AB Hermann Hesse drafted in 1927 an outline of world literature in his article Eine Bibliothek der Weltliteratur (A Library of World Literature) in which he took Chinese literature as one of the important sources. In 1935, from German translation of historical novel Water Margins Hesse gave a response to Goethe's ideal of world literature and defined it as the last common spirit "through empathetic translation, to broaden and enrich one's own language and literature". Chinese literature playing this landmark role in Hesse's world literature is not groundless, but closely related with his continuous reading, commenting on a variety of Chinese literature for 30 years in his early career. He praised the perfect form of Chinese poetry, and ascribed Chinese drama to a treasure of stage art. He argued Chinese short narration with the magic to transform freely and broke through reality and illusion. Hesse also evaluated three Chinese romantic fictions The Fortunate Union , The Wonder of the Second-Plum and The Plum in the Golden Vase . He commented twice on the masterpiece Dream of the Red Chamber , initially criticized it was not a classic because it embodied no Chinese wisdom, only afterwards reaffirmed that it was a masterpiece depicting "a mood of decline and fatigue". Hesse's critique on Chinese classical literature not only provides a vision of literary communication between the East and the West, it is also closely related with his cultivation of world literature, which greatly enriches the construction of "world literature" in the early twentieth century.

TI Issues of Transcultural Mobility in Three Recent French Balcony Scenes
SO CONCENTRIC-LITERARY AND CULTURAL STUDIES
AB Romeo and Juliet's translation and staging by Olivier Py (2011), Pascal and Antoine Collin and David Bobee (2012), and Eric Ruf, who staged Francois-Victor Hugo's 1868 version of the play (2016-17), provide a stimulating illustration of recent French translations/adaptations of the Balcony Scene in particular. I examine instances of verbal and non-verbal translation of the canonical texts through such elements such as props, costume, gesture, posture, and the body. They all bring to mind Stephen Greenblatt's concept of "cultural mobility"-first formulated as "cultural transfer" by historians Michel Espagne and Michael Werner in the late 1980s to account for interaction and relations between France and Germany. The scenes particularly seemed to defy previous notions of foreignization or domestication, where the source culture is seen as the "self" and the target culture as the "other," and where the process of domestication tends to erase all "foreignness" from the former. Here, I explore how just three instances of one of the most iconic scenes in Shakespeare is emblematic of a more general cultural mobility in French theatre, thanks to the choice (or choice not) to incorporate French contextual elements in Gallic productions of Shakespeare. I discuss, through the lens of cultural transfer, how the translations repeat or redefine canonical material, and how they show Franco-British stages in contact with one another within the context of contemporary French theatre.

TI Embryonic poly(A)-binding protein interacts with translation-related
   proteins and undergoes phosphorylation on the serine, threonine, and
   tyrosine residues in the mouse oocytes and early embryos
SO JOURNAL OF ASSISTED REPRODUCTION AND GENETICS
AB Expression of the embryonic poly(A)-binding protein (EPAB) in frog, mouse, and human oocytes and early-stage embryos is maintained at high levels until embryonic genome activation (EGA) after which a significant decrease occurs in EPAB levels. Studies on the vertebrate oocytes and early embryos revealed that EPAB plays key roles in the translational regulation, stabilization, and protection of maternal mRNAs during oocyte maturation and early embryogenesis. However, it remains elusive whether EPAB interacts with other cellular proteins and undergoes phosphorylation to perform these roles. For this purpose, we identified a group of Epab-interacting proteins and its phosphorylation status in mouse germinal vesicle (GV)- and metaphase II (MII)-stage oocytes, and in 1-cell, 2-cell, and 4-cell preimplantation embryos. In the oocytes and early preimplantation embryos, Epab-interacting proteins were found to play roles in the translation and transcription processes, intracellular signaling and transport, maintenance of structural integrity, metabolism, posttranslational modifications, and chromatin remodeling. Moreover, we discovered that Epab undergoes phosphorylation on the serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues, which are localized in the RNA recognition motifs 2, 3, and 4 or C-terminal. Conclusively, these findings suggest that Epab not only functions in the translational control of maternal mRNAs through binding to their poly(A) tails but also participates in various cellular events through interacting with certain group proteins. Most likely, Epab undergoes a dynamic phosphorylation during the oocyte maturation and the early embryo development to carry out these functions.

TI High Paip1 Expression as a Potential Prognostic Marker in Hepatocellular
   Carcinoma
SO IN VIVO
AB Background/Aim: Translation plays an important role in the carcinogenesis of various human tumors. Paip1 and eIF4A1 are translation-associated proteins that mediate the function of eukaryotic initiation factor 4F complex. This study aimed to analyse the relationship between the expression status of Paip1 and eIF4A1 and clinicopathologic features in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Materials and Methods: Immunohistochemical analysis was used to evaluate the expression status of Paip1 and eIF4A1. Two pathologists independently interpreted the immunostained slides. The prognostic value of Paip1 and eIF4A1 was evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier plotter. Results: Among 173 HCC patients, 28 (16.1%) and 46 (26.6%) belonged in the Paip1 and eIF4A1 high-expression groups. High expression of Paip1 and eIF4A1 was associated with advanced TNM stage and more frequent vascular tumor invasion. Univariate analysis indicated that high Paip1 expression was associated with worse five-year overall survival (OS). Public dataset analysis by Kaplan-Meier plotter revealed that high mRNA expression of Paip1, and not of eIF4A1, was significantly associated with worse five-year OS and disease-free survival. Conclusion: Paip1 expression has a potential prognostic value in human HCC.

TI 'Adaptations' of Henrik Ibsen: Arthur Miller and John Osborne
SO PERSPECTIVES-STUDIES IN TRANSLATION THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB The American dramatist Arthur Miller was a declared admirer of Ibsen, whose influence on his own drama is obvious. He also tried to reintroduce Ibsen in America, producing a version of An Enemy of the People in 1951 shortly before his own masterpiece, The Crucible. In this article, I intend to compare Miller's version with the original and try to account for the deviations which I uncover. I will also include a short discussion of an Ibsen translation by another dramatist, John Osborne, in order to compare his approach to Ibsen with Miller's. One thing which has interested me in this connection is the fact that both Miller and Osborne refer to their versions as 'adaptations'.

TI Shakespeare in Hawai'i: Puritans, Missionaries, and Language Trouble in
   James Grant Benton's Twelf Nite O Wateva!, a Hawaiian Pidgin Translation
   of Twelfth Night
SO MULTICULTURAL SHAKESPEARE-TRANSLATION APPROPRIATION AND PERFORMANCE
AB In 1974, the Honolulu-based director James Grant Benton wrote and staged Twelf Nite O Wateva!, a Hawaiian pidgin translation of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night. In Benton's translation, Malolio (Malvolio) strives to overcome his reliance on pidgin English in his efforts to ascend the Islands' class hierarchy. In doing so, Malolio alters his native pidgin in order to sound more haole (white). Using historical models of Protestant identity and Shakespeare's original text, Benton explores the relationship between pidgin language and social privilege in contemporary Hawai'i. In the first part of this essay, I argue that Benton characterizes Malolio's social aspirations against two historical moments of religious conflict and struggle: post-Reformation England and post-contact Hawai'i. In particular, I show that Benton aligns historical caricatures of early modern puritans with cultural views of Protestant missionaries from New England who arrived in Hawai'i beginning in the 1820s. In the essay's second part, I demonstrate that Benton crafts Malolio's pretentious pidgin by modeling it on Shakespeare's own language. During his most ostentatious outbursts, Malolio's lines consist of phrases extracted nearly verbatim from Shakespeare's original play. In Twelf Nite, Shakespeare's language becomes a model for speech that is inauthentic, affected, and above all, haole.

TI Different activity patterns control various stages of Reelin synthesis
   in the developing neocortex
SO CEREBRAL CORTEX
AB Reelin is a large extracellular matrix protein abundantly expressed in the developing neocortex of mammals. During embryonic and early postnatal stages in mice, Reelin is secreted by a transient neuronal population, the Cajal-Retzius neurons (CRs), and is mostly known to insure the inside-out migration of neurons and the formation of cortical layers. During the first 2 postnatal weeks, CRs disappear from the neocortex and a subpopulation of GABAergic neurons takes over the expression of Reelin, albeit in lesser amounts. Although Reelin expression requires a tight regulation in a time- and cell-type specific manner, the mechanisms regulating the expression and secretion of this protein are poorly understood. In this study, we establish a cell-type specific profile of Reelin expression in the marginal zone of mice neocortex during the first 3 postnatal weeks. We then investigate whether electrical activity plays a role in the regulation of Reelin synthesis and/or secretion by cortical neurons during the early postnatal period. We show that increased electrical activity promotes the transcription of reelin via the brain-derived neurotrophic factor/TrkB pathway, but does not affect its translation or secretion. We further demonstrate that silencing the neuronal network promotes the translation of Reelin without affecting the transcription or secretion. We conclude that different patterns of activity control various stages of Reelin synthesis, whereas its secretion seems to be constitutive.

TI Satire and Embodiment: Allegorical Romance on Stage and Page in
   Mid-Eighteenth-Century Britain
SO EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY FICTION
AB Theatrical presentation of character relies on embodiment and mimesis where the novel constructs plausible character through the diegetic presentation of consciousness and action. This article argues that, with the introduction of stage censorship in the 1730s, allegorical prose romance mediates the transition from theatrical to novelistic modes of rendering plausible embodied character. Theatre and the novel in the mid-eighteenth century share a preoccupation with the relation of embodiment to allegorical abstraction, often represented in the figure of the Quixote, who mistakes one for the other. This essay charts the translation of techniques found in Henry Fielding's satirical allegory in his short stage plays of the 1730s with three allegorical romances of 1736 that take Frederick, Prince of Wales, and his new bride, Princess Augusta of Saxa-Gothe-Altenburg, as the hero and heroine: Celenia and Hyempsal, The Adventures of Prince Titi, and The Adventures of Eovaai. Discursive play with the magical rein-carnation of "dead" figures in new forms of embodimentpuppets, ghosts, supernatural visitation-is central to these acts of generic transformation. Allegory, as we see in Sarah Fielding and Jane Collier's The Cry (1754), has an unacknowledged afterlife in the mid-century novel.

TI Irish Theatre in Italy during the Second World War: translation and
   politics
SO MODERN ITALY
AB Irish drama underwent an extraordinary rediscovery in Italy during the Second World War, primarily because of its political convenience (Ireland was a neutral nation) but also because of its aesthetic significance. Through an analysis of the role of key mediators I employ Irish literature as a lens to investigate a crucial moment of renewal within both Italian politics and theatre, emphasising strands of continuity between Fascist and post-Fascist practices. First, I show how a wartime ban on English and American plays prompted an interest in Irish drama and the fluid status of the Irish canon enabled authors of Irish origin (e.g. Eugene O'Neill), to be affiliated with Irish literature. I then move on to considering how this very fluidity facilitated the daring rebranding of Irish theatre as anti-fascist in Paolo Grassi's Collezione Teatro', a key step in his position-taking at the centre of Italy's theatrical field. Ireland was a substitute for England and appeared on Italian (political and literary) maps mainly thanks to its anti-English function. However, despite the politically inflected motivation of the various, often contrasting uses of the category Irish drama' in wartime Italy, this was the first time Irish literature had been widely acknowledged as a specific tradition within the Anglosphere in Italy.

TI mTOR signaling regulates Zika virus replication bidirectionally through
   autophagy and protein translation
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY
AB Zika virus (ZIKV) reemerged in 2016 and attracted much more attention worldwide. To date, the limited knowledge of ZIKV interactions with host cells in the early stages of infection impedes the prevention of viral epidemics and the treatment of ZIKV disease. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway plays an essential role in the regulation of autophagy and protein synthesis during multiple viral infections. This study aimed to investigate the functional role of mTOR signaling in ZIKV replication in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Immunoblotting demonstrated that ZIKV infection inhibited mTORC1 signaling, enhancing autophagy but obstructing protein translation. Drugs or siRNA for interfering with mTOR signaling molecules were utilized to demonstrate that AKT/TSC2/mTORC1 signaling was involved in ZIKV infection and that autophagy promoted ZIKV production, but viral protein expression was regulated by mTORC1 signaling. Moreover, confocal microscopy indicated a robust correlation between autophagy and viral RNA transcription. This study clarifies the dual functions of mTOR signaling during ZIKV infection and provides theoretical support for developing potential anti-ZIKV drugs based on mTOR signaling molecules and deeper insights to better understand the mechanism between ZIKV and host cells.

TI Translation Initiation Factor 3 Regulates Switching between Different
   Modes of Ribosomal Subunit Joining
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB Ribosomal subunit joining is a key checkpoint in the bacterial translation initiation pathway during which initiation factors (IFs) regulate association of the 30S initiation complex (IC) with the 50S subunit to control formation of a 70S IC that can enter into the elongation stage of protein synthesis. The GTP-bound form of IF2 accelerates subunit joining, whereas IF3 antagonizes subunit joining and plays a prominent role in maintaining translation initiation fidelity. The molecular mechanisms through which IF2 and IF3 collaborate to regulate the efficiency of 70S IC formation, including how they affect the dynamics of subunit joining, remain poorly defined. Here, we use single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer to monitor the interactions between IF2 and the GTPase-associated center (GAC) of the 50S subunit during real-time subunit joining reactions in the absence and presence of IF3. In the presence of IF3, IF2-mediated subunit joining becomes reversible, and subunit joining events cluster into two distinct classes corresponding to formation of shorter- and longer-lifetime 70S ICs. Inclusion of IF3 within the 30S IC was also found to alter the conformation of IF2 relative to the GAC, suggesting that IF3's regulatory effects may stem in part from allosteric modulation of IF2-GAC interactions. The results are consistent with a model in which IF3 can exert control over the efficiency of subunit joining by modulating the conformation of the 30S IC, which in turn influences the formation of stabilizing intersubunit contacts and thus the reaction's degree of reversibility.

SO SOTSIOLOGICHESKIE ISSLEDOVANIYA
AB Ionin's monograph "The Drama of Max Weber's Life" reveals a number of aspects of Weber's life and work that are new to Russian web studies, related to both deeply personal and professional and socio-political conflicts. The review analyzes the problems of professional self-determination faced by Weber and his attitude to political activity. The fate of Weber's scientific heritage is considered in the context of contradictions in the development of modern science, including the problems of translation and the language of science in the global world. Here the author gives very valuable comments on the translation of some concepts introduced into science by Weber. It is shown that the inevitability of the transformation of some of his ideas into "pop sociology" is due to both the formation of mass society and the problems of the development of the institute of science. The problems of rationalization and "disenchantment of the world" are considered as the central idea of Weber's work, special attention is paid to L.G. lonin's interpretation of Weber's little-known statements about the relationship of eroticism and rationality, about "erotic domination", in the context of collisions of the scientist's personal life.

SO BIOENGINEERED
AB Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A2 (eIF5A2) plays an important role in tumor progression and prognosis evaluation. However, the potential role of eIF5A2 in human papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is unknown. In this study, we aim to investigate the association between eIF5A2 expression and PTC clinical outcomes and underlying its Biological function in PTC cells in vitro and in vivo. The expression of eIF5A2 was examined by immunohistochemistry in PTC tissues and its adjacent tissue (n = 39) from 207 PTC patients. Functional analysis of eIF5A2 was performed in PTC cell lines in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that eIF5A2 was overexpressed in PTC tissues compared with the adjacent tissues. Enhanced eIF5A2 expression was significantly correlated with extrathyroidal extension (p = 0.012), lymph node metastasis (p = 0.002), TNM stage (p = 0.006), T classification (p = 0.047) and BRAF V600E mutation (p = 0.036). EIF5A2 inhibition prevented PTC cell growth, invasiveness and migration and induced cell apoptosis in vitro. Furthermore, eIF5A2 depletion inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. The data indicated that eIF5A2 could be employed as a novel prognostic marker and effective therapeutic target for PTC.

TI Oedipus the Fox
SO CALIGRAMA-REVISTA DE ESTUDOS ROMANICOS
AB The article aims at selecting excerpts from Sophocles' play Oedipus Tyrannus, starred here as Oedipus the fox, and translating them. The leitmotiv that directs the selection is the confrontation of the plague by the ruler. As it is well known, the Sophoclean text, and particularly that which refers to the drama of Oedipus, is difficult to translate. Sophocles uses the power of the lexical and syntactic meanings of the Greek language to the maximum, starting with the title that came to us for the play which would give a treatise - if we focus on it only with the adjective (which is not an adjective, but a noun used as an adjective) (sic). The Oedipus king translation is neutralizing; the Oedipus tyrant translation is too biased, too captious, and too political for a term that could be translated in other ways such as the one we chose. In turn, the word Oedipus, etymologically, gives rise to incredible and pertinent variations if we choose to translate it. The article does not intend to discuss philology nor literature in depth, I will just go with a translation proposal to show the relevance of Oedipus for Brazil in a pandemic.

SO FEBS OPEN BIO
AB Ovarian cancer is the most common cause of gynaecological cancer-associated death; thus, promising biomarkers and new therapeutic targets for ovarian cancer must be explored. Here, we report that eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit D (EIF3D), a member of the EIF3 family, was overexpressed in ovarian cancer clinical tissues. Furthermore, the expression of EIF3D was correlated with the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage and pathological differentiation stage. 3(4,5-dimethylthylthiazol-2-yl)-2 (MTT) and colony formation assays revealed that the lentivirus-mediated knockdown of EIF3D suppresses cell proliferation in the ovarian tumour cell lines CAOV-3 and SKOV-3. Flow cytometry revealed that cells were arrested at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and that cyclin-dependent kinase 1 was also altered after EIF3D silencing. The results presented here demonstrate that EIF3D may play an important role in the occurrence and development of ovarian cancer.

TI German Music Manuals in 18th Century Russian Translations: about the
   Attributes of the Primary Texts
SO PROBLEMY MUZYKALNOI NAUKI-MUSIC SCHOLARSHIP
AB The first Russian translations of German musical treatises were published in the last third of the 18th century: these were the textbooks on clavier playing by Georg Simon Lohlein, and Daniel Gottlob Turk, and a guide to figured bass performance written by David Kelner. Despite the obviousness of the information about the original texts of the translated publications, the problem of attributing the primary text remains relevant for each of them. Its staging is due to the fact that the German treatises by the time of the publication of their versions in Russian underwent numerous publications, which were not stereotyped. Since the title data of the Russian versions do not contain information about the numbers and dates of the publications of the original sources, establishing the latter has become an important scholarly task. Its relevance is indisputable: without turning to the texts in the original language, it would be impossible to carry out an exhaustive study of the range of translated 18th century literature, especially those aspects that are associated with identifying the specific features of translation, its technique and quality, the degree of structural correspondence to the original source, and the means of translating terminology.
   For the sake of attribution of the originals, a comparative analysis of the German editions published prior to the appearance of the Russian versions has been carried out. As a result of their correlation with the translations, the following primary texts have been specified: Lohlein, Georg Simon, Clavier-Schule, oder kurze und gruendliche Anweisung zur Melodie und Harmonie (first edition, 1765); Kellner David, Treulicher Unterricht im General-Ba ss (first edition, 1732); Turk Daniel Gottlob, Kurze Anweisung zum Klavierspielen, ein Auszug aus der gro ss ern Klavierschule (1792).
   A positive reliance on German primary sources will make it possible to take a fresh look at the results of the translation work, come closer to their objective assessment, and also may help increase the degree of the scholarly veracity of contemporary research works.

TI After the crash: Research-based theater for knowledge transfer
SO JOURNAL OF CONTINUING EDUCATION IN THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS
AB Introduction: The aim of this project was to develop and evaluate a research-based dramatic production for the purpose of transferring knowledge about traumatic brain injury (TBI) to health care professionals, managers, and decision makers.
   Methods: Using results drawn from six focus group discussions with key stakeholders (consumers, informal care-givers, and health care practitioners experienced in the field of TBI) and relevant scientific literature, a 50-minute play was produced for the purpose of conveying the experiences of TBI survivors, informal care providers, and health practitioners and best practice for TBI care. A self-administered postperformance survey was distributed to audience members at the end of four performances in Ontario, Canada, to evaluate the play's efficacy. Two hundred ninety-one questionnaires were completed. The questionnaire had five questions scored on a 5-item Likert scale with space for open-ended comments.
   Results: Consistently high mean scores from the questionnaires indicate that theater is a highly efficacious and engaging method of knowledge transfer, particularly for complex material that deals with human emotion and interpersonal relationships.
   Discussion: Responses supported the effectiveness of drama as a knowledge translation strategy and identified its potential to impact practice positively.

TI ARISTOPHANES ON THE CZECH STAGE BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND WORLD WAR,
   AND DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR
SO LISTY FILOLOGICKE
AB Since the end of the Second World War, well over eighty performances of Aristophanes's plays have been staged, meaning that ancient Greek comedy has become a permanent part of the Czech theatrical repertory. Over the course of more than eighty years, Aristophanes's plays have been staged almost every year, with four performances in different locations in the Republic being unexceptional. Lysistrata alone has been performed at least forty-five times since the end of the war, a figure comparable with performances of Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream.(42)
   In the interwar period and during the Second World War the name of Aristophanes was associated with many directorial personalities, among whom Karel Capek and Jiff Frejka excelled, together with significant artists like Josef Capek and Antonin Heythum. Aristophanes comedy in translation by Ferdinand Stiebitz became the new novel material and a source of opportunities for the emerging generation of Czech avant-garde theatre; moreover, the stage performances on several occasions served as a pacifist manifesto (Frejka, Podhorsky) in difficult times of impending fascism.

TI Bridging the gap between non-professional subtitling and translator
   training: A collaborative approach
SO INTERPRETER AND TRANSLATOR TRAINER
AB The impact of technology on audiovisual translation has been enormous, and it continues to change not only audiovisual production and distribution models but also the profile of the translator and the concept of audience. The development of new digital technologies has led to the emergence of internet communities of non-professional translators who subtitle popular TV series and films using freeware and sharing their collective intelligence. This article describes a teaching project which investigates the potential benefits of integrating activities inspired by non-professional subtitling into a formal teaching context. Making the most of their knowledge as fans as well as of their linguistic skills and socio-cultural awareness, students work in teams to produce interlingual subtitles for different episodes from a variety of TV series, including comedy, medical drama, crime and science fiction. Such collaborative approach, based on a social constructivist view of translator training, has important pedagogical implications for areas such as translator competence, student motivation and learner autonomy.

TI eIF4E and eIF4GI have distinct and differential imprints on multiple
   myeloma's proteome and signaling
SO ONCOTARGET
AB Accumulating data indicate translation plays a role in cancer biology, particularly its rate limiting stage of initiation. Despite this evolving recognition, the function and importance of specific translation initiation factors is unresolved. The eukaryotic translation initiation complex eIF4F consists of eIF4E and eIF4G at a 1:1 ratio. Although it is expected that they display interdependent functions, several publications suggest independent mechanisms.
   This study is the first to directly assess the relative contribution of eIF4F components to the expressed cellular proteome, transcription factors, microRNAs, and phenotype in a malignancy known for extensive protein synthesis-multiple myeloma (MM). Previously, we have shown that eIF4E/eIF4GI attenuation (siRNA/Avastin) deleteriously affected MM cells' fate and reduced levels of eIF4E/eIF4GI established targets. Here, we demonstrated that eIF4E/eIF4GI indeed have individual influences on cell proteome. We used an objective, high throughput assay of mRNA microarrays to examine the significance of eIF4E/eIF4GI silencing to several cellular facets such as transcription factors, microRNAs and phenotype. We showed different imprints for eIF4E and eIF4GI in all assayed aspects. These results promote our understanding of the relative contribution and importance of eIF4E and eIF4GI to the malignant phenotype and shed light on their function in eIF4F translation initiation complex.

TI The Silent Noras: Women of the First Chinese Performance of A Doll's
   House
SO ASIAN THEATRE JOURNAL
AB This article analyzes the first fully verifiable Ibsen performance in the history of Chinese theatre-Nala (Nora) in Beijing in 1923-by a group of female students from the famous Beijing Nuzi Gaodeng Shifan Xuexiao (Peking Normal College for Women). Among scholars of Chinese theatre, this performance has often been overlooked and deemed insignificant. I argue that this performance is significant not only because it sets an example for the hundred-year Ibsen performance tradition on the Chinese stage but also because it challenged the public perception of women in theatre. This article takes issue with the dominant discourse on Ibsen's role in Chinese women's liberation, where men-the "new youth" and by and large "Ibsenites"-liberated women. It reorients the women as the pioneers of staging Ibsen in Chinese theatre. Based on first-hand archival research, I present a detailed theatre historiography of the performance while contextualizing it in the lived realities of the female students at PNCW at that time.
   Liyang Xia is Associate Professor at the Centre for Ibsen Studies, University of Oslo. Her research areas include the reception history of Ibsen's drama in Chinese theatre, Chinese traditional theatre, and its practice both historically and in contemporary China, and modern adaptations of Ibsen's drama around the world. She is a coauthor of the forthcoming book Visualizing Lost Theatres: Virtual Praxis and the Recovery of Performance Spaces (Cambridge University Press, 2021), which is part of a project that rebuilds-in virtual reality-five theatre venues around the world that no longer exist. She is also a translator. Her translations of Ibsen's plays Peer Gynt (cotranslator Zhiquan Xia) and Et dukkehjem (A Doll's House), directly from Norwegian to Chinese, were published in September 2018.

TI Novel reference genes in colorectal cancer identify a distinct subset of
   high stage tumors and their associated histologically normal colonic
   tissues
SO BMC MEDICAL GENETICS
AB Background Reference genes are often interchangeably called housekeeping genes due to 1) the essential cellular functions their proteins provide and 2) their constitutive expression across a range of normal and pathophysiological conditions. However, given the proliferative drive of malignant cells, many reference genes such as beta-actin (ACTB) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase (GAPDH) which play critical roles in cell membrane organization and glycolysis, may be dysregulated in tumors versus their corresponding normal controls Methods Because Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology has several advantages over hybridization-based technologies, such as independent detection and quantitation of transcription levels, greater sensitivity, and increased dynamic range, we evaluated colorectal cancers (CRC) and their histologically normal tissue counterparts by NGS to evaluate the expression of 21 "classical" reference genes used as normalization standards for PCR based methods. Seventy-nine paired tissue samples of CRC and their patient matched healthy colonic tissues were subjected to NGS analysis of their mRNAs. Results We affirmed that 17 out of 21 classical reference genes had upregulated expression in tumors compared to normal colonic epithelial tissue and dramatically so in some cases. Indeed, tumors were distinguished from normal controls in both unsupervised hierarchical clustering analyses (HCA) and principal component analyses (PCA). We then identified 42 novel potential reference genes with minimal coefficients of variation (CV) across 79 CRC tumor pairs. Though largely consistently expressed across tumors and normal control tissues, a subset of high stage tumors (HSTs) as well as some normal tissue samples (HSNs) located adjacent to these HSTs demonstrated dysregulated expression, thus identifying a subset of tumors with a potentially distinct and aggressive biological profile. Conclusion While classical CRC reference genes were found to be differentially expressed between tumors and normal controls, novel reference genes, identified via NGS, were more consistently expressed across malignant and normal colonic tissues. Nonetheless, a subset of HST had profound dysregulation of such genes as did many of the histologically normal tissues adjacent to such HSTs, indicating that the HSTs so distinguished may have unique biological properties and that their histologically normal tissues likely harbor a small population of microscopically undetected but metabolically active tumors.

TI Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF-4E) expressions are
   associated with poor prognosis in colorectal adenocarcinoma
SO PATHOLOGY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
AB Both phosphorylated 4E binding protein 1 (p-4E-BP1) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF-4E) play an important role in cancer progression. The aim of this study is to evaluate the expression of p-4E-BP1 and eIF-4E in human colorectal cancer (CRC) and to assess their clinical significance. Expression levels of two markers were analyzed in surgical specimens from 116 CRC cases by immunohistochemical staining. Their clinical significance as well as the two proteins' correlation was also investigated. Western blot was also used to detect the protein expressions in CRC cell lines. High p-4E-BP1 expression was significantly associated with lymphovascular invasion (LVI) (p = 0.003), perineural invasion (PNI) (p = 0.001), tumor stage (p = 0.024), nodal stage (p = 0.000), metastatic status (p = 0.027), and disease stage (p = 0.001). High elF-4E expression had significant correlations with LVI (p = 0.001), PNI (p = 0.008), nodal stage (p = 0.018), metastatic status (p = 0.024) and disease stage (p = 0.030). Pearson correlation calculations showed a weakly positive correlation between p-4E-BP1 and eIF-4E immunoreactivity (p = 0.037). Patients with low eIF-4E expressions tended to have significantly longer overall survival (p = 0.039). Western blot analysis showed higher expression of p-4E-BP1 and elF-4E proteins in CRC cell lines compared with normal colon tissue. In conclusions, high expressions of eIF-4E are associated with advanced stage and poor prognosis. These data suggest that eIF-4E may provide a helpful therapeutic target in treatment of CRC.

TI Downregulation of protein kinase PKR activation by porcine reproductive
   and respiratory syndrome virus at its early stage infection
SO VETERINARY MICROBIOLOGY
AB The interferon-induced double-strand RNA activated protein kinase (PKR) plays an important role in antiviral response. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) on PKR activation. Here we report that PRRSV inhibited PKR activation during its early stage infection of primary pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs). PRRSV infection led to lower level of phosphorylated PKR in comparison with mock-infected cells. The PKR inhibition was sustained until 10 h post infection in the presence of polyl:C, a synthetic analog of double stranded RNA activating PKR. PKR-mediated phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2 alpha was also lower in the PRRSV-infected PAMs during the early stage infection. Interestingly, inactivated PRRSV was capable to inhibit the PKR activation until 6 h post infection. This suggests that structural components of PRRSV virions were responsible for the inhibition, although PRRSV replication was needed for longer inhibition. These results indicate that the downregulation of PKR activation during early infection stage should be essential for PRRSV to avoid the antiviral response to initiate replication. This finding contributes to our understanding on PRRSV interaction with host innate immune response and reveal a target for control of PRRSV infection. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Brown, Never Black: Othello on the Nazi Stage
SO MULTICULTURAL SHAKESPEARE-TRANSLATION APPROPRIATION AND PERFORMANCE
AB This paper examines the ways in which Othello was represented on the Nazi stage. Included in the theatre analyses are Othello productions in Frankfurt in 1935, in Berlin in 1939 and 1944, and in pre-occupation Vienna in 1935. New archival material has been sourced from archives in the aforementioned locations, in order to give detailed insights into the representation of Othello on stage, with a special focus on the makeup that was used on the actors who were playing the titular role. The aim of these analyses is not only to establish what Othello looked like on the Nazi and pre-Nazi stage, but also to examine the Nazis' relationship with Shakespeare's Othello within the wider context of their relationship with the Black people who lived in Nazi Germany at the time. In addition, the following pages offer insights into pre-Nazi, Weimar productions of Othello in order to create a more complex and comparative understanding of Nazi Othello productions and the wider theatrical context within which they were produced. In the end, we find out, based on existing evidence, why Othello was brown, and never Black.

TI Translating under Constraints: Joseph Laudes' Work for the Vienna Court
   Stages in the 1760s and 1770s
SO COMPARATIVE CRITICAL STUDIES
AB Joseph Laudes is an example of an eighteenth-century translator for the two Vienna court stages who had to work under a number of constraints: he had to adapt to a particular theory of theatre, to the demands of certain managers and authorities, as well as to the needs of the audience. The theatre reform that was being implemented in the period of Laudes' activities as a translator demanded prose instead of verse drama. Moreover, this reform favoured sentimental comedies aimed at affecting the sentiments of the audience and teaching them morally correct behaviour. Besides poetological and ideological constraints, the dramatic texts were directed at a public composed of the aristocracy and a growing number of members of the bourgeoisie. Since he had to work under intense time pressure, which affected the quality of his texts, many of the characteristics of his work correspond with those of prose translations of the era, published by what critics denounced as 'translation factories'. Laudes' translation work is exemplified by his rendering of Goldoni's Pamela maritata.

TI The Effects of Open Captions in a Medical Drama on the Acquisition of
   Medical Terminology about Chronic Health Conditions Related to Physical
   Injury
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH EDUCATION
AB Background: Despite previous efforts to improve health literacy through entertainment media, current practice seems to address only a few public health topics. Purpose: We examined the impact of supplementary open captions about medical terminology related to physical injuries that might lead to chronic health conditions on the acquisition and retention of relevant information presented in a medical drama. Methods: We conducted a two-group, between-subjects experiment (no open captions vs. open captions) with 150 adult participants to measure how open captions might help viewers retain medical information without disrupting their enjoyment of the storyline. Results: The open captions helped viewers retain the terms and their definitions without disrupting narrative transportation to the events in the episode. Discussion: As long as the open-captioned medical information was seamlessly woven into the storyline of the episode, it did not prevent the viewers from appreciating the dramatic content of the show. Translation to Health Education Practice: Health educators are encouraged to collaborate with media producers to implement open captions for health and medical information rather than simply monitoring the accuracy of health and medical topics featured in television shows.

TI Phosphorylated S6K1 and 4E-BP1 play different roles in constitutively
   active Rheb-mediated retinal ganglion cell survival and axon
   regeneration after optic nerve injury
SO NEURAL REGENERATION RESEARCH
AB Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) is a small GTPase that activates mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Previous studies have shown that constitutively active Rheb can enhance the regeneration of sensory axons after spinal cord injury by activating downstream effectors of mTOR. S6K1 and 4E-BP1 are important downstream effectors of mTORC1. In this study, we investigated the role of Rheb/mTOR and its downstream effectors S6K1 and 4E-BP1 in the protection of retinal ganglion cells. We transfected an optic nerve crush mouse model with adeno-associated viral 2-mediated constitutively active Rheb and observed the effects on retinal ganglion cell survival and axon regeneration. We found that overexpression of constitutively active Rheb promoted survival of retinal ganglion cells in the acute (14 days) and chronic (21 and 42 days) stages of injury. We also found that either co-expression of the dominant-negative S6K1 mutant or the constitutively active 4E-BP1 mutant together with constitutively active Rheb markedly inhibited axon regeneration of retinal ganglion cells. This suggests that mTORC1-mediated S6K1 activation and 4E-BP1 inhibition were necessary components for constitutively active Rheb-induced axon regeneration. However, only S6K1 activation, but not 4E-BP1 knockdown, induced axon regeneration when applied alone. Furthermore, S6K1 activation promoted the survival of retinal ganglion cells at 14 days post-injury, whereas 4E-BP1 knockdown unexpectedly slightly decreased the survival of retinal ganglion cells at 14 days post-injury. Overexpression of constitutively active 4E-BP1 increased the survival of retinal ganglion cells at 14 days post-injury. Likewise, co-expressing constitutively active Rheb and constitutively active 4E-BP1 markedly increased the survival of retinal ganglion cells compared with overexpression of constitutively active Rheb alone at 14 days post-injury. These findings indicate that functional 4E-BP1 and S6K1 are neuroprotective and that 4E-BP1 may exert protective effects through a pathway at least partially independent of Rheb/mTOR. Together, our results show that constitutively active Rheb promotes the survival of retinal ganglion cells and axon regeneration through modulating S6K1 and 4E-BP1 activity. Phosphorylated S6K1 and 4E-BP1 promote axon regeneration but play an antagonistic role in the survival of retinal ganglion cells.

TI EXPERIENCE OF GROOVE QUESTIONNAIRE: GERMAN TRANSLATION AND VALIDATION
SO MUSIC PERCEPTION
AB IN RECENT EMPIRICAL RESEARCH, THE EXPERIENCE of groove (i.e., the pleasant sense of wanting to move along with the music) has come into focus. By developing the new Experience of Groove Questionnaire (EGQ), Senn et al. (2020) have provided a standardized and validated research instrument for future studies, consisting of the two correlated factors Urge to Move and Pleasure. The present study reports the translation of the English version into German and a validation with a German sample (N = 455). The original version's factor structure was confirmed by the German data. Test-retest reliability was found to be high (r(tt) > .85) for both factors. To determine convergent validity, two other scales were included: The Drum Pattern Quality Scale (Friihauf, Kopiez, & Platz, 2013) and the Aesthetic Emotions Scale (Schindler et al., 2017) showed high correlations (.78 < r < .87) with the two factors of the EGQ and therefore indicated convergent validity. We conclude that the German version shows good psychometric properties and recommend its use for future research on the experience of groove.

TI Partido: Italo Calvino's Turned Page
SO EIXO E A RODA-REVISTA DE LITERATURA BRASILEIRA
AB This paper aims to present an analysis of the play Partido, performed by the theatrical group Galpao, from Belo Horizonte, and conceived from the novel The cloven viscount, by Italo Calvino. With dramaturgy by Cacti Brandao and directed by Cacti Carvalho, the show, perceived here as a translation of Calvino's work, contributed to the reception of the italian writer in Brazil. From the text to the stage, creators worked on transforming the original text in such a way that allowed Galpao to surpass the book, subverting it in some way. The written word was translated into a language that favored actors' bodies and life experiences. The translation was analyzed from the thoughts of Walter Benjamin, Paul Ricouer and Haroldo de Campos, highlighting the Minas Gerais group work as a poetic translation based on the production of the different.

TI Atomic Mutagenesis of the Ribosome: Towards a Molecular Understanding of
   Translation
SO CHIMIA
AB The multifaceted repertoire of non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in organisms of all three domains of life emphasizes their fundamental role in biology. Research in my lab focuses on revealing the regulatory and catalytic function of small and large ncRNAs in different model organisms. In particular we are interested in understanding ncRNA/protein complexes such as the vault complex or the ribosome. The ribosome, the central enzyme of protein biosynthesis, is a multifunctional ribonucleoprotein particle composed of two unequal subunits that translates the genome's message into all proteins needed for life. The crucial role the translation machinery plays in gene expression is also mirrored by the fact that the ribosome represents the main target for antibiotics. Decades of genetic, biochemical and recent crystallographic studies revealed the ribosome as an RNA-enzyme with roots in the 'RNA world'. Despite these experimental insights, the catalytic and regulatory mechanisms of the ribosomal RNA are still not fully understood at the molecular level. To unravel the detailed contributions of rRNA nucleotides for protein synthesis we have developed and applied an 'atomic mutagenesis' approach. This tool allows the role of specific 23S rRNA functional groups and even individual atoms to be studied during various stages of the ribosomal elongation cycle with thus far unequalled precision. This experimental approach bridges the disciplines of biochemistry and organic chemistry and has recently revealed specific functional 23S rRNA groups involved in peptide bond synthesis, peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis, GTPase activation, and tRNA translocation.

TI Im/politeness, gender and power distance in Lady Windermere's Fan
SO TRANSLATION AND TRANSLANGUAGING IN MULTILINGUAL CONTEXTS
AB Im/politeness has attracted considerable attention over the past decades (starting with Lakoff 1973; Brown and Levinson 1978; Leech 1983) and has kept expanding rapidly with the discursive turn (Eden 2001; Mills 2003; Watts 2003; Bousfield 2008; Locher 2008). There is a growing interest in examining im/politeness from a number of perspectives, e.g. society, gender, cross-cultural etc., and multiple definitions have been proposed, however, impoliteness as such has not had a distinct theoretical framework yet.
   This study investigates impoliteness through drama translation data. It focuses on manipulation of im/politeness in target versions of a playtext, in terms of gender, and examines how humour may be facilitated through such shifts. The aim is to confirm that impoliteness does interact with gender (Mills 2003), and that humour creation draws on reversed gender stereotypes. It also shows that power (ensuing from reversed gender stereotypes) interacts with impoliteness strategies, to manifest humour in the target versions. The study uses Bousfield's (2008) model to account for im/politeness shifts, between the two versions.
   Oscar Wilde's Lady Windermere's Fan (1892) is a comedy and a satire targeting the aristocratic society of the time. The two Greek translations of the play (2006 by Karhadakis and 2010 by Belies) are a most suitable context for examining how impoliteness interacts with power distance and gender to create humour, because of its humorous aspects and cross-gender talk. The paper also intends to show impoliteness scholarship that translation has a rich potential for deciphering or confirming pragmatic aspects of the phenomenon, which are elsewhere pursued through monolingual research.

TI Dynamic secretion during meiotic reentry integrates the function of the
   oocyte and cumulus cells
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB The differentiation of the female gamete into a developmentally competent oocyte relies on the protected environment of the ovarian follicle. The oocyte plays a key role in establishing this microenvironment by releasing paracrine factors that control the functions of surrounding somatic cells. Growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9) and bone morphogenetic protein 15 (BMP15) are secreted during follicle growth and play pivotal roles in this local regulation. The current view is that the function of these secreted factors declines in the periovulatory period when the oocyte reenters the meiotic cell cycle. Here, we provide evidence that oocyte reentry into meiosis is instead associated with a shift in the pattern of secretion with a new set of bioactive molecules synthesized before ovulation. Using interleukin 7 (IL7) as a prototypic secreted factor, we show that its secretion is dependent on activation of mRNA translation in synchrony with the cell cycle and that its translation is under the control of somatic cells. IL7 is part of a local feedback loop with the soma because it regulates cumulus cell replication. Similar conclusions are reached when IL7 secretion is measured in human follicular fluid during in vitro fertilization cycles. IL7 concentration in the follicular fluid correlates with the oocyte ability to reach the MII stage of maturation. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that a new set of local factors is secreted by the oocyte during ovulation. These dynamic secretions are likely critical for promoting the final stages of maturation and oocyte developmental competence.

TI WHAT THE HELL IS UNDER THE STAGE? TRAPDOOR USE IN THE ENGLISH SENECAN

SO ENGLISH
AB This paper looks at the staging conventions of the trapdoor in the Senecanstyled tragedy of the Elizabethan period. It looks at the development of trapdoor use in the tragedies of the Inns of Court plays of the 1560s and 1570s, and at the slightly earlier University translations and productions of Seneca to establish a frame of reference for the representation of Hell, the underworld, and everything else that lurks beneath the trapdoor of the Elizabethan playhouse. Having established a set of classical underworld referents in the use of the trapdoor in the tradition established in the earlier scholarly settings of the Universities and Inns of Court, the paper concludes by looking at the implications of these conventions for the use of the trapdoor in two of Shakespeare's tragedies: Titus Andronicus and Hamlet.

TI The Role of Dynamic miRISC During Neuronal Development
SO FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR BIOSCIENCES
AB Activity-dependent protein synthesis plays an important role during neuronal development by fine-tuning the formation and function of neuronal circuits. Recent studies have shown that miRNAs are integral to this regulation because of their ability to control protein synthesis in a rapid, specific and potentially reversible manner. miRNA mediated regulation is a multistep process that involves inhibition of translation before degradation of targeted mRNA, which provides the possibility to store and reverse the inhibition at multiple stages. This flexibility is primarily thought to be derived from the composition of miRNA induced silencing complex (miRISC). AGO2 is likely the only obligatory component of miRISC, while multiple RBPs are shown to be associated with this core miRISC to form diverse miRISC complexes. The formation of these heterogeneous miRISC complexes is intricately regulated by various extracellular signals and cell-specific contexts. In this review, we discuss the composition of miRISC and its functions during neuronal development. Neurodevelopment is guided by both internal programs and external cues. Neuronal activity and external signals play an important role in the formation and refining of the neuronal network. miRISC composition and diversity have a critical role at distinct stages of neurodevelopment. Even though there is a good amount of literature available on the role of miRNAs mediated regulation of neuronal development, surprisingly the role of miRISC composition and its functional dynamics in neuronal development is not much discussed. In this article, we review the available literature on the heterogeneity of the neuronal miRISC composition and how this may influence translation regulation in the context of neuronal development.

TI Performing Shakespeare's Words: Textual Authority in Light of the Theory

SO MULTICULTURAL SHAKESPEARE-TRANSLATION APPROPRIATION AND PERFORMANCE
AB On the basis of Roman Ingarden's conceptions of indeterminacy and concretization and the notion of spoken action, Jacek Mydla constructs the idea of textual authority in Shakespeare's drama. The text is regarded as the primary source of meaning which determines theatrical representation. When reading a play actively, the reader fills out areas of indeterminacy in an attempt to build a faithful imaginary representation of the action. The thus reconstructed social mimesis can then be transferred onto the stage. Mydla argues for the precedence of textual over theatrical concretizations of Shakespeare.

TI Notchless defines a stage-specific requirement for ribosome biogenesis
   during lineage progression in adult skeletal myogenesis
SO DEVELOPMENT
AB Cell fate decisions occur through the action of multiple factors, including signalling molecules and transcription factors. Recently, the regulation of translation has emerged as an important step for modulating cellular function and fate, as exemplified by ribosomes that play distinct roles in regulating cell behaviour. Notchless (Nle) is a conserved nuclear protein that is involved in a crucial step in ribosome biogenesis, and is required for the maintenance of adult haematopoietic and intestinal stem/progenitor cells. Here, we show that activated skeletal muscle satellite cells in conditional Nle mutant mice are arrested in proliferation; however, deletion of Nle in myofibres does not impair myogenesis. Furthermore, conditional deletion of Nle in satellite cells during homeostasis did not impact on their fate for up to 3 months. In contrast, loss of Nle function in primary myogenic cells blocked proliferation because of major defects in ribosome formation. Taken together, we show that muscle stem cells undergo a stage-specific regulation of ribosome biogenesis, thereby underscoring the importance of differential modulation of mRNA translation for controlling cell fate decisions.

TI Re-canonizing the Shanhaijing in the world (literature): the myth, the
   play and the comic book
SO ASIA PACIFIC TRANSLATION AND INTERCULTURAL STUDIES
AB In 1989, Gao Xingjian - a Chinese-born artist (1940), French citizen (1997) and Nobel Prize for Literature (2000) - gave birth to the Shanhaijing zhuan mountain (Of Mountains and Seas), a tragicomedy in three acts. As the title evokes, the lyrical drama is inspired to the ancient mythology of the Shanhaijing mountain(The Classic of Mountains and Seas), an encyclopaedic cosmography compiled from the Warring States period to the Western Han dynasty (4(th)-1(st) century BC). By creating this play, the Nobel Laureate re-codified a Chinese canonical work into a contemporary play. After that, an American comic book based on Gao tragicomedy appeared, Guideways through Mountains and Seas. Based on the assumption that the three works are genealogically related, the paper describes the changes taking place through the process of transposition, by focusing on the macro- and micro-textual profiles. Thus, it re-discusses the canon and the dynamics canonicity, by revealing how translation and intertextuality both ensue from the canonization of literature (and world literature) and empower its circulation and consecration beyond frontiers.

TI Robust Head Detection in Complex Videos Using Two-Stage Deep Convolution
   Framework
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Pedestrian head detection plays an important role in identifying and localizing individuals in real world visual data. Head detection is a nontrivial problem due to considerable variance in camera view-points, scales, human poses, and appearances in the scene. Thanks to the translation invariance property of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which enables large capacity CNNs to handle the problem of appearance and pose variations in the scene. However, the problem of scale invariance is still an open issue. To address this problem, this paper presents a two-stage head detection framework that utilizes fully convolutional network (FCN) to generate scale-aware proposals followed by CNN that classifies each proposal into two classes, i.e. head and background. Experiments results show that using scale-aware proposals obtained by FCN, the object recall rate and mean average precision (mAP) are improved. Additionaly, we demonstrate that our framework achieved state-of-the-art results on four challenging benchmark datasets, i.e. HollywoodHeads, Casablanca, SHOCK, and WIDERFACE.

TI 'A FIT MEMORIAL FOR THE TIMES TO COME ... ': ADMONITION AND TOPICAL
   APPLICATION IN MARY SIDNEY'S ANTONIUS AND SAMUEL DANIEL'S CLEOPATRA
SO REVIEW OF ENGLISH STUDIES
AB Whether designed for the closet, the academic stage, or the public theatres, virtually all late Elizabethan plays about ancient Rome dealt, in one way or another, with the collapse of the republic. Yet that does not mean that they were 'republican', as some recent critics have argued. Rather, the playwrights summoned the Roman past to address, however obliquely, many of the ethical and constitutional issues driving debates about the succession and international politics-and, by default, religion. The following is a case study of two 1590s closet dramas, Mary Sidney's Antonius ( 1592), a translation from the French of Robert Garnier, and Samuel Daniel's companion piece Cleopatra ( 1594). Emulating the uses of classical history by Protestant polemicists, divines, and imaginative writers, the two invoke parallels between ancient Rome and Philip II's Spain, Egypt and Elizabethan England, in a bid to underscore the twin dangers of an unsettled succession and royal indolence. At the same time, they exploit the rhetoric of anti-absolutism and anti-imperialism as a vehicle for anti-Spanish sentiment. Far from questioning monarchy per se, Sidney and Daniel denounce Hapsburg designs for global sovereignty and implicitly critique Elizabeth's queenship, suggesting, by contrast, what the godly ruler should be.

TI eIF4E-Dependent Translational Control: A Central Mechanism for
   Regulation of Pain Plasticity
SO FRONTIERS IN GENETICS
AB Translational control of gene expression has emerged as a key mechanism in regulating different forms of long-lasting neuronal plasticity. Maladaptive plastic reorganization of peripheral and spinal nociceptive circuits underlies many chronic pain states and relies on new gene expression. Accordingly, downregulation of mRNA translation in primary afferents and spinal dorsal horn neurons inhibits tissue injury-induced sensitization of nociceptive pathways, supporting a central role for translation dysregulation in the development of persistent pain. Translation is primarily regulated at the initiation stage via the coordinated activity of translation initiation factors. The mRNA cap-binding protein, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), is involved in the recruitment of the ribosome to the mRNA cap structure, playing a central role in the regulation of translation initiation. eIF4E integrates inputs from the mTOR and ERK signaling pathways, both of which are activated in numerous painful conditions to regulate the translation of a subset of mRNAs. Many of these mRNAs are involved in the control of cell growth, proliferation, and neuroplasticity. However, the full repertoire of eIF4E-dependent mRNAs in the nervous system and their translation regulatory mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this review, we summarize the current evidence for the role of eIF4E-dependent translational control in the sensitization of pain circuits and present pharmacological approaches to target these mechanisms. Understanding eIF4E-dependent translational control mechanisms and their roles in aberrant plasticity of nociceptive circuits might reveal novel therapeutic targets to treat persistent pain states.

TI The initial stage of Russian-Chinese cultural interactions
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
AB The article focuses on the role of cultural exchanges between Russia and China in the 19th century and highlights the following aspects of Russian-Chinese cultural interactions at the initial stage: the first trips of Chinese diplomats abroad, the role of the Orthodox mission in spreading knowledge about China in Russia, literature exchange, the contribution of Russian writers to popularizing Chinese culture and of Chinese writers and revolutionaries to popularizing Russian literature. The author came to the following conclusions. The Chinese diplomatic mission in Russia in the 19th century was not numerous (Bin Chun, Li Hongzhan and some others); visits of official delegations were not frequent either, which had some implications for the negligible outcome of long-term interactions and cultural exchanges. Another opportunity to get acquainted with China and Chinese culture was provided by the establishment of the Russian Orthodox Mission, which played an important role in spreading knowledge about China in Russia, as well as in the birth of Russian Chinese studies and the formation of a pleiad of Orientalists (Bichurin, Vasilyev). Chinese literature in Russia was in demand among not only scholars, but also writers, who contributed greatly to the dissemination of Chinese culture. Russian literature developed an interest in Chinese culture and classical literature, which was reflected in the works of Pushkin and Tolstoy. "Chinese motifs" are heard in Ruslan and Lyudmila, Eugene Onegin, and "To a Friend". Pushkin also researched and edited expedition reports and letters about China. He was a friend of Bichurin and positively evaluated his translation of San Zi Jing (Rus. Troeslovie; En. The Three Character Classic). Tolstoy seriously studied Confucianism and Taoism and was directly involved in the translation of the Tao Te Ching from French and German. China also gradually began to become familiar with Russian literature. Tolstoy' s works had the greatest influence - they were very common in China at the beginning of the twentieth century. Many young people of the time - first of all, revolutionaries and writers, the first leaders of the Communist Party of China (Chen Duxiu, Li Dazhao, Lu Xun and Hu Shih, Mao Dun, Ba Jin, etc.) - liked Tolstoy's works. The worldview of Tolstoy the thinker and the humanistic spirit of his works became an important spiritual nourishment for the development of modern Chinese literature; together with translations of his texts, Russian cultural and philosophical views entered the Chinese spiritual space. Further processes of interaction and exchanges between the two countries took place in various directions, became a link for modern international cooperation and the desire for common development at the beginning of the 21st century.

SO ERUDITION AND THE REPUBLIC OF LETTERS
AB In 1591, Henry Savile completed his celebrated translation of Tacitus, dedicating his efforts to the queen. Remarkably, the printer's copy of Savile's translation has survived, now preserved at the Bodleian Library, Oxford (Bodl. ms Eng. hist. d. 240). Replete with handwritten notes by both Henry Savile and his younger brother, Thomas, the manuscript offers a fascinating insight into the final stages of the translation. From instructions for the printer to last-minute changes to the text, the manuscript shines new light on print culture in the final years of the sixteenth century. This article establishes the manuscript's provenance, tracing its journey from Savile's study to Methley Manor, Yorkshire, and finally to the Bodleian Library. It also considers the evidence provided by the manuscript of collaboration between Henry and Thomas Savile as they undertook this extraordinary translation-cum-commentary. Finally, by comparing the text of the translation as it appears in the printer's copy with that of the published version, the article explores what this manuscript reveals about Savile's methods of, and approach to, translation.

TI Archive, Repertory, Supplement: Thinking Theatre through Intersections
SO NEW THEATRE QUARTERLY
AB This article discusses the relationship between drama and performance, using the Derridean concept of 'supplement' in theatre, which exceeds polarities and attempts a more dialectic approach. A review of Marvin Carlson's theories of illustration, separation, translation, and fulfilment is a starting point for a comprehensive analysis of the views that encourage the binary drama-performance. This is examined in combination with Diane Taylor's distinction between the 'archive', which preserves and bears all the written culture, and the 'repertory', which contains the world of performance. The 'supplement' holds two meanings: as a supplement, an externaladdition-to, and as a complement, asupplement-of, that comes in to fill a gap. One example is used to present the relationship between archive, repertory, and supplement: Brecht'sThe Downfall of the Egotist Johann Fatzer.Theatre can be thought of in formations ofheteropoieticsequence, through chains of supplements, including the texts, the performances, the rehearsal devices, the publication context, and the director's notebooks.

AB The genomes of Leishmania and trypanosomes encode six paralogs of the eIF4E cap-binding protein, known in other eukaryotes to anchor the translation initiation complex. In line with the heteroxenous nature of these parasites, the different LeishIF4E paralogs vary in their biophysical features and their biological behavior. We therefore hypothesize that each has a specialized function, not limited to protein synthesis. Of the six paralogs, LeishIF4E-3 has a weak cap-binding activity. It participates in the assembly of granules that store inactive transcripts and ribosomal proteins during nutritional stress that is experienced in the sand fly. We investigated the role of LeishIF4E-3 in Leishmania mexicana promastigotes using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. We deleted one of the two LeishIF4E-3 alleles, generating a heterologous deletion mutant with reduced LeishIF4E-3 expression. The mutant showed a decline in de novo protein synthesis and growth kinetics, altered morphology, and impaired infectivity. The mutant cells were rounded and failed to transform into the nectomonad-like form, in response to purine starvation. Furthermore, the infectivity of macrophage cells by the LeishIF4E-3(+/-) mutant was severely reduced. These phenotypic features were not observed in the addback cells, in which expression of LeishIF4E-3 was restored. The observed phenotypic changes correlated with the profile of transcripts associated with LeishIF4E-3. These were enriched for cytoskeleton- and flagellum-encoding genes, along with genes for RNA binding proteins. Our data illustrate the importance of LeishIF4E-3 in translation and in the parasite virulence.
   IMPORTANCE Leishmania species are the causative agents of a spectrum of diseases. Available drug treatment is toxic and expensive, with drug resistance a growing concern. Leishmania parasites migrate between transmitting sand flies and mammalian hosts, experiencing unfavorable extreme conditions. The parasites therefore developed unique mechanisms for promoting a stage-specific program for gene expression, with translation playing a central role. There are six paralogs of the cap-binding protein eIF4E, which vary in their function, expression profiles, and assemblages. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 system for Leishmania, we deleted one of the two LeishIF4E-3 alleles. Expression of LeishIF4E-3 in the deletion mutant was low, leading to reduction in global translation and growth of the mutant cells. Cell morphology also changed, affecting flagellum growth, cell shape, and infectivity. The importance of this study is in highlighting that LeishIF4E-3 is essential for completion of the parasite life cycle. Our study gives new insight into how parasite virulence is determined.

TI Clinical and Biological Interpretation of Survival Curves of Cancer
   Patients, Exemplified With Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancers With
   Long Follow-up
SO FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
AB Worldwide, 18.1 million new invasive cancers and 9.9 million cancer deaths occurred in 2020. Lung cancer is the second most frequent (11.4%) and, with 1.8 million deaths, remains the leading cause of cancer mortality. About 1.7 million of lung cancers are of the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) subtype, and of these, 60%-70% are in advanced stage IV at the time of diagnosis. Thus, the annual worldwide number of new NSCLC stage IV patients is about 1 million, and they have a very poor prognosis. Indeed, 25%-30% die within 3 months of diagnosis. However, the survival duration of the remaining 700,000 new patients per year surviving > 3 months varies enormously. Surprisingly, little research has been done to explain these survival differences, but recently it was found that classical patient, tumour and treatment features cannot accurately distinguish short- and very long-term survivors. What then are the causes of these bewildering survival variations amongst "the same cancers "? Clonality, proliferation differences, neovascularization, intra-tumour heterogeneity, genetic inhomogeneity and other cancer hallmarks play important roles. Considering each of these, single or combined, can greatly improve our understanding. Another technique is analysis of the survival curve of a seemingly homogeneous group of cancer patients. This can give valuable information about the existence of subgroups and their biological characteristics. Different basic survival curves and what their shapes tell about the biological properties of these invasive cancers are discussed. Application of this analysis technique to the survival curve of 690 stage IV NSCLC patients with a 3.2-120.0-month survival suggests that this seemingly homogeneously group of patients probably consists of 4-8 subgroups with a very different survival. A subsequent detailed mathematical analysis shows that a model of 8 subgroups gives a very good match with the original survival curve of the whole group. In conclusion, the survival curve of a seemingly homogeneous group of cancer patients can give valuable information about the existence of subgroups and their biological characteristics. Application of this technique to 690 NSCLC Stage IV patients makes it probable that 8 different subgroups with very different survival rates exist in this group of cancers.

TI Transcriptional Stages of Conidia Germination and Associated Genes in
   Aspergillus flavus: An Essential Role for Redox Genes
SO TOXINS
AB Aflatoxin is a threatening mycotoxin primarily present in the agricultural environment, especially in food and feedstuff, and poses significant global health risks. Aflatoxins are produced mainly by Aspergillus flavus. Conidia germination is the first step for A. flavus development. In this study, the transcriptome of A. flavus conidia was analyzed at three different stages of conidia germination, which were characterized by two different microscopes. Dormant conidia grew isotropically with the cell size increasing up to 5 h of after being inoculated in a liquid medium. Conidia changed towards polarized growth from 5 to 10 h of germination, during which germ tubes formed. Moreover, transcriptome analyses revealed that a larger number of genes changed in the isotropic growth stages compared to polarized growth, with 1910 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) up-regulated and 969 DEGs down-regulated in isotropic growth. GO and KEGG pathway analyses and pathway enrichment demonstrated that, in the isotropic growth stage, the top three pathways were translation, amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism. The ribosome was a key pathway in translation, as RPS28e, RPL53 and RPL36e were the top three DEGs. For polarized growth stage, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism were the top three most active pathways. POX1 from alpha-linolenic acid metabolism was a DEG in lipid metabolism as well. Genes related to the antioxidant system were crucial for conidia germination. Furthermore, RT-PCR results showed the same trends as the transcriptome for redox genes, and essential oils have a significant inhibitory effect on germination rate and redox gene expression. Therefore, redox genes play an important role during germination, and the disruption of redox genes is involved in the mechanism of action of coumalic acid and geraniol against A. flavus spore germination.

TI THE PROBLEM OF TEXT COHERENCE IN THE OLD POLISH TRANSLATION OF RACINE'S
   "ANDROMAQUE" BY STANISLAW MORSZTYN
SO PAMIETNIK LITERACKI
AB Andromaque by Stanislaw Morsztyn is the first Polish translation of the tragedy by Jean Racine, which dates back to the 1690s. The study describes a clash of two artistic strategies present in the text: the first strategy aims at highlighting the whole tragedy outlined by the translator while the second one emphasizes smaller text units. The first part of the article concerns Morsztyn's application of intertextual strategies. The translator aptly interprets Racine's references to ancient literature and adds some of his own (he quotes, for example, verses 63-64 from the second Heroid by Ovid - omitted by the author in his rendering of this fragment in verses 455-462). Within the scope of Polish literature, he introduces references to the works of Jan Kochanowski (Songs, I 17) and Lukasz Gornicki (Troas, II 281-282, 515-516) among many others. Moreover, Morsztyn imparts a dramatic sense to intertextual references, which is in accordance with the strategy employed in the original text. The second part of the text is devoted to the translator's use of rhetorical devices. One may note here the reinforcement of a logical and ethical dimension of the character's dialogues, which sometimes takes place at the cost of pathetic dimension (omission of syntactic disorders as a marker of strong emotions). The last part addresses the problem of dramatic insertion of oratorical and lyrical passages, such as tirades and monologues. A slight tendency to emphasize the autonomy of declamatory parts is noticeable - at the cost of organic unity of the drama. In the whole of the translation, one may identify moments of the translator's weakening control over tragedy structure looked at as a whole. However, this can be regarded as internally conditioned by the literary system of classicism.

   climbing to performance
SO PERFORMANCE RESEARCH
AB This article traces the developments of Black Rock, an immersive multimedia performance inspired by Johnny Dawes infamous 1986 first absent of Indian Face (E9 6c). Black Rock, developed as part of Performing Mountains an AHRC research project led by Jonathan Pitches, aimed to question: to what extent can the experience of mountain climbing be translated to an audience on the ground? In order to unpack this complex embodied pursuit, I present my findings through five routes; Personal Mountains, The Gesture of a Line Language and Movement, Crafting Atmosphere and Breath. The routes present a holistic approach to practice research that combine first hand site-based research, historical research, performance theory, collaborator and audience insights and my own reflective insights as the lead artist. I conclude by exploring how the act of scenographic translation can be seen as a supplement to the original source material.

TI High-Expression of Cytoplasmic Poly (A) Binding Protein 1 (PABPC1) as a
   Prognostic Biomarker for Early-Stage Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
SO CANCER MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH
AB Background and Objective: Poly (A) binding protein cytoplasmic 1 (PABPC1) plays a crucial role in the regulation of RNA polyadenylation, translation initiation, and mRNA stability and may be involved in tumorigenesis. Herein, we set out to identify the prognostic value of PABPC1 expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).
   Methods: Using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemical analysis, the present study investigated mRNA and protein expressions of PABPC1 in 231 ESCCs and their paired adjacent normal epithelial tissues.
   Results: We observed a reduction in the average mRNA expression of PABPC1 in ESCC tissue specimen, but the mRNA expression of PABPC1 was significantly higher (P<0.001) in ESCC tissues with high PABPC1 expression and lower (P=0.033) in tissues with low PABPC1 expression. In immunohistochemical analysis, positive expression of the PABPC1 protein was identified in 179 ESCC tissue specimens (179/231, 77.5%), while the percentage of ESCC tissue specimens with high expression of PABPC1 was found to be 41.1% (95/231). PABPC1 expression was found to be significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis (LNM) (P=0.011), pathological stage (P=0.021), tumor recurrence (P<0.001), and the outcome (P<0.001) of patients with ESCC. High expression of PABPC1 was associated with poor overall survival (OS) of ESCC patients (P<0.001) among all pathological stages, particularly in the early stages (pStage-I and -II), and identified to be an independent prognostic factor for OS of patients with ESCC in multivariate analysis (HR=2.622; 95% CI, 1.68-4.129). Comparatively, the expression of Ki-67, p53, and nm23 was not associated with OS.
   Conclusion: In this study, we discovered that PABPC1 is a prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target for ESCC, particularly early-stage ESCC.

TI The triumph of the silver screen: Christiaan Obragen's film adaptation
   of The Seagull
SO TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE
AB This article analyses selected aspects of director Christiaan Olwagen 's critically acclaimed 2018 film adaptation of the Russian playwright Anton Checkhov:s play The Seagull (original title: Chayka). In Olwagen 's Die sceineeu, the action is set in South Africa in the early 1990s, the time of transition to a democratic South Africa. For the Afrikaans world of the arts, this was a time of upheaval: the existing national arts boards were dismantled and Afrikaans actors and directors lost their state funding and support. Afrikaans theatre adapted to this different context by moving to smaller, independent theatres and especially the new national arts festivals, for example the Klein Karoo National Arts Festival (KKNK) that originated in 1995. Olwagen's film spans four years and depicts this change as it affects Irene (Irina Arkadina), afamous Afrikaans actress. By the end of the film, she has just starred in a successful production at the first KKNK.
   Firstly, the article provides a brief overview of translation theory and adaptation themy and the overlap between these fields. The terms "translation" and "adaptation" are defined. Reference is made to the scholars who concur that adaptation is a form of translation. The concept of 'fidelity criticism" is briefly explored as an approach that used to be followed frequently in adaptation studies; the degree to which an adaptation remains "faithful" to the original text was and is studied, in particular when canonical authors are the topic of the investigation. This approach is contrasted with the more recent view that the subjectivity of the adapter is one of the main important factors in an adaptation. In this approach, the adapter uses the adaptation as a vehicle for his own thematic and ideological preoccupations. Both of these approaches are relevant for Olwagen adaptation of The Seagull.
   In the next section, two scenes in Olwagen:s film are analysed: the production of the play written by Konstant (Konstantin Gravrilovich Treplew) at the beginning of the film, and the scene at the end where Nina sees Konstant again. In addition, the film poster and soundtrack are analysed. Konstants play in Olwagen 's film is a rewriting of Konstantin' s play in Chekhov 's The Seagull. This makes Olwagen:s interaction with Chekhov in his adaptation particularly dense and multi-layered. In Olwagen adaptation, the symbolism of the seagull is made very prominent bv giving Nina a pair of wings to wear that she thinks make her look like a seagull, and by adding the line "I am the seagull" at the end of the play. Moreover, the film poster depicts the head of a seagull on the body of a man holding a rifle. The content and tone of Konstant's play, in addition to the heavy-handed use of symbolism, suggest that the original subtlety of Chekhov: s play was not retained in Olwagen's adaptation. The soundtrack is equally unsubtle: a revue of well-known symphonic works bvfamous Russian composers. This choice, as well as the design of the film poster (which is reminiscent of Russian propaganda art), is evidence that Olwagen reverted to stereotypes of Russia while presenting a play by a Russian playwright to an Afrikaans audience; whether in a serious or playful manner, it is somewhat hard to ascertain.
   When one abandons the concept of faithfulness to the original, the above choices are perfectly in line with the subjectivity of the adapter when it comes to adaptation. Olwagen chose to emphasise the seagull symbolism and the "Russian-ness" of his (South Africanised) adaptation in order to make his film accessible to Afrikaans film viewers, and to find some way to harmonise the original context of the Chekhov play with the South African setting. His choices also highlight the tension between stage plays and films: in a time when far fewer consumers will attend an (Afrikaans) play, there is still a market for Afrikaans films, and this is the target audience for which his adaptation was created.
   Finally, Olwagen Die seemeeu is briefly compared to his other feature films, Johnny is Me dood rue (2017) and Kanarie (2018). These three films all demonstrate Olwagen's preoccupation with apartheid South Africa and the insularity of white Afrikaners in this period It is shown that certain aspects of the structure, as well as visual and stylistic choices were guided by the desire to create continuity between Die seemeeu and the other two films by Olwagen. He appears to be in the process of establishing himself as an auteur filmmaker.
   Olwagen adaptation of The Seagull is (among other things) a film about adaptation. After seeing Konstant's adaptation of Konstantin's play, Irene asks, "Why fuck up a classic?" The film confirms the theoretical view that the subjectivity of the adapter is all-important: Olwagen has attempted to integrate his condemnation of the ignorance and insularity of Afrikaners under apartheid with a digestible adaptation of a classic work that would please film audiences. He comments on the period of transition in which Afrikaans theatre had to reassess and adapt its practices, and also comments on the current dispensation in which the Afrikaans film industry is booming. In this context, his film represents the triumph of the silver screen where film adaptations are the most lucrative. It is not altogether clear, however, whether Olwagen escapes the insularity of which he is critical, since he restricts himself to themes that are largely limited to Afrikaners.

TI The Role of Misshapen NCK-related kinase (MINK), a Novel Ste20 Family
   Kinase, in the IRES-Mediated Protein Translation of Human Enterovirus 71
SO PLOS PATHOGENS
AB Human Enterovirus 71 (EV71) commonly causes Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease in young children, and occasional occurrences of neurological complications can be fatal. In this study, a high-throughput cell-based screening on the serine/threonine kinase siRNA library was performed to identify potential antiviral agents against EV71 replication. Among the hits, Misshapen/NIKs-related kinase (MINK) was selected for detailed analysis due to its strong inhibitory profile and novelty. In the investigation of the stage at which MINK is involved in EV71 replication, virus RNA transfection in MINK siRNA-treated cells continued to cause virus inhibition despite bypassing the normal entry pathway, suggesting its involvement at the post-entry stage. We have also shown that viral RNA and protein expression level was significantly reduced upon MINK silencing, suggesting its involvement in viral protein synthesis which feeds into viral RNA replication process. Through proteomic analysis and infection inhibition assay, we found that the activation of MINK was triggered by early replication events, instead of the binding and entry of the virus. Proteomic analysis on the activation profile of p38 Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) indicated that the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was stimulated by EV71 infection upon MINK activation. Luciferase reporter assay further revealed that the translation efficiency of the EV71 internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) was reduced after blocking the MINK/p38 MAPK pathway. Further investigation on the effect of MINK silencing on heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) localisation demonstrated that cytoplasmic relocalisation of hnRNP A1 upon EV71 infection may be facilitated via the MINK/p38 MAPK pathway which then positively regulates the translation of viral RNA transcripts. These novel findings hence suggest that MINK plays a functional role in the IRES-mediated translation of EV71 viral RNA and may provide a potential target for the development of specific antiviral strategies against EV71 infection.

TI Afterword: Greek texts and the early modern stage
SO CLASSICAL RECEPTIONS JOURNAL
AB This article constitutes a response to this special issue of Classical Receptions Journal and especially to its introduction, which makes a strong case for the importance of Greek texts in the Early Modern period. It accepts the proposition that there was a revival, promoted by Erasmus, of scholarly interest in Greek imaginative literature, in the original, in Latin translation, and in various vernaculars. But it also asks how much real difference Greek made to writing in English and whether Early Modern writers offer powerfully dialogic receptions of Greek authors, in the way they clearly do of Latin authors, arguing thatmuchmore scholarly and critical work is needed to determine this issue. The importance of various forms ofmediation, often indirect, in the processes of reception is stressed. Thus it can be claimed that Shakespeare s Roman plays, based on Plutarch, constitute the age s most compelling reception of Greek literature, at least until Milton; but of course Shakespeare was using, not the original, but an English translation from the French. A consolidated study of the role of Greek in the literature and culture of the English Renaissance, without special pleading, remains a key desideratum.

TI Proto-oncogenes in a eukaryotic unicellular organism play essential
   roles in plasmodial growth in host cells
SO BMC GENOMICS
AB BackgroundThe eukaryotic unicellular protist Plasmodiophora brassicae is an endocellular parasite of cruciferous plants. In host cortical cells, this protist develops a unicellular structure that is termed the plasmodium. The plasmodium is actually a multinucleated cell, which subsequently splits and forms resting spores. The mechanism for the growth of this endocellular parasite in host cell is unclear.ResultsHere, combining de novo genome sequence and transcriptome analysis of strain ZJ-1, we identified top five significant enriched KEGG pathways of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), namely translation, cell growth and death, cell communication, cell motility and cancers. We detected 171 proto-oncogenes from the genome of P. brassicae that were implicated in cancer-related pathways, of which 46 were differential expression genes. Three predicted proto-oncogenes (Pb-Raf1, Pb-Raf2, and Pb-MYB), which showed homology to the human proto-oncogenes Raf and MYB, were specifically activated during the plasmodial growth in host cortical cells, demonstrating their involvement in the multinucleate development stage of the unicellular protist organism. Gene networks involved in the tumorigenic-related signaling transduction pathways and the activation of 12 core genes were identified. Inhibition of phosphoinositol-3-kinase relieved the clubroot symptom and significantly suppressed the development process of plasmodia.ConclusionsProto-oncogene-related regulatory mechanisms play an important role in the plasmodial growth of P. brassicae.

TI Androgyny as Mental Revolution in Act 4 of Prometheus Unbound
SO KEATS-SHELLEY REVIEW
AB Apart from in his translation of Plato's Symposium as The Banquet, the word 'androgyny' does not appear within Shelley's writings, but androgynous images are extant throughout his works. The androgynous union of Asia and Prometheus, the ungendering of Demogorgon, and the Earth and the Moon's shifting gendered pronouns in Act 4 echo Shelley's desire for 'a future state of being' wherein 'these detestable distinctions [of male and female] will surely be abolished'. The Banquet is a catalyst for the lyrical drama's composition, wherein androgyny becomes Shelley's central strategy for inciting mental revolution in his audience of ideal readers. Shelley assumes the self-ordained role of Plato's ideal reader through his creative translation of The Banquet, where the mental union of writer and translator radically expands androgyny as the traditional union of the masculine and the feminine to include the psychic union of the poet and the reader. Drawing upon the dialogic, dramatic form of Plato's text, his subtle instruction of his reader, and his playfulness with gender, Shelley transmutes elements of The Banquet into verse in Prometheus Unbound in order to encourage a mental revolution in his own readership.

TI METTL3 promotes ovarian carcinoma growth and invasion through the
   regulation of AXL translation and epithelial to mesenchymal transition
SO GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
AB Objective. As the most prevalent internal modification in mammalian messenger RNA, N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) plays an important role in posttranscriptional gene regulation. METTL3 is a key component of the m6A methyltransferase complex and has recently been shown to play important roles in cancer development and progression. The current study was aimed to explore the function and underlying mechanism of METTL3 in ovarian cancer.
   Methods. METTL3 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry in 162 ovarian carcinoma patients. Stable cell lines with METTL3 gene overexpression or knockdown were established to investigate the function of METTL3 in ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo.
   Results. METTL3 was frequently upregulated in ovarian carcinoma and that a high level of METTL3 was significantly associated with tumor grade (P = 0.001), pT status (P = 0.002), pN/pM status (P < 0.001), FIGO stage (P < 0.001), and overall survival rate (P < 0.001). Stable overexpression of METTL3 in the OVCAR3 and COV504 cell lines significantly increased cellular proliferation, focus formation, motility, invasion, and tumor formation in nude mice. Silencing METTL3 expression in the SKOV3 and HO-8910 cell lines with short hairpin RNA effectively inhibited its oncogenic function. Further study found that METTL3 promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by upregulating the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL.
   Conclusion. Our findings suggest that METTL3 plays very important oncogenic roles in ovarian carcinoma development and/or aggressiveness by stimulating AXL translation and EMT and that METTL3 may serve as a novel prognostic and/or therapeutic target of interest in ovarian cancer.

TI 'Don't You Dare to Vote With the Communists!': Timeliness, Nostalgia,
   and the Authenticity of Experience in I'm a Communist Biddy!
SO ADAPTATION-THE JOURNAL OF LITERATURE ON SCREEN STUDIES
AB This article investigates the parallel adaptation processes between genres and media of Dan Lungu's celebrated Romanian novel I'm a Communist Biddy! (2007). Drawing on Stere Gulea's film adaptation (Sunt a baba comunistal, MediaPro Pictures, Romania, 2013) and Tamara T r k and Judit Csoma's stage version (Egy komcsi nyanya vagyok!, Katona J zsef Theatre, Budapest, 2013), the article observes that neither film nor play are governed by an agenda of fidelity to the source text, and they depart from the literary source because of a new historical and economic context, in which the preoccupation with the communist era remains a timely endeavour all the same. Both versions strive for authenticity in terms of location and time period, and to this end they opt for an elaborate recreation of the past in the film and a reduction to literal levels of austerity onstage. Thus, both cinematic and stage adaptation operate as explorations into the protagonist's past, and in this sense they are illuminating works of art about personal memory, embedded to a certain extent, within collective memory. The adaptations strive to accurately represent selected notions of history, in parallel with which they also create alternative temporalities that mythologize history and favour a nonlinear sense of time. For this reason, I read these adaptations-ranging from transposition to commentary-as a form of translation, that explores the relationship between women and history and intertwines a cluster of influences, from historical plays and films, memory and verbatim plays, as well as staged biographies and enactments ` on location'.

   IV AND 2 HENRY VI IN SLOVENE
SO ANNALES-ANALI ZA ISTRSKE IN MEDITERANSKE STUDIJE-SERIES HISTORIA ET
   SOCIOLOGIA
AB William Shakespeare reflected the Elizabethan fascination with the intricate symbolism of heraldry in his poetry and drama. This paper examines Slovene translations of selected passages from 1 Henry IV and 2 Henry VI that involve heraldic language and pose conundrums even in the original. Because of a scarcity of available vocabulary in the target language, translator Matej Bor struggled to replicate heraldic allusions and puns; nevertheless, he successfully compensated for the lexical gap with other structures. The paper also proposes a new reading of a crucial heraldic allusion from 2 Henry VI.

TI Ythdc2 is an N-6-methyladenosine binding protein that regulates
   mammalian spermatogenesis
SO CELL RESEARCH
AB N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most common internal modification in eukaryotic mRNA. It is dynamically installed and removed, and acts as a new layer of mRNA metabolism, regulating biological processes including stem cell pluripotency, cell differentiation, and energy homeostasis. m(6)A is recognized by selective binding proteins; YTHDF1 and YTHDF3 work in concert to affect the translation of m(6)A-containing mRNAs, YTHDF2 expedites mRNA decay, and YTHDC1 affects the nuclear processing of its targets. The biological function of YTHDC2, the final member of the YTH protein family, remains unknown. We report that YTHDC2 selectively binds m(6)A at its consensus motif. YTHDC2 enhances the translation efficiency of its targets and also decreases their mRNA abundance. Ythdc2 knockout mice are infertile; males have significantly smaller testes and females have significantly smaller ovaries compared to those of littermates. The germ cells of Ythdc2 knockout mice do not develop past the zygotene stage and accordingly, Ythdc2 is upregulated in the testes as meiosis begins. Thus, YTHDC2 is an m(6)A-binding protein that plays critical roles during spermatogenesis.

TI Knowledge translation for nursing care for patients with Risk of
   perioperative positioning injury: A case report
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING KNOWLEDGE
AB Purpose The aim was to apply the Advanced Nursing Process and demonstrating procedures of surgical positioning, as well as to show the participating the Nursing Outcomes Classification findings in order to translate the knowledge on specific preventive perioperative positioning into practice, the review of clinical protocols and nursing care plan. Methods The methods used include case report about knowledge translation by applying training modalities, review and adaptation of clinical protocols and examination of nursing care plans. Findings One hundred and nine healthcare providers attended the training, including nurses and nursing technicians working in the surgical center and the outpatient surgical center of the hospital chosen for this study. The surgical positioning protocols were revised based on the evidence described in the literature and the main surgical guidelines. The review of care registered in the institution's electronic system for the nursing prescription stage of the diagnosis Risk of perioperative positioning injury was based on the review on evidence on risk factors, the main guidelines in the area and the interventions suggested by Nursing Intervention Classification. The electronic system had registered 14 cares for this diagnosis, and after the review, one care was excluded and eight new cares were included, totaling 21 cares. Conclusion Nursing teams play a prominent role in positioning patients for surgery, protecting them in a moment of extreme vulnerability, thus making knowledge about the fundamental elements of surgical positioning essential. This emphasizes the importance of training, and of reviewing protocols and records of procedures that promote safety to patients and care teams. Implication for nursing practice The translation of knowledge about the Advanced Nursing Process in the perioperative area contributes to the refinement of classifications and standardization of language in this scenario, subsidizing an evidence-based clinical practice.

TI Molecular Characterization and Phylogenetic Analysis of the Eukaryotic
   Translation Initiation Factor 4A Gene in Antheraea pernyi (Lipdoptera:
   Saturniidae)
SO JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE
AB Eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF-4A) is an essential component for protein translation in eukaryotes. The eIF-4A gene (ApeIF-4A) was isolated and characterized from Antheraea pernyi (Guerin-Meneville) (Lepidoptera: Saturniidae). The obtained cDNA sequence was 1,435-bp long with an open reading frame of 1,266 bp encoding 421 amino acids. The predicted amino acid sequence shared several conserved features as found in known eIF-4As and revealed 74 and 78% identities with eIF-4As of Homo sapiens L. and Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen), respectively. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that ApeIF-4A was transcribed at four developmental stages and in all tissues tested, suggesting that it plays an important role in development of A. pernyi. Homologous alignment suggested that eIF-4As are highly conserved throughout evolution of eukaryote organisms. Phylogenetic trees based on the amino acid and nucleotide sequences of eIF-4A demonstrated a similar topology with the classical systematics, suggesting that it has the potential value in phylogenetic inference of eukaryotes.

TI Genomics and metabolomics of early-stage thioacetamide-induced liver
   injury: An interspecies study between guinea pig and rat
SO TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY
AB To study the complex processes involved in liver injuries, researchers rely on animal investigations, using chemically or surgically induced liver injuries, to extrapolate findings and infer human health risks. However, this presents obvious challenges in performing a detailed comparison and validation between the highly controlled animal models and development of liver injuries in humans. Furthermore, it is not clear whether there are species-dependent and-independent molecular initiating events or processes that cause liver injury before they eventually lead to end-stage liver disease. Here, we present a side-by-side study of rats and guinea pigs using thioacetamide to examine the similarities between early molecular initiating events during an acute-phase liver injury. We exposed Sprague Dawley rats and Hartley guinea pigs to a single dose of 25 or 100 mg/kg thioacetamide and collected blood plasma for metabolomic analysis and liver tissue for RNA-sequencing. The subsequent toxicogenomic analysis identified consistent liver injury trends in both genomic and metabolomic data within 24 and 33 h after thioacetamide exposure in rats and guinea pigs, respectively. In particular, we found species similarities in the key injury phenotypes of inflammation and fibrogenesis in our gene module analysis for liver injury phenotypes. We identified expression of several common genes (e.g., SPP1, TNSF18, SERPINE1, CLDN4, TIMP1, CD44, and LGALS3), activation of injury-specific KEGG pathways, and alteration of plasma metabolites involved in amino acid and bile acid metabolism as some of the key molecular processes that changed early upon thioacetamide exposure and could play a major role in the initiation of acute liver injury.

TI Late-stage MC38 tumours recapitulate features of human colorectal cancer
   - implications for appropriate timepoint selection in preclinical
   studies
SO FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
AB Anti-tumour T cell responses play a crucial role in controlling the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC), making this disease a promising candidate for immunotherapy. However, responses to immune-targeted therapies are currently limited to subpopulations of patients and specific types of cancer. Clinical studies have therefore focussed on identifying biomarkers that predict immunotherapy responses and elucidating the immunological landscapes of different cancers. Meanwhile, our understanding of how preclinical tumour models resemble human disease has fallen behind, despite their crucial role in immune-targeted drug development. A deeper understanding of these models is therefore needed to improve the development of immunotherapies and the translation of findings made in these systems. MC38 colon adenocarcinoma is a widely used preclinical model, yet how it recapitulates human colorectal cancer remains poorly defined. This study investigated the tumour-T cell immune landscape of MC38 tumours using histology, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry. We demonstrate that early-stage tumours exhibit a nascent TME, lacking important immune-resistance mechanisms of clinical interest, while late-stage tumours exhibit a mature TME resembling human tumours, with desmoplasia, T cell exhaustion, and T cell exclusion. Consequently, these findings clarify appropriate timepoint selection in the MC38 model when investigating both immunotherapies and mechanisms that contribute to immunotherapy resistance. Overall, this study provides a valuable resource that will enable appropriate application of the MC38 model and expedite the development and clinical translation of new immunotherapies.

TI The Moor's Political Colour: Race and Othello in Poland
SO MULTICULTURAL SHAKESPEARE-TRANSLATION APPROPRIATION AND PERFORMANCE
AB This paper provides a brief outline of the reception history of Othello in Poland, focusing on the way the character of the Moor of Venice is constructed on the page, in the first-published nineteenth-century translation by Jozef Paszkowski, and on the stage, in two twentieth-century theatrical adaptations that provide contrasting images of Othello: 1981/1984 televised Othello, dir. Andrzej Chrzanowski and the 2011 production of African Tales Based on Shakespeare, in which Othello's part is played by Adam Ferency (dir. Krzysztof Warlikowski). The paper details the political and social contexts of each of these stage adaptations, as both of them employ brownface and blackface to visualise Othello's "political colour." The function of blackface and brownface is radically different in these two productions: in the 1981/1984 Othello brownface works to underline Othello's overall sense of alienation, while strengthening the existing stereotypes surrounding black as a skin colour, while the 2011 staging makes the use of blackface as an artificial trick of the actor's trade, potentially unmasking the constructedness of racial prejudices, while confronting the audience with their own pernicious racial stereotypes.

   Self-Efficacy among Patients Undergoing Hemodialysis in Vietnam
SO HEALTHCARE
AB Self-care and self-efficacy play an important role in predicting quality of life among patients undergoing hemodialysis, but there currently is a lack of an instrument in the Vietnamese language for assessing self-care and self-efficacy. This limits the ability of researchers to explore and determine the confidence patients have in their ability to perform relevant self-care activities. The purpose of this investigation was to assess the validity and reliability of the Strategies Used by People to Promote Health questionnaire-Vietnamese version. This cross-sectional study involved translation, validation, and cultural adaptation of the questionnaire into Vietnamese and a trial with 127 patients undergoing hemodialysis in Bach Mai Hospital (Hanoi, Vietnam). The questionnaire was translated by bilingual translators and validated by three experts. Internal consistency and confirmatory factor analysis were applied. This questionnaire demonstrated good content validity and a Cronbach's alpha of 0.95 for the total scale. Confirmatory factor analysis of the three-factor model showed moderate model fit (comparative fit index = 0.84, Tucker-Lewis coefficient = 0.82, root mean square error of approximation = 0.09). Overall, this questionnaire exhibited acceptable validity and reliability for measuring self-care and self-efficacy among patients undergoing hemodialysis.

TI Translating Politics
SO PHILOSOPHY AND RHETORIC
AB This article attends to the process of translating politics-both in the writings of Jacques Ranciere and in their reception. I argue that Ranciere's project seeks not just to change the meaning of politics in a given conceptual framework or language but to think politics in a different language or paradigm entirely. I stage a working through of three different "cases" of translating politics, as I look at three terms: "aisthesis," "politics," and "the political." I conclude by emphasizing "politicalness," a word that helps to capture Ranciere's dynamic, nonontological sense of the unpredictable disruption of the police order by politics. A certain project of translation plays a central role in the Rancierean thinking of politics. No master dictionary can assure or secure translation across languages and contexts, and no political ontology can undergird or safeguard the historical happening of politics.

   TRADUCTION-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTERPRETATION AND TRANSLATION
AB The American version of Empresses in the Palace can be seen as a representative example of Chinese-to-English subtitled ancient costume drama, and an effective source of study as to how Extralinguistic Culture-bound References (ECRs) (Pedersen, 2005, 2011) in the source-language subtitles can emphasize and embody the essence of ancient Chinese culture. Based on Pedersen's (2005, 2011) theory of the Transculturality level of ECRs and through statistical as well as textual analysis, this paper aims to conduct a descriptive study of extralinguistic culture-bound references (ECRs) in Empresses in the Palace and the Chinese-English subtitling strategies of the ECRs. It found that Monocultural ECRs account for a substantial proportion of the ECRs, with eight ECR domains covered, and that the Source Language (SL)-oriented Strategies as well as Substitution are the foremost translation strategies adopted for rendering Monocultural ECRs. Eventually, based on textual analysis of the Monocultural ECRs rendered by the SL-oriented Strategies and Substitution, from the perspective of the target audience's plot interpretation of the drama, this paper concludes that an obvious disadvantage as a result of the Monocultural ECR's interlingual subtitling in Empresses in the Palace is that the plot revealed in the target-language subtitles becomes logically incoherent.

TI Brian Friel in Spain: An Off-Centre Love Story
SO ESTUDIOS IRLANDESES
AB Spanish theatres are not prolific in the staging of Irish playwrights. However, the Northern Irish writer Brian Friel (1929-2015) has been a curious exception, his plays having been performed in different cities in Spain since William Layton produced Amantes: vencedores y vencidos (Lovers: Winners and Losers) in 1972. The origin of Friel's popularity in this country may be attributed to what many theatre directors and audiences considered to be a parallel political situation between post-colonial Ireland and the historical peripheral communities with a language other than Spanish: Catalonia, the Basque Country and Galicia; the fact is that the number of Catalan directors who have staged works by Friel exceeds that of any other territory in Spain. However, despite the political identification that can be behind the success of a play like Translations (1980), the staging of others with a subtler political overtone, such as Lovers (1967), Dancing at Lughnasa (1990), Molly Sweeney (1994), Faith Healer (1979) and Afterplay (2001), should prompt us to find the reason for this imbalance of representation elsewhere. By analysing the production of the plays, both through the study of their programmes and interviews with their protagonists, and by scrutinising their reception, I have attempted to discern some common factors to account for the selection of Friel's dramatic texts.

SO ARCHIV FUR DAS STUDIUM DER NEUEREN SPRACHEN UND LITERATUREN
AB The paper is devoted to the poetics of the epistolary essay, a form of essayistic writing that became established around 1800 in both Germany and Italy. In particular, the excerpt from an exchange of letters on Ossian and the Songs of Ancient Peoples by Johann Gottfried Herder and the semi-serious Letter of Grisostomo to his son by Giovanni Berchet, together with the Italian translations of Burger's ballads contained therein, are analyzed and compared with each other, thereby showing how the epistolary essay proves to be a hybrid form par excellence, mixing lyricism, essay, prose and drama, life and fiction, writing and speech. It then identifies the main common sources (Vico, Condillac, Cesarotti) and the main mediators of Herder's ideas in Italy (Madame de Stael, Burger, the first Italian translations of Werther) that led Herder and Italian Romanticismo to develop the epistolary essay as a progressive universal poetry that breaks the boundaries of literary forms and unites different genres, philosophy, rhetoric and criticism.

TI Ferroptosis in Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Mechanisms, Drug Targets and
   Approaches to Clinical Translation
SO CANCERS
AB Simple Summary In recent decades, scientific discoveries brought up several new treatments and improvements for patients suffering from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, increasing resistance to current therapies, such as sorafenib, worsen the outcome of HCC patients, leading to a search for alternative therapeutic strategies. The term ferroptosis describes a novel form of regulated cell death, which is different from apoptosis and necroptosis in a mechanistical and morphological manner. The main mechanism, which leads to cell death, is lipid peroxidation, caused by iron overload and the accumulation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Recent studies demonstrate that ferroptosis can hamper the carcinogenesis in several tumor entities and in HCC. Therefore, a better understanding and a deeper insight in the processes of ferroptosis in HCC and the possible application of it in the clinical practice are of extreme importance. Ferroptosis, an iron and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent non-apoptotic type of regulated cell death, is characterized by a massive iron overload and peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which finally results in cell death. Recent studies suggest that ferroptosis can influence carcinogenesis negatively and therefore may be used as a novel anti-cancer strategy. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a deadly malignancy with poor chances of survival and is the second leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Diagnosis at an already late stage and general resistance to current therapies may be responsible for the dismal outcome. As the liver acts as a key factor in iron metabolism, ferroptosis is shown to play an important role in HCC carcinogenesis and, more importantly, may hold the potential to eradicate HCC. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge we have of the role of ferroptosis in HCC and the application of ferroptosis as a therapy option and provide an overview of the potential translation of ferroptosis in the clinical practice of HCC.

TI Editing melon eIF4E associates with virus resistance and male sterility
SO PLANT BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL
AB The cap-binding protein eIF4E, through its interaction with eIF4G, constitutes the core of the eIF4F complex, which plays a key role in the circularization of mRNAs and their subsequent cap-dependent translation. In addition to its fundamental role in mRNA translation initiation, other functions have been described or suggested for eIF4E, including acting as a proviral factor and participating in sexual development. We used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to generate melon eif4e knockout mutant lines. Editing worked efficiently in melon, as we obtained transformed plants with a single-nucleotide deletion in homozygosis in the first eIF4E exon already in a T0 generation. Edited and non-transgenic plants of a segregating F2 generation were inoculated with Moroccan watermelon mosaic virus (MWMV); homozygous mutant plants showed virus resistance, while heterozygous and non-mutant plants were infected, in agreement with our previous results with plants silenced in eIF4E. Interestingly, all homozygous edited plants of the T0 and F2 generations showed a male sterility phenotype, while crossing with wild-type plants restored fertility, displaying a perfect correlation between the segregation of the male sterility phenotype and the segregation of the eif4e mutation. Morphological comparative analysis of melon male flowers along consecutive developmental stages showed postmeiotic abnormal development for both microsporocytes and tapetum, with clear differences in the timing of tapetum degradation in the mutant versus wild-type. An RNA-Seq analysis identified critical genes in pollen development that were down-regulated in flowers of eif4e/eif4e plants, and suggested that eIF4E-specific mRNA translation initiation is a limiting factor for male gametes formation in melon.

TI Translating Quotidian Humor for the Contemporary Stage: Jose Luis Alonso
   de Santos's La estanquera de Vallecas
SO ROMANCE QUARTERLY
AB Jose Luis Alonso de Santos is the most commercially successful Spanish playwright of the post-Franco period in Spain. Although he has written across a wide range of dramatic forms and genres, he is best known for his modern comedies that have frequently been inspired more by cinematic than theatrical forms. On the one hand, a number of critics have accused him of playing to the gallery and repeating himself; conversely, however, his capacity to imbue conventional forms with contemporary characters and concerns has not only endeared him to a broad range of audiences but also warrants his inclusion within the canon of twentieth-century Spanish theater. Having previously translated his most popular and endearing play, Bajarse al moro, into English, I will begin this article with a discussion of the tragicomic humor in La estanquera de Vallecas, his first success, whose colloquial street dialogue marked a controversial break with the prevalent strain of literary and rhetorical theater in Spain. I will focus my discussion on how and why the humor derives from the play's intersection with quotidian urban concerns (rising crime, unemployment, etc.) and a dialectical interplay between imported cinematic forms and national theatrical traditions. This will pave the way for a discussion of the translation of theater into and out of Spanish on the page and stage in both pedagogical and professional environments.

TI Protein-Related Circular RNAs in Human Pathologies
SO CELLS
AB Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a distinct family of RNAs derived from alternative splicing which play a crucial role in regulating gene expression by acting as microRNA (miRNA) and RNA binding protein (RBP) sponges. However, recent studies have also reported the multifunctional potential of these particles. Under different conditions, circRNAs not only regulate protein synthesis, destination, and degradation but can serve as protein scaffolds or recruiters and are also able to produce short peptides with active biological functions. circRNAs are under ongoing investigation because of their close association with the development of diseases. Some circRNAs are reportedly expressed in a tissue- and development stage-specific manner. Furthermore, due to other features of circRNAs, including their stability, conservation, and high abundance in bodily fluids, they are believed to be potential biomarkers for various diseases, including cancers. In this review, we focus on providing a summary of the current knowledge on circRNA-protein interactions. We present the properties and functions of circRNAs, the possible mechanisms of their translation abilities, and the emerging functions of circRNA-derived peptides in human pathologies.

TI Overexpression of Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 5A2 (EIF5A2)
   Correlates with Cell Aggressiveness and Poor Survival in Gastric Cancer
SO PLOS ONE
AB Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A2 (EIF5A2) plays an important role in tumor progression and prognosis evaluation. However, little information is available about its potential role in gastric cancer. This study aimed to investigate the function of EIF5A2 in tumor progression and its potential mechanisms. EIF5A2 expression was measured in human gastric cancer cell lines, the immortalized gastric mucosal epithelial cell line (GES-1) and human gastric cancer tissues and knocked down by RNA interference or upregulated by EIF5A2 plasmid transfection. Cell proliferation, migration and invasion were assessed in vitro. The downstream targets of EIF5A2 were examined by western blotting. EIF5A2 and its potential target metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1) expression were examined in 160 pairs of human gastric cancer and adjacent non-tumor specimens using immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, and its correlation with clinicopathological features and survival was investigated. Knockdown of EIF5A2 or MTA1 caused an apparent suppression of HGC27 cell proliferation, migration and invasion. After knockdown of EIF5A2 in HGC27 cells, E-cadherin levels were upregulated and vimentin, cyclin D1, cyclin D3, C-MYC and MTA1 levels were downregulated. Upregulation of EIF5A2 in MKN45 cells resulted in the converse. IHC results showed a positive correlation between EIF5A2 and MTA1 expression in gastric cancers (P< 0.001). Both EIF5A2 and MTA1 overexpression were correlated with pT stage (P= 0.018 and P= 0.042), pN stage (P= 0.037 and P= 0.020) and lymphovascular invasion (P= 0.016 and P= 0.044). EIF5A2 or MTA1 overexpression was significantly associated with poor overall survival and disease-free survival (All P< 0.05). Multivariate analyses identified EIF5A2 as an independent predictor for both overall survival (P= 0.012) and disease-free survival (P= 0.008) in gastric cancer patients. Our findings indicate that EIF5A2 upregulation plays an important oncogenic role in gastric cancer. EIF5A2 may represent a new predictor for poor survival and is a potential therapeutic target for gastric cancer.

TI The Arabic Adventures of Telemaque: Trajectory of a Global Enlightenment
   Text in the Nahdah
SO JOURNAL OF ARABIC LITERATURE
AB The Marquis de Fenelon's internationally popular didactic narrative, Les aventures de Telemaque, went through a remarkable number of metamorphoses in the Nahdah, the Arab world's cultural revival movement of the long nineteenth century. This article examines two early manuscript translations by Syrian Christian writers in the 1810s, the rhymed prose version by Rifa'ah Rafi al-Tahawi in the 1860s; its rewriting by Shahin. 'Atiyyah in 1885; and Sa'dallah al-Bustani's musical drama of 1869, the basis for performances later in the century by the famous actor Salamah Hijazi. Placing Telemaque's Arabic trajectory within its global vogue in the Enlightenment suggests ways of reading the Nahdah between theories of world literature and 'transnational mass-texts', and more specific local histories of translation and literary adaptation. The ambiguity of Telemaque, its hybrid and transitional form, was important to its success in milieux facing analogous kinds of hybridity and transition-among them those of the Arab Nahdah.

TI Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 4 Gamma 1 (eIF4G1) is
   upregulated during Prostate cancer progression and modulates cell growth
   and metastasis
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB eIF4G1, a critical component of the eIF4F complex, is required for cap-dependent mRNA translation, a process necessary for tumor growth and survival. However, the role of eIF4G1 has not been evaluated in Prostate Cancer (PCa). We observed an increased eIF4G1 protein levels in PCa tissues as compared to normal tissues. Analysis of the TCGA data revealed that eIF4G1 gene expression positively correlated with higher tumor grade and stage. Furthermore, eIF4G1 was over-expressed and or amplified, in 16% patients with metastatic PCa (SU2C/PCF Dream Team dataset) and in 59% of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients (Trento/Cornell/Broad dataset). We showed for the first time that eIF4G1 expression was increased in PCa and that increased eIF4G1 expression associated with tumor progression and metastasis. We also observed high protein levels of eIF4G1 in PCa cell lines and prostate tissues from the TRAMP model of PCa as compared to normal prostate cell line and prostate tissues from the wild type mice. Knockdown of eIF4G1 in PCa cells resulted in decreased Cyclin D1 and p-Rb protein level, cell cycle delay, reduced cell viability and proliferation, impaired clonogenic activity, reduced cell migration and decreased mRNA loading to polysomes. Treatment with eIF4G complex inhibitor also impaired prostasphere formation. eIF4G1 knockdown or treatment with eIF4G complex inhibitor sensitized CRPC cells to Enzalutamide and Bicalutamide. Our results showed that eIF4G1 plays an important role in PCa growth and therapeutic resistance. These data suggested that eIF4G1 functions as an oncoprotein and may serve as a novel target for intervention in PCa and CRPC.

TI Decreased expression of eukaryotic initiation factor 3f is an adverse
   prognostic factor for stage I-III gastric cancer
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
AB Background: It has been demonstrated that eIF3f expression is significantly decreased in many human cancers, a fact which plays an important role in human cancer. However, the expression of eIF3f in gastric cancer (GC) is not well understood to date. Therefore, the aim of this study is to detect the expression of eIF3f in GC.
   Methods: The expression of eIF3f was examined by immunohistochemistry in tissues with stage I to III GC and adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANCT) of 195 gastrectomy specimens; clinicopathological results, including survival, were analyzed.
   Results: The positive expression rate of eIF3f was significantly higher in ANCT tissues than in GC. eIF3f levels were correlated with more advanced tumor stages and likelihood of recurrence (all P < 0.05). The Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated that decreased expression of eIF3f could serve as a prognosis marker for poor outcome of GC patients (P = 0.04).
   Conclusions: eIF3f may play an important role in recurrence, thus representing a promising predictive marker for the prognosis of GC.

TI Plasmodium falciparum DOZI, an RNA helicase interacts with eIF4E
SO GENE
AB DEAD box RNA helicases play crucial roles in RNA metabolism such as splicing, ribosome biogenesis, RNA transport, degradation and translation. DDX6/DOZI (development of zygote inhibited) is one of the well characterized member of the DEAD box family and is highly conserved from humans to malaria parasite. DDX6 is involved in a variety of biological processes, which include the sexual development of the protozoan parasite. In the present manuscript we report that P. falciparum DOZI (DDX6 homologue); PfDZ50 contains the characteristic DNA and RNA binding, nucleic acid-dependent ATPase and RNA unwinding activities. Enzymatic characterization of truncated derivatives of PfDZ50 such as PfDZ50T1 (domain 1) and PfDZ50T2 (domain 2) shows that none of them contains ATPase activity. Furthermore, we confirmed that PfDZ50 interacts with PfelF4E mainly through domain 1. Using in vitro translation assays we show that PfDZ50 inhibits translation. With the same assays we further report that externally added PfeIF4E restores similar to 70% of translation. Using immunofluorescence assays we demonstrate that PfDZ50 is localized mainly in the cytoplasm in the asexual intraerythrocytic developmental stages of P. falciparum. The localization pattern further suggests that PfDZ50 appears typically in granular bodies throughout the cytoplasm. Thus these studies will advance our knowledge regarding the function of PfDZ50/DDX6 in general. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Intercultural theatre? A 'Streetcar Named Desire' on the Turkish stage
   (Ferdi Merter)
SO THEATRE RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB The controversial theory of intercultural performance covers a wide range of theatrical practices, which intend to adapt subject matter and situations from one culture to another This intention mainly involves a transportation and translation of elements and perspectives across cultures. The translator, the audience or reader, and the director fill in the gaps that are formed during this transportation and translation with their own interpretations, in accordance with the culture they inhabit. However, intercultural performance requires conscious attempts to merge two different cultures. Such attempts should not be done solely for the 'target' culture's audience but should also regard the perceptions of the 'source' culture as much as possible. In light of this, Turkish State Theatre's director Ferdi Merter's production of A Streetcar Named Desire is analysed in order to locate the distinct changes the Turkish interpretation of the play has incorporated.

TI CULTURAL SPECIFICS OF FICTION TEXTS: THE CASE OF RUSSIAN LITERATURE
SO REVISTA GENERO & DIREITO
AB Authors have considered a special stage in the life and its reflection on the works of the world-famous Russian poet, novelist, and the Nobel Prize winner in literature Boris Pasternak in his three year evacuation period during the World War II in Chistopol - a small town on the Kama River. During that time Boris Pasternak was mostly translating. The study is focused on the cultural specifics of fiction texts, i.e. texts translated or created by B. Pasternak. Within the first two months staying in Chistopol the poet translated the play 'Romeo and Juliet' by Shakespeare, and then the great cycle of poems by Juliusz Slowacki, poems and the tragedy 'Mary Stuart' written by Shiller. At the same time he implements a great idea he had planned long before - he translates 'Antony and Cleopatra'. The study highlights cultural peculiarities of Pasternak's translations and his own style reflected in fiction. The research states the ambiguous attitude of critics to Pasternak's translations. He was both considered as the brilliant translator and criticized for liberty, inadequacy and excessive individuality.

TI 'Oioi - Oioi - Iehieh!' Democracy in Crisis! Aeschylus' Persians for
   Contemporary Stages
SO EUROPEAN LEGACY-TOWARD NEW PARADIGMS
AB This article attempts a reinterpretation of Aeschylus' Persians as primarily a warning about the instability of democracy following a major military victory against an overpowering totalitarian enemy. It discusses the historical and our contemporary ideas of the democratic principles of government versus the constant tendency towards a strongman regime. I argue that the play's underlying philosophy is based on the Heraclitan idea of constant flux, which predates our modern ideas of the relativity of time and space, and the core concept underpinning any democracy that the only constant thing about it is continuous change. A short retrospective of modern productions of The Persians reveals the relationship between history and current events that can or cannot be associated with the play. By treating the thorny issue of translations and adaptations and the temptations of simplistic patriotic or antiwar interpretations of the play, the article also addresses the challenging task of determining what constitutes a just war and why a democracy is necessarily engaged in a continuous defensive battle against the forces of totalitarianism.

TI Identification of protein profile in metacyclic and amastigote-like
   stages of Leishmania tropica: a proteomic approach
SO AMB EXPRESS
AB Leishmaniasis is a tropical disease that leads to various clinical phenotypes. This study aimed to investigate protein expression changes in metacyclic and amastigote-like stages of L. tropica isolated from Iranian cutaneous leishmaniasis patients. Isolated samples were cultured and species type identified using PCR-RFLP technique. The promastigotes were grown in RPMI1640 media and differentiated to metacyclic and amastigote-like forms, followed by the extracted proteins of both successive stages carried out for proteomics and bioinformatics analysis. Using SWATH-MS quantitative proteomics technique, a total 176 and 155 distinct proteins were identified in metacyclic and axenic amastigote stages, respectively. Of these, 65 proteins were altered significantly (p-value <0.05 and fold change >= 2) between studied stages. Several gene ontology (GO) categories were enriched for biological process during conversion of metacyclic promastigotes into amastigote-like, which "metabolic process" (GO: 0044281, P-Value: 6.52e-5), and "translation" (GO: 0006412, p-value: 5.01e-14) were disclosed as the top category in up and down-regulated proteins, respectively. Also, the KEGG pathway analysis indicated "metabolic pathways" and "ribosome"term as the most important pathways in up and down-regulated proteins, respectively. According to protein interaction network analysis, enolase (ENOL) has been detected as main hub proteins during differentiation, followed by Putative NADH-dependent fumarate reductase (LmjF.35.1180) and 40S ribosomal protein S2 (LmjF.32.0450). Overall, protein changes possibly play important roles in L. tropica biology. Anabolic pathways were down-regulated, whereas catabolic pathways were up-regulated during L. tropica differentiation. These protein expression changes could provide parasite survival in host macrophages, and could use as novel potential drug and vaccine targets for leishmaniasis.

TI 'Je n'ai pas envie de chanter ce soir': A Re-examination of Samuel
   Beckett's Opera Collaboration Krapp, ou La Derniere bande
SO NEW THEATRE QUARTERLY
AB This article re-examines Krapp, ou La Derniere bande (1961), an opera adaptation of Samuel Beckett's Krapp's Last Tape (1958), which was a collaboration between the playwright and the Romanian composer Marcel Mihalovici. Beckett's changes to the libretto give new insights into the writer's developing concerns around form and his aesthetic of failure. In the programme for the Bielefeld production of the opera in 1961, Beckett supplied a sentence from the German translation of his Texts for Nothing, although inverting its first two clauses. His inclusion of this line in the programme affords us greater insight into Beckett's ever evolving conception of the play. Shane O'Neill's doctoral research on Samuel Beckett's self-translated drama is funded by the Irish Research Council. He teaches at Mary Immaculate College, University of Limerick, and has published essays in Samuel Beckett Today/Aujourd'hui and the edited volume Samuel Beckett and Translation (Edinburgh University Press, 2021).

TI Performing Heteroglossia: The Translating Theatre Project in London
SO MODERN DRAMA
AB London is home to more than eight million people, who speak more than three hundred languages, but the representation of this cultural richness and diversity in the theatre of the British capital is far from adequate. London theatre remains predominantly white, British, and middle-class, and performances use the standard London dialect and accent combination. In the first part of this article, I offer a contextualization and classification of types of heteroglossia available to London theatregoers. In the second part, I describe my research project "Translation, Adaptation, Otherness: 'Foreignisation' in Theatre Practice." The aim of the project was to investigate new strategies in theatre translation that would enable us to disrupt audience expectations and challenge ethnocentrism. In the present article, I assess the difficulties we encountered and audiences' responses to our experiments. The project offered many timely opportunities to interrogate perceptions of "foreignness" among London-based theatre makers, scholars, and spectators immediately following the Brexit referendum vote.

TI Regulation and roles of elongation factor 2 kinase
SO BIOCHEMICAL SOCIETY TRANSACTIONS
AB Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K) belongs to the small family of atypical protein kinases termed a-kinases, and is the only calcium/calmodulin (Ca/CaM)-dependent member of that group. It phosphorylates and inactivates eEF2, to slow down the rate of elongation, the stage in mRNA translation that consumes almost all the energy and amino acids consumed by protein synthesis. In addition to activation by Ca/CaM, eEF2K is also regulated by an array of other regulatory inputs, which include inhibition by the nutrient-and growth-factor activated signalling pathways. Recent evidence shows that eEF2K plays an important role in learning and memory, processes that require the synthesis of new proteins and involve Ca-mediated signalling. eEF2K is activated under conditions of nutrient and energy depletion. In cancer cells, or certain tumours, eEF2K exerts cytoprotective effects, which probably reflect its ability to inhibit protein synthesis, and nutrient consumption, under starvation conditions. eEF2K is being evaluated as a potential therapeutic target in cancer.

TI Functional characterization of the ABCG2 5 ' non-coding exon variants:
   Stem cell specificity, translation efficiency and the influence of drug
   selection
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-GENE REGULATORY MECHANISMS
AB ABCG2 is a multidrug transporter with wide substrate specificity, and is believed to protect several cell types from various xenobiotics and endobiotics. This "guardian" function is important in numerous cell types and tissue barriers but becomes disadvantageous by being responsible for the multidrug resistance phenotype in certain tumor cells. ABCG2 regulation at the protein level has already been extensively studied, however, regulation at the mRNA level, especially the functional role of the various 5' untranslated exon variants (5' UTRs) has been elusive. In the present work, we describe a comprehensive characterization of four ABCG2 mRNA variants with different exon 1 sequences, investigate drug inducibility, stem cell specificity, mRNA stability, and translation efficiency. Although certain variants (E1B and E1C) are considered as "constitutive" mRNA isoforms, we show that chemotoxic drugs significantly alter the expression pattern of distinct ABCG2 mRNA isoforms. When examining human embryonic stem cell lines, we provide evidence that variant E1A has an expression pattern coupled to undifferentiated stem cell stage, as its transcript level is regulated parallel to mRNAs of Oct4 and Nanog pluripotency marker genes. When characterizing the four exon 1 variants we found no significant differences in terms of mRNA stabilities and half-lives of the isoforms. In contrast, variant E1U showed markedly lower translation efficiency both at the total protein level or regarding the functional presence in the plasma membrane. Taken together, these results indicate that the different 5' UTR variants play an important role in cell type specific regulation and fine tuning of ABCG2 expression. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI Rosalind and Sakuntala among the Ascetics: Reading Gender and Female
   Sexual Agency in a Bengali Adaptation of As You Like It
SO MULTICULTURAL SHAKESPEARE-TRANSLATION APPROPRIATION AND PERFORMANCE
AB My article examines how the staging of gender and sexuality in Shakespeare's play As You Like It is negotiated in a Bengali adaptation, Ananga-Rangini (1897) by the little-known playwright Annadaprasad Basu. The Bengali adaptation does not assume the boy actor's embodied performance as essential to its construction of the Rosalind-equivalent, and thereby it misses several of the accents on gender and sexuality that characterize Shakespeare's play. The Bengali adaptation, while accommodating much of Rosalind's flamboyance, is more insistent upon the heteronormative closure and reconfigures the Rosalind-character as an acquiescent lover/wife. Further, Ananga-Rangini incorporates resonances of the classical Sanskrit play Abhijnanasakuntalam by Kalidasa, thus suggesting a thematic interaction between the two texts and giving a concrete shape to the comparison between Shakespeare and Kalidasa that formed a favourite topic of literary debate in colonial Bengal. The article takes into account how the Bengali adaptation of As You Like It may be influenced by the gender politics informing Abhijnanasakuntalam and by the reception of this Sanskrit play in colonial Bengal.

TI iTRAQ-Based Quantitative Proteomic Analysis of a Toxigenic
   Dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella at Different Stages of Toxin
   Biosynthesis during the Cell Cycle
SO MARINE DRUGS
AB Paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) are a group of potent neurotoxic alkaloids that are produced mainly by marine dinoflagellates. PST biosynthesis in dinoflagellates is a discontinuous process that is coupled to the cell cycle. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying this association. Here, we compared global protein expression profiles of a toxigenic dinoflagellate, Alexandrium catenella, collected at four different stages of toxin biosynthesis during the cell cycle, using an isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomic approach. The results showed that toxin biosynthesis occurred mainly in the G1 phase, especially the late G1 phase. In total, 7232 proteins were confidently identified, and 210 proteins exhibited differential expression among the four stages. Proteins involved in protein translation and photosynthetic pigment biosynthesis were significantly upregulated during toxin biosynthesis, indicating close associations among the three processes. Nine toxin-related proteins were detected, and two core toxin biosynthesis proteins, namely, sxtA and sxtI, were identified for the first time in dinoflagellates. Among these proteins, sxtI and ompR were significantly downregulated when toxin biosynthesis stopped, indicating that they played important roles in the regulation of PST biosynthesis. Our study provides new insights into toxin biosynthesis in marine dinoflagellates: nitrogen balance among different biological processes regulates toxin biosynthesis, and that glutamate might play a key modulatory role.

TI High expression of PP2A-A alpha is associated with diapause induction
   during the photoperiod-sensitive stage of the cotton bollworm,
   Helicoverpa armigera
SO JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY
AB Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a major serine-threonine protein phosphatase which regulates metabolism, transcription, RNA splicing, translation, differentiation, cell cycle, oncogenic transformation and signal transduction. PP2A-A alpha, an isoform of PP2A-A, is a structural subunit of the PP2A complex. We identified the photoperiod-sensitive stage for pupal diapause induction to be from the fifth instar to the early sixth instar larvae in the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera. PP2A-A alpha cDNA from brains of diapausedestined fifth instar larvae was obtained by suppressive subtractive hybridization using nondiapausedestined larval brains as a control. Developmental expression of PP2A-A alpha mRNA during the photoperiod-sensitive stage was higher in brains of diapause-destined larvae, and the PP2A-A alpha protein showed a similar expression pattern as the mRNA. When larvae were transferred from diapause-inducing short days to long days during the diapause-sensitive stage, both PP2A-A alpha mRNA and protein decreased significantly, and diapause incidence was also reduced. Thus, high PP2A-A alpha expression during the diapausesensitive stage may play a crucial role in photoperiodic induction of diapause, suggesting that it may be a new player involved in the molecular mechanism for diapause induction.

TI An Effective Translation: The Development of Hyaluronan-Based Medical
   Products From the Physicochemical, and Preclinical Aspects
SO FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB This review shows the steps toward material selection focalized on the design and development of medical devices based on hyaluronan (HA). The selection is based on chemical and mechanical properties, biocompatibility, sterilization, safety, and scale-up costs. These facts play a vital role in the industrialization process. Approved medical devices containing-HA are illustrated to identify key parameters. The first part of this work involves the steps toward a complete characterization of chemical and mechanical aspects, reproducibility of the processes and scale up. In a second stage, we aimed to describe the preclinical in vitro and in vivo assays and selected examples of clinical trials. Furthermore, it is important to keep in mind the regulatory affairs during the research and development (R&D) using standardization (ISO standards) to achieve the main goal, which is the functionality and safety of the final device. To keep reproducible experimental data to prepare an efficient master file for the device, based on quality and recorded manufacturing data, and a rigorous R&D process may help toward clinical translation. A strong debate is still going on because the denominated basic research in HA field does not pay attention to the purity and quality of the raw materials used during the development. So that, to achieve the next generation of devices is needed to overcome the limitations of state of art in terms of efficacy, biodegradability, and non-toxicity.

TI Detection of the MicroRNA expression profile in skeletal muscles of burn
   trauma at the early stage in rats
SO ULUSAL TRAVMA VE ACIL CERRAHI DERGISI-TURKISH JOURNAL OF TRAUMA &
   EMERGENCY SURGERY
AB BACKGROUND: Severe burn injuries are associated with a persistent hypermetabolic response, which causes long-term loss of muscle mass that results in a clinical negative balance of nitrogen and muscle wasting. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a critical role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, which negatively regulates gene expression by promoting degradation of target mRNAs or inhibiting their translation. However, the mechanisms of skeletal muscle wasting after severe burn involved in miRNAs still remain unclear.
   METHODS: In this study, the alterations of miRNAs expression profile in skeletal muscles of thermal rats were detected at an early stage by microarray. All data were presented as mean +/- SD. Statistical analysis was determined by independent Student's t-test and one-way ANOVA. The significance was all set at p<0.05, and fold change cut-off was 2.0 for microarray. Significant differentially expressed miRNAs were identified through Volcano Plot filtering. Hierarchical clustering was performed using MEV software (v4.6, TIGR).
   RESULTS: Thousands of miRNAs could be examined in normal and injured tissues, but only 69 of these were significantly upregulated or down-regulated, which could be used to discriminate skeletal muscles of thermal rats from matched tissues.
   CONCLUSION: The deregulated miRNAs probably play a potential role in the pathogenesis of skeletal muscle wasting in burn trauma.

TI Strategies of translating swear words into Arabic: a case study of a
   parallel corpus of Netflix English-Arabic movie subtitles
SO HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS
AB This study adopts a corpus-assisted approach to explore the translation strategies that Netflix subtitlers opted for in rendering 1564 English swear words into Arabic. It uses a 699,229-word English-Arabic parallel corpus consisting of the English transcriptions of forty English movies, drama, action, science fiction (sci-fi), and biography and their Arabic subtitles. Using the wordlist tool in SketchEngine, the researchers identified some frequent swear words, namely fuck, shit, damn, ass, bitch, bastard, asshole, dick, cunt, and pussy. Moreover, using the parallel concordance tool in SketchEngine revealed that three translation strategies were observed in the corpus, namely, omission, softening, and swear-to-non-swear. The omission strategy accounted for the lion's share in the investigated data, with 66% for drama, 61% for action, 52% for biography, and 40% for sci-fi. On the other hand, the swear-to-non-swear strategy was the least adopted one, accounting for 21% in sci-fi, 16% in biography, 14% in drama, and 11% in action. In addition, the softening strategy got the second-highest frequency across the different movie genres, with 39% for sci-fi, 32% for biography, 28% for action, and 20% for drama. Since swear words have connotative functions, omitting or euphemizing them could cause a slight change in the representation of meaning and characters. The study recommends more corpus-assisted studies on different AVT modes, including dubbing, voiceover, and free commentaries.

TI Being European: Hamlet on the Israeli Stage
SO MULTICULTURAL SHAKESPEARE-TRANSLATION APPROPRIATION AND PERFORMANCE
AB One of the most prolific fields of Shakespeare studies in the past two decades has been the exploration of local appropriations of Shakespeare's plays around the world. This article, however, foregrounds a peculiar case of an avoidance of local appropriation. For almost 60 years, repertory Israeli theaters mostly refused to let Hamlet reflect the "age and body of the time". They repeatedly invited Europeans to direct Hamlet in Israel and offered local audiences locally-irrelevant productions of the play. They did so even though local productions of canonical plays in Israel tend to be more financially successful than those directed by non-Israelis, and even when local national and political circumstances bore a striking resemblance to the plot of the play. Conversely, when one Israeli production of Hamlet (originating in an experimental theatre) did try to hold a mirror up to Israeli society-and was indeed understood abroad as doing so-Israeli audiences and theatre critics failed to recognize their reflection in this mirror. The article explores the various functions that Hamlet has served for the Israeli theatre: a rite of passage, an educational tool, an indication of belonging to the European cultural tradition, a means of boosting the prestige of Israeli theatres, and-only finally-a mirror reflecting Israel's "age and body." The article also shows how, precisely because Hamlet was not allowed to reflect local concerns, the play mirrors instead the evolution of the Israeli theatre, its conflicted relation to the Western theatrical tradition, and its growing self-confidence.

TI The RNA-binding protein Puf1 functions in the maintenance of gametocytes
   in Plasmodium falciparum
SO JOURNAL OF CELL SCIENCE
AB Translation control plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, especially in transition stages between the vertebrate host and mosquito vector. Here, we determined the function of the Puf-family member Puf1 (denoted as PfPuf1 for the P. falciparum protein) during P. falciparum sexual development. We show that PfPuf1 was expressed in all gametocyte stages and at higher levels in female gametocytes. PfPuf1 disruption did not interfere with the asexual erythrocyte cycle of the parasite but resulted in an approximately tenfold decrease of mature gametocytes. In the PfPuf1-disrupted lines, gametocytes appeared normal before stage III but subsequently exhibited a sharp decline in gametocytemia. This was accompanied by a concomitant accumulation of dead and dying late-stage gametocytes, which retained normal gross morphology. In addition, significantly more female gametocytes were lost in the PfPuf1-disrupted lines during development, resulting in a reversed male-to-female sex ratio. These results indicate that PfPuf1 is important for the differentiation and maintenance of gametocytes, especially female gametocytes.

TI Pathogenic Roles of RNA-Binding Proteins in Sarcomas
SO CANCERS
AB Simple Summary DNA information can be copied into mRNA (this process is called transcription) and proteins can be subsequently synthesized using the information in mRNA as a template (called translation). Approximately 4000 RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in the cells coordinately regulate these multiple processes between transcription and translation. It has been recently recognized that some of the RBPs have abnormal expression and/or function, leading to the initiation or maintenance of malignant disorders including sarcomas, which is the general term for a broad group of malignancies that begin in the bones and soft tissue. Unfortunately, there are currently very few effective treatments for many types of sarcomas in advanced stages. Therefore, we need to understand more deeply how sarcomas develop in our body and how they are efficiently eradicated by therapeutic intervention. Studies on the disease mechanisms in terms of RBPs will provide us with the opportunity to have a better understanding of the sarcoma pathogenesis. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are proteins that physically and functionally bind to RNA to regulate the RNA metabolism such as alternative splicing, polyadenylation, transport, maintenance of stability, localization, and translation. There is accumulating evidence that dysregulated RBPs play an essential role in the pathogenesis of malignant tumors including a variety of types of sarcomas. On the other hand, prognosis of patients with sarcoma, especially with sarcoma in advanced stages, is very poor, and almost no effective standard treatment has been established for most of types of sarcomas so far, highlighting the urgent need for identifying novel therapeutic targets based on the deep understanding of pathogenesis. Therefore, defining the network of interactions between RBPs and disease-related RNA targets will contribute to a better understanding of sarcomagenesis and identification of a novel therapeutic target for sarcomas.

SO BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE
AB Sex hormones play an essential role in sexual differentiation, maintenance of sexual characteristics, gamete maturation, and mating behavior. However, very little is known about their dynamics in molluscs. We conducted a study on sex hormone (17 beta-estradiol, testosterone, and progesterone) concentrations in male and female Strombus pugilis to identify their variations at different gonadal stages. A total of 90 organisms (30 per month) were collected in February, September, and November 2016. The gonadal digestive gland complex of each specimen was dissected and divided into two sections. One section was set in alcoholic Bouin's fluid and processed with classic histological techniques; the second was macerated with 80% ethanol to extract steroids and analyzed by enzyme immunoassays. Histological section analysis was used to classify gonadal development into three stages: gametogenesis, mature, and undifferentiated. Mature females were observed in September. Testosterone and 17 beta-estradiol concentrations in both sexes were highest in the mature stage. In S. pugilis, 17 beta-estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone were all present, with higher concentrations associated with reproductive activity.

TI Conserved RNA Binding Activity of Phosphatidyl Inositol 5-Phosphate
   4-Kinase (PIP4K2A)
SO FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR BIOSCIENCES
AB Plasmodium falciparum is a causative agent for malaria and has a complex life cycle in human and mosquito hosts. During its life cycle, the malarial parasite Plasmodium goes through different asexual and sexual stages, in humans and mosquitoes. Expression of stage-specific proteins is important for successful completion of its life cycle and requires tight gene regulation. In the case of Plasmodium, due to relative paucity of the transcription factors, it is postulated that posttranscriptional regulation plays an important role in stage-specific gene expression. Translation repression of specific set of mRNA has been reported in gametocyte stages of the parasite. A conserved element present in the 3 ' UTR of some of these transcripts was identified. Phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinase (PIP4K2A) was identified as the protein that associates with these RNA. We now show that the RNA binding activity of PIP4K2A is independent of its kinase activity. We also observe that PIP4K2A is imported into the parasite from the host on Plasmodium berghei and Toxoplasma gondii. The RNA binding activity of PIP4K2A seems to be conserved across species from Drosophila and C. elegans to humans, suggesting that the RNA binding activity of PIP4K may be important, and there may be host transcripts that may be regulated by PIP4K2A. These results identify a novel RNA binding role for PIP4K2A that may not only play a role in Plasmodium propagation but may also function in regulating gene expression in multicellular organisms.

TI Molecular cloning and expression analysis of the highly conserved
   eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A) from Antheraea
   pernyi
SO ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB Eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A) is a highly conserved protein found in all eukaryotic organisms that plays a key role in the regulation of many cellular processes including translation elongation, cell proliferation, programmed cell death, mRNA turnover and decay, and abiotic stress responses. In this study, the eIF-5A gene from the Chinese oak silkworm Antheraea pernyi (Lepidoptera: Saturniidae) was characterized. The full-length ApeIF-5A cDNA of 1056bp includes a 5-untranslated region (UTR) of 138bp, a 3'-UTR of 435 BP, and an open reading frame of 483bp encoding a polypeptide of 160 amino acids. The deduced ApeIF-5A protein shares 99%, 82%, and 72% sequence identity with orthologs in Bombyx mori, Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens, indicating high conservation during animal evolution. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR revealed expression in all four developmental stages and in all nine tissues tested, consistent with an important role in development. After challenge with lipopolysaccharide, the expression levels of ApeIF-5A were markedly upregulated. Phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequences revealed A. pernyi eIF-5A was closely related to B. mori eIF-5A, consistent with traditional classification and other molecular data. The results indicate the potential value of eIF-5A in phylogenetic analysis.

TI Topographic species-habitat associations of tree species in a
   heterogeneous tropical karst seasonal rain forest, China
SO JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY
AB Aims
   Tropical and subtropical karst forests of south China are under increasing pressure from over-exploitation causing widespread habitat degradation and biodiversity loss. Previous research has demonstrated that topography, as a proxy for resource availability, plays an important role in shaping tree species distributions in tropical forests. However, the association between growth stages and habitats types has not been considered in this analysis. Our aim was to examine the differences among different habitat types to determine whether tree species show similar species-habitat associations at young and mature life stages.
   Methods
   We used multivariate regression tree analysis to examined specieshabitat associations among eight topographically defined habitats. The results were tested with a torus-translation test and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) for 74 species in a 15 ha karst tropical seasonal rain forest at the Nonggang National Natural Reserve in south China. We considered two life stages (young and mature) of trees species that showed a positive association with topography.
   Important Findings
   We found marked differences in community characteristics and number of associations among the eight habitats. Of the 74 species subjected to torus-translation test, 63 had significant positive and 70 had significant negative associations with one or more of the eight habitats. Positive associations were more frequent in higher elevation habitats and negative associations were more frequent in lower elevation habitats. This suggests that edaphic and hydrological variation related to topography play important roles in habitat partitioning in heterogeneous karst forests. For the 63 tree species with significant positive associations to at least one habitat, 40 of them had the same positive association at young and mature life stages. The CCA revealed that the six topographic variables considered had consistent relationships with species distribution among all individuals and their two life stages. This indicates that most of the karst forest tree species show consistent associations with a single habitat throughout their life. We conclude that niche differentiation plays an important role in maintaining the diversity of this heterogeneous species-rich karst forest.

TI Influenza A Virus-Induced Degradation of Eukaryotic Translation
   Initiation Factor 4B Contributes to Viral Replication by Suppressing
   IFITM3 Protein Expression
SO JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
AB Although alteration in host cellular translation machinery occurs in virus-infected cells, the role of such alteration and the precise pathogenic processes are not well understood. Influenza A virus (IAV) infection shuts off host cell gene expression at transcriptional and translational levels. Here, we found that the protein level of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B (eIF4B), an integral component of the translation initiation apparatus, was dramatically reduced in A549 cells as well as in the lung, spleen, and thymus of mice infected with IAV. The decrease in eIF4B level was attributed to lysosomal degradation of eIF4B, which was induced by viral NS1 protein. Silencing eIF4B expression in A549 cells significantly promoted IAV replication, and conversely, overexpression of eIF4B markedly inhibited the viral replication. Importantly, we observed that eIF4B knockdown transgenic mice were more susceptible to IAV infection, exhibiting faster weight loss, shorter survival time, and more-severe organ damage. Furthermore, we demonstrated that eIF4B regulated the expression of interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), a critical protein involved in immune defense against a variety of RNA viruses, including influenza virus. Taken together, our findings reveal that eIF4B plays an important role in host defense against IAV infection at least by regulating the expression of IFITM3, which restricts viral entry and thereby blocks early stages of viral production. These data also indicate that influenza virus has evolved a strategy to overcome host innate immunity by downregulating eIF4B protein.
   IMPORTANCE
   Influenza A virus (IAV) infection stimulates the host innate immune system, in part, by inducing interferons (IFNs). Secreted IFNs activate the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway, leading to elevated transcription of a large group of IFN-stimulated genes that have antiviral function. To circumvent the host innate immune response, influenza virus has evolved multiple strategies for suppressing the production of IFNs. Here, we show that IAV infection induces lysosomal degradation of eIF4B protein; and eIF4B inhibits IAV replication by upregulating expression of interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), a key protein that protects the host from virus infection. Our finding illustrates a critical role of eIF4B in the host innate immune response and provides novel insights into the complex mechanisms by which influenza virus interacts with its host.

SO ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SLAWISTIK
AB Largely unobserved by philological research, the Czech culture has shown far above average receptiveness to a number of Russian dramatists, among them M. Ju. Lermontov. While the English speaking world keeps waiting for a translation of the canonic version of "Maskarad" (1835), there have been three independent Czech translations of this play by Frantikk Taborsky (1929), Frantikk Pikk (1941) and Emanuel Frynta (1951). Comparative analysis of these translations out of which two have been staged proves to forward the interpretation of this complex piece of dramatic literature ("a problem of interpretation forever", Frynta). A discussion of several Czech theatre productions of "Maskarad" between 1941 and 2008 reveals historical and cultural context, but also impressive cases of actualization in all of these productions.

TI YTHDF1 Promotes Cyclin B1 Translation through m(6)A Modulation and
   Contributes to the Poor Prognosis of Lung Adenocarcinoma with KRAS/TP53
   Co-Mutation
SO CELLS
AB KRAS and TP53 mutations are the two most common driver mutations in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and they appear to reduce latency and increase metastatic proclivity when a KRAS and TP53 co-mutation (KRAS/TP53-mut) occurs. However, the molecular mechanism involved is unclear. N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A), the most abundant RNA modification in mammal mRNAs, plays a critical role in tumorigenesis. Here, we used genomic and transcriptomic data and found that only LUAD patients with KRAS/TP53-mut, but not an individual mutation, appeared to exhibit poor overall survival when compared with patients without KRAS and TP53 mutation (wildtype). Subsequently, we analyzed the differential expression of the 15-m(6)A-related genes in LUAD with different mutations and found that YTHDF1 was the most upregulated in KRAS/TP53-mut patients and associated with their adverse prognosis. Bioinformatics and experimental evidence indicated that elevated YTHDF1 functionally promoted the translation of cyclin B1 mRNA in an m(6)A-dependent manner, thereby facilitating the tumor proliferation and poor prognosis of LUAD with KRAS/TP53-mut. Furthermore, the concurrent increase in YTHDF1 and cyclin B1 was confirmed by immunohistochemistry staining in patients with co-occurring KRAS/TP53 mutations. YTHDF1 was correlated with an unfavorable clinical stage and tumor size. Collectively, we identified and confirmed a novel "YTHDF1-m(6)A-cyclin B1 translation" axis as an essential molecular pathway for the prognosis of KRAS/TP53-mut LUAD.

TI Canonising Shakespeare in 1920s Japan Tsubouchi Shoyo and the

SO CRITICAL SURVEY
AB In 1927, just before completing the first Japanese translation of Shakespeare's Complete Works, Tsubouchi Shoyo (1859-1935) selected eight of his translations for inclusion in his own Selected Works, which were published in fifteen volumes in conclusion to his career as one of the leading exponents of cultural reform of his generation. His choice is idiosyncratic as it omits the plays that had become most popular during the period of Shakespeare's initial reception in late nineteenth-century Japan, but includes a number that were relatively unknown, such as Measure for Measure. This article suggests likely reasons for his selection before discussing the comments he makes on each play in his translation prefaces, and thus provides an overview of what Tsubouchi had come to value about Shakespeare.

TI Tissue- and development-stage-specific mRNA and heterogeneous CNV
   signatures of human ribosomal proteins in normal and cancer samples
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB We give results from a detailed analysis of human Ribosomal Protein (RP) levels in normal and cancer samples and cell lines from large mRNA, copy number variation and ribosome profiling datasets. After normalizing total RP mRNA levels per sample, we find highly consistent tissue specific RP mRNA signatures in normal and tumor samples. Multiple RP mRNA-subtypes exist in several cancers, with significant survival and genomic differences. Some RP mRNA variations among subtypes correlate with copy number loss of RP genes. In kidney cancer, RP subtypes map to molecular subtypes related to cell-of-origin. Pan-cancer analysis of TCGA data showed widespread single/double copy loss of RP genes, without significantly affecting survival. In several cancer cell lines, CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of RP genes did not affect cell viability. Matched RP ribosome profiling and mRNA data in humans and rodents stratified by tissue and development stage and were strongly correlated, showing that RP translation rates were proportional to mRNA levels. In a small dataset of human adult and fetal tissues, RP protein levels showed development stage and tissue specific heterogeneity of RP levels. Our results suggest that heterogeneous RP levels play a significant functional role in cellular physiology, in both normal and disease states.

TI Revealing stage-specific expression patterns of long noncoding RNAs
   along mouse spermatogenesis
SO RNA BIOLOGY
AB The discovery of a large number of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and the finding that they may play key roles in different biological processes, have started to provide a new perspective in the understanding of gene regulation. It has been shown that the testes express the highest amount of lncRNAs among different vertebrate tissues. However, although some studies have addressed the characterization of lncRNAs along spermatogenesis, an exhaustive analysis of the differential expression of lncRNAs at its different stages is still lacking. Here, we present the results for lncRNA transcriptome profiling along mouse spermatogenesis, employing highly pure flow sorted spermatogenic stage-specific cell populations, strand-specific RNAseq, and a combination of up-to-date bioinformatic pipelines for analysis. We found that the vast majority of testicular lncRNA genes are expressed at post-meiotic stages (i.e. spermiogenesis), which are characterized by extensive post-transcriptional regulation. LncRNAs at different spermatogenic stages shared common traits in terms of transcript length, exon number, and biotypes. Most lncRNAs were lincRNAs, followed by a high representation of antisense (AS) lncRNAs. Co-expression analyses showed a high correlation along the different spermatogenic stage transitions between the expression patterns of AS lncRNAs and their overlapping protein-coding genes, raising possible clues about lncRNA-related regulatory mechanisms. Interestingly, we observed the co-localization of an AS lncRNA and its host sense mRNA in the chromatoid body, a round spermatids-specific organelle that has been proposed as a reservoir of RNA-related regulatory machinery. An additional, intriguing observation is the almost complete lack of detectable expression for Y-linked testicular lncRNAs, despite that a high number of lncRNA genes are annotated for this chromosome.

TI Mapping Melodrama: Global Theatrical Circuits, Parsi Theater, and the
   Rise of the Social
SO BIOSCOPE-SOUTH ASIAN SCREEN STUDIES
AB This essay documents the transnational circulation of Victorian domestic melodrama and its adaptation to Indian theatrical practice, through the example of The Colleen Bawn, one of Dion Boucicault's most successful works. Using the historical South Asian newspaper archives, the study traces the introduction of melodrama and modern stagecraft into India via the Lewis Company, an enterprising Anglo-Australian family troupe. The drama's performance history and reception are charted as it traveled from Calcutta to Simla and Bombay. Its subsequent translation and reworking in the Parsi theater, in the form of Bholi Jan, the Gujarati-language version authored by K.N. Kabraji, reveal the highly productive role of melodrama in the South Asian environment. From melodrama developed the "social", a distinct genre centered on women, the family, and the tensions of modernity. Domestic melodrama's shape and meaning were thus recast in the new location, leaving a legacy of great importance to the evolution of modern theater and cinema in Indian languages.

It first explores to what degree the translations are determined by extratextual factors, such as the cultural and social climate of the times and the publication strategies. The second part, building upon previous literature on the translation of Ibsen into English, draws attention to the nuances and styles of the language in the original text and examines how they are tackled in these Chinese translations. Whenever it is possible, potential solutions to specific translation problems are suggested. In addition to providing a springboard for future Chinese translators of A Doll House, this paper aims to demonstrate Ibsen's dramatic art, which is much imbedded in his distinctive use of the vernacular language.

TI RACK1 Regulates Poxvirus Protein Synthesis Independently of Its Role in
   Ribosome-Based Stress Signaling
SO JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
AB Receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) is a multifunctional ribosomal protein that regulates translation directly and mediates signaling to and from the ribosome. While recent work has shown that RACK1 is phosphorylated by vaccinia virus (VacV) to stimulate translation of postreplicative viral mRNAs, whether RACK1 also contributes to VacV replication through its roles in ribosome-based stress signaling remains unclear.
   Receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) is a small ribosomal subunit protein that is phosphorylated by vaccinia virus (VacV) to maximize translation of postreplicative (PR) mRNAs that harbor 5 ' polyA leaders. However, RACK1 is a multifunctional protein that both controls translation directly and acts as a scaffold for signaling to and from the ribosome. This includes stress signaling that is activated by ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) and ribotoxic stress response (RSR) pathways. As VacV infection activates RQC and stress signaling, whether RACK1 influences viral protein synthesis through its effects on translation, signaling, or both remains unclear. Examining the effects of genetic knockout of RACK1 on the phosphorylation of key mitogenic and stress-related kinases, we reveal that loss of RACK1 specifically blunts the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) at late stages of infection. However, RACK1 was not required for JNK recruitment to ribosomes, and unlike RACK1 knockout, JNK inhibitors had no effect on viral protein synthesis. Moreover, reduced JNK activity during infection in RACK1 knockout cells contrasted with the absolute requirement for RACK1 in RSR-induced JNK phosphorylation. Comparing the effects of RACK1 knockout alongside inhibitors of late stage replication, our data suggest that JNK activation is only indirectly affected by the absence of RACK1 due to reduced viral protein accumulation. Cumulatively, our findings in the context of infection add further support for a model whereby RACK1 plays a specific and direct role in controlling translation of PR viral mRNAs that is independent of its role in ribosome-based stress signaling. IMPORTANCE Receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) is a multifunctional ribosomal protein that regulates translation directly and mediates signaling to and from the ribosome. While recent work has shown that RACK1 is phosphorylated by vaccinia virus (VacV) to stimulate translation of postreplicative viral mRNAs, whether RACK1 also contributes to VacV replication through its roles in ribosome-based stress signaling remains unclear. Here, we characterize the role of RACK1 in infected cells. In doing so, we find that RACK1 is essential for stress signal activation by ribotoxic stress responses but not by VacV infection. Moreover, although the loss of RACK1 reduces the level of stress-associated JNK activation in infected cells, this is an indirect consequence of RACK1's specific requirement for the synthesis of postreplicative viral proteins, the accumulation of which determines the level of cellular stress. Our findings reveal both the specific role of RACK1 and the complex downstream effects of its control of viral protein synthesis in the context of infection.

TI Regulation of Plasmodium yoelii Oocyst Development by Strain- and
   Stage-Specific Small-Subunit rRNA
SO MBIO
AB One unique feature of malaria parasites is the differential transcription of structurally distinct rRNA (rRNA) genes at different developmental stages: the A-type genes are transcribed mainly in asexual stages, whereas the S-type genes are expressed mostly in sexual or mosquito stages. Conclusive functional evidence of different rRNAs in regulating stage-specific parasite development, however, is still absent. Here we performed genetic crosses of Plasmodium yoelii parasites with one parent having an oocyst development defect (ODD) phenotype and another producing normal oocysts to identify the gene(s) contributing to the ODD. The parent with ODD-characterized as having small oocysts and lacking infective sporozoites-was obtained after introduction of a plasmid with a green fluorescent protein gene into the parasite genome and subsequent passages in mice. Quantitative trait locus analysis of genome-wide microsatellite genotypes of 48 progeny from the crosses linked an similar to 200-kb segment on chromosome 6 containing one of the S-type genes (D-type small subunit rRNA gene [D-ssu]) to the ODD. Fine mapping of the plasmid integration site, gene expression pattern, and gene knockout experiments demonstrated that disruption of the D-ssu gene caused the ODD phenotype. Interestingly, introduction of the D-ssu gene into the same parasite strain (self), but not into a different subspecies, significantly affected or completely ablated oocyst development, suggesting a stage-and subspecies (strain)-specific regulation of oocyst development by D-ssu. This study demonstrates that P. yoelii D-ssu is essential for normal oocyst and sporozoite development and that variation in the D-ssu sequence can have dramatic effects on parasite development.
   IMPORTANCE Malaria parasites are the only known organisms that express structurally distinct rRNA genes at different developmental stages. The differential expression of these genes suggests that they play unique roles during the complex life cycle of the parasites. Conclusive functional proof of different rRNAs in regulating parasite development, however, is still absent or controversial. Here we functionally demonstrate for the first time that a stage-specifically expressed D-type small-subunit rRNA gene (D-ssu) is essential for oocyst development of the malaria parasite Plasmodium yoelii in the mosquito. This study also shows that variations in D-ssu sequence and/or the timing of transcription may have profound effects on parasite oocyst development. The results show that in addition to protein translation, rRNAs of malaria parasites also regulate parasite development and differentiation in a strain-specific manner, which can be explored for controlling parasite transmission.

TI Small studies, big decisions: the role of pilot/feasibility studies in
   incremental science and premature scale-up of behavioral interventions
SO PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES
AB Background: Careful consideration and planning are required to establish "sufficient" evidence to ensure an investment in a larger, more well-powered behavioral intervention trial is worthwhile. In the behavioral sciences, this process typically occurs where smaller-scale studies inform larger-scale trials. Believing that one can do the same things and expect the same outcomes in a larger-scale trial that were done in a smaller-scale preliminary study (i.e., pilot/feasibility) is wishful thinking, yet common practice. Starting small makes sense, but small studies come with big decisions that can influence the usefulness of the evidence designed to inform decisions about moving forward with a larger-scale trial. The purpose of this commentary is to discuss what may constitute sufficient evidence for moving forward to a definitive trial. The discussion focuses on challenges often encountered when conducting pilot/feasibility studies, referred to as common (mis)steps, that can lead to inflated estimates of both feasibility and efficacy, and how the intentional design and execution of one or more, often small, pilot/feasibility studies can play a central role in developing an intervention that scales beyond a highly localized context.
   Main body: Establishing sufficient evidence to support larger-scale, definitive trials, from smaller studies, is complicated. For any given behavioral intervention, the type and amount of evidence necessary to be deemed sufficient is inherently variable and can range anywhere from qualitative interviews of individuals representative of the target population to a small-scale randomized trial that mimics the anticipated larger-scale trial. Major challenges and common (mis)steps in the execution of pilot/feasibility studies discussed are those focused on selecting the right sample size, issues with scaling, adaptations and their influence on the preliminary feasibility and efficacy estimates observed, as well as the growing pains of progressing from small to large samples. Finally, funding and resource constraints for conducting informative pilot/feasibility study(ies) are discussed.
   Conclusion: Sufficient evidence to scale will always remain in the eye of the beholder. An understanding of how to design informative small pilot/feasibility studies can assist in speeding up incremental science (where everything needs to be piloted) while slowing down premature scale-up (where any evidence is sufficient for scaling).

TI Circular RNA-protein interactions: functions, mechanisms, and
   identification
SO THERANOSTICS
AB Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are covalently closed, endogenous RNAs with no 5' end caps or 3' poly(A) tails. These RNAs are expressed in tissue-specific, cell-specific, and developmental stage-specific patterns. The biogenesis of circRNAs is now known to be regulated by multiple specific factors; however, circRNAs were previously thought to be insignificant byproducts of splicing errors. Recent studies have demonstrated their activity as microRNA (miRNA) sponges as well as protein sponges, decoys, scaffolds, and recruiters, and some circRNAs even act as translation templates in multiple pathophysiological processes. CircRNAs bind and sequester specific proteins to appropriate subcellular positions, and they participate in modulating certain protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions. Conversely, several proteins play an indispensable role in the life cycle of circRNAs from biogenesis to degradation. However, the exact mechanisms of these interactions between proteins and circRNAs remain unknown. Here, we review the current knowledge regarding circRNA-protein interactions and the methods used to identify and characterize these interactions. We also summarize new insights into the potential mechanisms underlying these interactions.

TI Dictionary (noun) - A Revolutionary Act or Performance: Socio-Political
   Lessons from China on the Power and (Un)Translatability of Words
SO COMPARATIVE CRITICAL STUDIES
AB Three recent texts emerging from distinct parts of China, all 'dictionaries' of sorts, each serve as a marker of the revolutionary potential of translation within their own contexts, but also as a marker of the limitations to translating the politics of translation to a world reader. At a moment when the Han-centric CCP (Chinese Communist Party) is reducing regional autonomy and forcing citizens into re-education camps, questions of language use and (un)translatability can have immediate and concrete consequences. The official and unofficial multiplicity of Chinese conceptions of ethnicity and nationality provide a necessary background for an understanding of the severity of the consequences of translation in the contemporary contexts. Likewise, a history of the dictionary in China provides insights as to why the dictionary form has been adopted to varying degrees by multiple contemporary texts. The parallax created between the Chinese contexts and world contexts of these texts, however, serves as a stark reminder of the potential bounds of the world literature paradigm.

TI PRMT5 regulates ovarian follicle development by facilitating Wt1
   translation
SO ELIFE
AB Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (Prmt5) is the major type II enzyme responsible for symmetric dimethylation of arginine. Here, we found that PRMT5 was expressed at high level in ovarian granulosa cells of growing follicles. Inactivation of Prmt5 in granulosa cells resulted in aberrant follicle development and female infertility. In Prmt5-knockout mice, follicle development was arrested with disorganized granulosa cells in which WT1 expression was dramatically reduced and the expression of steroidogenesis-related genes was significantly increased. The premature differentiated granulosa cells were detached from oocytes and follicle structure was disrupted. Mechanism studies revealed that Wt1 expression was regulated by PRMT5 at the protein level. PRMT5 facilitated IRES-dependent translation of Wt1 mRNA by methylating HnRNPA1. Moreover, the upregulation of steroidogenic genes in Prmt5-deficient granulosa cells was repressed by Wt1 overexpression. These results demonstrate that PRMT5 participates in granulosa cell lineage maintenance by inducing Wt1 expression. Our study uncovers a new role of post-translational arginine methylation in granulosa cell differentiation and follicle development.
   eLife digest Infertility in women can be caused by many factors, such as defects in the ovaries. An important part of the ovaries for fertility are internal structures called follicles, which house early forms of egg cells. A follicle grows and develops until the egg is finally released from the ovary into the fallopian tube, where the egg can then be fertilised. In the follicle, an egg is surrounded by other types of cells, such as granulosa cells. The egg and neighbouring cells must maintain healthy contacts with each other, otherwise the follicle can stop growing and developing, potentially causing infertility. The development of a follicle depends on an array of proteins. For example, the transcription factor WT1 controls protein levels by activating other genes and their proteins and is produced in high numbers by granulosa cells at the beginning of follicle development. Although WT1 levels dip towards the later stages of follicle development, insufficient levels can lead to defects. So far, it has been unclear how levels of WT1in granulose cells are regulated. Chen, Dong et al. studied mouse follicles to reveal more about the role of WT1 in follicle development. The researchers measured protein levels in mouse granulosa cells as the follicles developed, and discovered elevated levels of PRMT5, a protein needed for egg cells to form and survive in the follicles. Blocking granulosa cells from producing PRMT5 led to abnormal follicles and infertility in mice. Moreover, mice that had been engineered to lack PRMT5 developed abnormal follicles, where the egg and surrounding granulosa cells were not attached to each other, and the granulosa cells had low levels of WT1. Further experiments revealed that PRMT5 controlled WT1 levels by adding small molecules called methyl groups to another regulatory protein called HnRNPA1. The addition of methyl groups to genes or their proteins is an important modification that takes place in many processes within a cell. Chen, Dong et al. reveal that this activity also plays a key role in maintaining healthy follicle development in mice, and that PRMT5 is necessary for controlling WT1. Identifying all of the intricate mechanism involved in regulating follicle development is important for finding ways to combat infertility.

TI HIF-1 alpha-induced expression of m6A reader YTHDF1 drives
   hypoxia-induced autophagy and malignancy of hepatocellular carcinoma by
   promoting ATG2A and ATG14 translation
SO SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION AND TARGETED THERAPY
AB N6-methyladenosine (m6A), and its reader protein YTHDF1, play a pivotal role in human tumorigenesis by affecting nearly every stage of RNA metabolism. Autophagy activation is one of the ways by which cancer cells survive hypoxia. However, the possible involvement of m6A modification of mRNA in hypoxia-induced autophagy was unexplored in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, specific variations in YTHDF1 expression were detected in YTHDF1-overexpressing, -knockout, and -knockdown HCC cells, HCC organoids, and HCC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) murine models. YTHDF1 expression and hypoxia-induced autophagy were significantly correlated in vitro; significant overexpression of YTHDF1 in HCC tissues was associated with poor prognosis. Multivariate cox regression analysis identified YTHDF1 expression as an independent prognostic factor in patients with HCC. Multiple HCC models confirmed that YTHDF1 deficiency inhibited HCC autophagy, growth, and metastasis. Luciferase reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that HIF-1 alpha regulated YTHDF1 transcription by directly binding to its promoter region under hypoxia. The results of methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing, proteomics, and polysome profiling indicated that YTHDF1 contributed to the translation of autophagy-related genes ATG2A and ATG14 by binding to m6A-modified ATG2A and ATG14 mRNA, thus facilitating autophagy and autophagy-related malignancy of HCC. Taken together, HIF-1 alpha-induced YTHDF1 expression was associated with hypoxia-induced autophagy and autophagy-related HCC progression via promoting translation of autophagy-related genes ATG2A and ATG14 in a m6A-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that YTHDF1 is a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for patients with HCC.

   a Coppee's play: a comparative reading of Fi sabil al-taj and Pour La
   Couronne
SO MIDDLE EASTERN LITERATURES
AB This article discusses the ways in which Mu?tafa Lutfi al-Manfaluti rewrote Francois Coppee's Pour la Couronne (1895) in the shape of the novel, Fi sabil al-taj (1920). Al-Manfaluti turns a French drama into an Egyptian epic rather than simply introducing a piece of foreign literature by means of translation, so as to spread his call against imperialism and anti-colonialism and his program for fashioning an Egyptian national in the frame of 1919 Revolution. Whereas the author preserves all of the main events and traits of the original story, through commentary and word selection in his translation he orientates a new interpretation of the text. The article suggests that translation in the Nah?a cannot be seen only as acculturation but, in line with Venuti and Reynolds, should be considered as a new text that expresses the agency of the translators and their cultural environment.

AB This article calls attention to a classically inspired paratextual narrative of recusatio that unfolds across three poems ("The Authour here declareth the cause why hee wrote these Histories, and forewent the translation of the learned Poet Lucan," "The Authors Epilogue," and "The Authors excuse for writing these and other fancies, with promise of grauer matter hereafter") in George Turberville's Tragicall Tales of ca. 1574. The conspicuously Ovidian authorial self-portrait that Turberville constructs for himself in this volume's intertextually rich narrative frame arguably represents one of the most sophisticated adaptations of the Amores to have been produced in sixteenth-century England. More than this, however, it also functions as a significant piece of early modern literary criticism. Turberville's focus on matters of genre and style in this triad of poems ultimately reveals much about how the tragic and elegiac modes-and the tensions between them-were conceived in the mid-Tudor period.

TI Three "Erl-Kings"
SO IMAGOLOGIYA I KOMPARATIVISTIKA-IMAGOLOGY AND COMPARATIVE STUDIES
AB The scholars of Russian literature are very well aware of V. Zhukovsky's translation of Goethe's "Erlkonig" (1782), published as "Lesnoy tsar' " (1818). However, none of the studies of Zhukovsky's literary works mentions that Zhukovsky presumably used the English variant of the ballad by W. Scott for his translation of "Lesnoy tsar' ". W. Scott's "The Erl-King" (1797) was written fifteen years after the original and almost twenty years before Zhukovsky's translation. Thus, it can be assumed that V. Zhukovsky, who was acquainted with W. Scott's, couldn't ignore the English translation of "Erlkonig". If we compare V. Zhukovsky's and W. Scott's tranlsations in terms of their closeness to the original, we can see that the former is significantly far from the original than the latter. Zhukovsky is faithful to the original in terms of the content, but he completely abandons the folklore stylistics of the original and traditionally organizes his text according to the ballad principles, which have already been developed in his original works. However, in his evolution, V. Zhukovsky follows W. Scott and draws on not only W. Scott's early ballads but also his later narrative poems. By the moment when V. Zhukovsky starts translating Goethe's ballad, he must have been acquainted with W. Scott's narrative poems and other poetical pieces, which results in a difference between the original, English, and Russian translations. The closeness of Zhukovsky's and Scott's translation strategies can be seen not only on the level of content but also on the stylistic level. When creating "The Erl-King", W. Scott focuses on the literary form of the ballad: even though his translation is quite close to the original, he transforms the poetical semantics and ballad form in the vein of sentimentalism, which can be also seen in his translation of Burger's "Lenore". The comparative analyses of the original and two translations by Zhukovsky and Scott allows making a conclusion that W. Scott's translation of "Erlkonig" can be "interposed" between Goethe's text, which is close to folklore ballad traditions, and Zhukovsky's literary variant. If we take into account the undeniable fact that V. Zhukovsky looked to W. Scott's ballads, we can say that early W. Scott's literary pieces vector Zhukovsky's translational creative works and play the role of a transition stage for Zhukovsky's development as a poet and translator. It should be noted then, that later W. Scott returns to folklore variants of the ballad, while Zhukovsky remains faithful to the previously developed course to create his own philosophy of the genre.

TI The Introduction to Mohammad-Taqi Bahar's Sabkshenasi: A Translation
SO JOURNAL OF PERSIANATE STUDIES
AB Mohammad-Taqi Bahar's 1942 textbook Sabkshenasi ("Stylistics") was a landmark text in modern Persian literary studies. It coined terms (like sabk-e Hendi or the "Indian style" of Persian poetry) and laid out a tripartite, geographical-temporal model for the history of Persian poetry which largely remain dominant today. Bahar's articulation of a national canon of Iranian literature (comprising writings in various stages of the Persian language as well as Arabic) made Sabkshenasi an important text not only for the nascent department of Persian literature at the University of Tehran for which it was written, but for twentieth-century Iranian nationalism in general. By combin-ing traditional forms of knowledge with the methodologies pioneered by European Orientalists, it played an important role in modernizing Persian literary studies. The influential introduction to Sabkshenasi is translated here into English in full for the first time, along with a preface explaining the work's importance for Persian literary studies.

TI Synchrony in the voice-over of Polish fiction genres
SO BABEL-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE LA TRADUCTION-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF
   TRANSLATION
AB The increasing popularity of audiovisual translation in recent years has contributed to a better understanding of the audiovisual world. Nevertheless, some modalities such as voice-over have not received thorough attention. In Poland, where voice-over is the prevailing audiovisual, one voice talent reads out the entire dialogue list in a monotonous way. The translated version is subject to time and space restrictions, and both the original and the translated soundtracks are audible at the same time, making it interesting to analyze a key aspect of voice-over: the process of synchronization. Departing from a categorization which originated within the field of dubbing, and which was later extended and applied to the voice-over of non-fictional products by Franco, Matamala and Orero, this article aims to assess whether voice-over isochrony, literal synchrony, kinetic synchrony and action synchrony are maintained in the voice-over of fiction genres in Poland, and if so, what strategies are used to achieve this. The corpus is made up of four 15-minutes samples from movies belonging to four different genres: a comedy (Whatever Works, directed by Woody Allen 2009), a drama (Marvin's Room, directed by Jerry Zaks 1996), an action movie (Spy Game, directed by Tony Scott 2001), and a musical (Nine, directed by Rob Marshall 2009). The study highlights the specificities of synchrony in fictional movies and opens the door for future research into this previously underestimated audiovisual transfer mode.

Lessing's praise for John Banks' The Unhappy Favourite, or The Earl of Essex (1682) inspired a series of German-language translations and adaptations, including plays written for the Hofburgtheater in Vienna by Matthaus von Collin (1823) and by Heinrich Laube (1856).

TI Finding your tongue as cook and playwright: the case of Ryk Hattingh's
   Eensnaar
SO TRANSLATOR
AB Although food has become an object of study in various disciplines, the use of victuals in live theatre is still a neglected field. South African and New Zealand playwright Ryk Hattingh's homage to poet, doctor and Cape cookery expert C. Louis Leipoldt, a one-man play entitled Eensnaar, was staged by director Mark Graham as a cooking session providing a sensorial response to considerations of cultural and linguistic identity. The play centres round a recipe for beef tongue and the culinary implications of preparing traditional dishes outside their country of origin. The dish also exemplifies the expatriate author's sense of loss of language and a sense of community. The play contains minimal stage directions and no invitation to cook on stage, but Graham's olfactory emphasis is evocative of Leipoldt's parallel career as a writer on food under the nom de plume K.A.R. Bonade (carbonnade or char-grilled meat). Leipoldt was instrumental in forging the Afrikaans language, as illustrated by various quotes from his best-known poems. Hattingh's play contains a number of intertextual references in English and quotations from Moriori incantations translated into Afrikaans. Starting with its title, Eensnaar, this multilingual play written in a minority language and consisting largely of quotations from anthologies and traditional recipe books, might just be untranslatable, a homage not to a poet, but to a language, an intimate letter from playwright to public.

TI Role of RNA-binding proteins during the late stages of Flavivirus
   replication cycle
SO VIROLOGY JOURNAL
AB The genus Flavivirus encompasses several worldwide-distributed arthropod-borne viruses including, dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus, Zika virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus. Infection with these viruses manifest with symptoms ranging from febrile illness to life- threatening hypotensive shock and encephalitis. Therefore, flaviviruses pose a great risk to public health. Currently, preventive measures are falling short to control epidemics and there are no antivirals against any Flavivirus. Flaviviruses carry a single stranded positive-sense RNA genome that plays multiple roles in infected cells: it is translated into viral proteins, used as template for genome replication, it is the precursor of the subgenomic flaviviral RNA and it is assembled into new virions. Furthermore, viral RNA genomes are also packaged into extracellular vesicles, e.g. exosomes, which represent an alternate mode of virus dissemination. Because RNA molecules are at the center of Flavivirus replication cycle, viral and host RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are critical determinants of infection. Numerous studies have revealed the function of RBPs during Flavivirus infection, particularly at the level of RNA translation and replication. These proteins, however, are also critical participants at the late stages of the replication cycle. Here we revise the function of host RBPs and the viral proteins capsid, NS2A and NS3, during the packaging of viral RNA and the assembly of new virus particles. Furthermore, we go through the evidence pointing towards the importance of host RBPs in mediating cellular RNA export with the idea that the biogenesis of exosomes harboring Flavivirus RNA would follow an analogous pathway.

TI Integrated analysis of competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks in
   subacute stage of spinal cord injury
SO GENE
AB This study aims to investigate the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of subacute stage of spinal cord injury (SCI). Gene-expression datasets associated with SCI were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and differential expression analyses were performed in order to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Multiple network types were constructed and analyzed, including protein protein-interaction (PPI) network, miRNA-target network, lncRNA-associated competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network, and miRNA-transcription factor (TF)-target network. Cluster analyses were performed to identify significant modules. To verify the prediction accuracy of the in-silico identified molecules, qRT-PCR experiments were conducted. The results depicted the Ywhae gene as the hub gene with the highest degree in the PPI network. The ceRNA network identified specific genes (Flna, ID3, and HK2), miRNAs (miR-16-5p, miR-1958, and miR-185-5p), and lncRNAs (Neat1, Xist, and Malat1) as playing critical regulating roles in the pathological mechanisms of SCI. The miRNA-TF-gene interaction network identified four important TFs (Sp1, Trp53, Jun, and Rela). The miRNA-gene-TF interaction loops from the significant modules indicated that miR-325-3p can interact with the Asah1 gene and TF-Sp1 by forming a closed loop. The qRT-PCR experiments verified four selected genes (Firm, ID3, HK2, and Ywhae) and two selected TFs (Jun, and Sp1) as significantly up-regulated following SCI. The results indicated that four genes (Flna, ID3, HK2, and Ywhae), four transcription factors (Sp1, Trp53, Jun, and RelA), two miRNAs (miR-16-5p and miR-325-3p), and three lncRNAs (Neat1, Xist, and Malat1) are likely to be involved in the molecular mechanisms underlying the subacute stage of SO. These findings uncover putative pathogenic mechanisms involved in SCI and might bear translation significance for future research towards therapeutic development.

TI Methyltransferase 3 Mediated miRNA m6A Methylation Promotes Stress
   Granule Formation in the Early Stage of Acute Ischemic Stroke
SO FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR NEUROSCIENCE
AB The modification of methyltransferase-like (METTL) enzymes plays important roles in various cellular responses by regulating microRNA expression. However, how m6A modification is involved in stress granule (SG) formation in the early stage of acute ischemic stroke by affecting the biogenesis processing of microRNAs remains unclear. Here, we established a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model in rats and an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) model in primary cortical neurons and PC12 cells to explore the potential mechanism between m6A modification and SG formation. Thein vivoresults showed that the level of infarction and apoptosis increased while SG formation decreased significantly within the ischemic cortex with improved reperfusion time after 2 h of ischemia. Consistent with thein vivodata, an inverse association between the apoptosis level and SG formation was observed in PC12 cells during the reperfusion period after 6 h of OGD stimulation. Bothin vivoandin vitroresults showed that the expression of METTL3 protein, m6A and miR-335 was significantly decreased with the reperfusion period. Overexpression of the METTL3 and METTL3 gene-knockdown in PC12 cells were achieved via plasmid transfection and CRISPR-Cas9 technology, respectively. Overexpression or knockdown of METTL3 in oxygen-glucose deprivation of PC12 cells resulted in functional maturation of miR-335, SG formation and apoptosis levels. In addition, we found that miR-335 enhanced SG formation through degradation of the mRNA of the eukaryotic translation termination factor (Erf1). In conclusion, we found that METTL3-mediated m6A methylation increases the maturation of miR-335, which promotes SG formation and reduces the apoptosis level of injury neurons and cells, and provides a potential therapeutic strategy for AIS.

TI Development Remix: Representing Poverty, Culture, and Agency in the
   Developing World
SO INTERNATIONAL STUDIES PERSPECTIVES
AB The development remix, a project initiated at Georgetown University, is a six-to eight-minute-long digital narrative that mixes or edits existing literary or audiovisual representations. The remix project enables development students, scholars, and practitioners to prepare their own narratives about the developing world, through experiencing existing narratives closely, and makes them empathic and critical while humanizing the cultural conditions of poverty in the developing world. The digital remix also actively engages scholars and practitioners with audiovisual representations, rather than as silent observers or readers of fictional texts and visual dramas. After a brief conceptualization on circulation of narratives about the developing world, the article presents the remix technique for the development scholar. The remix is, in effect, a translation with several strengths: it foregrounds the remixer's reflexivity, humanizes the conditions in the developing world, locates voice and agency in development narratives, and presents all narratives as culturally hybrid. These issues have been the subject of not just development research but also social sciences in general, especially on the use of films and fiction in pedagogic practices. Therefore, the usefulness of preparing remixed narratives extends beyond international development studies.

TI Tempering Feydeau: Twisting and Guilty Pleasures on the London Stage
   (1893-1897)
SO CAHIERS VICTORIENS & EDOUARDIENS
AB Beginning in 1892, Feydeau established himself in France as the new master of vaudeville comedy. London theatres surrendered to his infectious laughter, producing a number of his plays between 1892 and 1897, though admittedly, carefully selected: The Sportsman, adapted from Monsieur chasse ! , The Other Man from Champignol malgre lui, His Little Dodge (Le Systeme Ribadier), A Night Out (L'Hotel du Libre-Echange) and A Night Session (Seance de nuit). By reviewing the manuscripts submitted to the Office of the Lord Chamberlain, our article proposes to examine the approaches that made it possible for London directors and producers to edit light comedies which, with the name Feydeau, boasted of their French origin and frivolous nature, even when this choice carried inevitable risks. How could they avoid offending a Lord Chamberlain, hostile to any signs of immorality, with these plays, which were often based on subversive and ribald comedy? In each case, the manuscripts submitted for his censorship, in the proposed texts, reveal a prior self-censorship, evident both in the choices of the plays presented, and in the contortions of the adapters and translators: transpositions of situations, cuts and line changes all aimed at smoothing over or toning down the comedic effects relating to sexuality, as well as to social divisions. Even the most faithful translations brought about a shift in the starting situation, profoundly changing Feydeau's reflections on intimate relationships and social ties. But why edit these plays, and deliberately run into such obstacles? Perhaps the dramatic and rhythmic inventiveness of Feydeau's plays was an irresistible attraction to both performers and the public, as the study of their reception reveals. Even when adapters were often compelled to reduce Feydeau's text, they also easily found the means to introduce clownish acts that were likely to please British audiences.

AB In 1818 Jose Joaquin de Mora adapts the French tragedy Ninus II, by Charles Brifaut, which had been premiered in Paris, on 19 April 1813, performed by the actor Francois-Joseph Talma in the Theatre Francais. The Spanish author prepared his version for the Teatro del Principe, where it was staged on 4 June 1818 by the actor Isidoro Maiquez. In the printed edition the translator asserts that major changes had been made in order to adapt the play to Spanish taste and to correct the original's weaknesses. In this paper I show the context of the translation and study Mora's version on three levels: stylistic, dramatic and political.

TI Prognostic significance of the expression of nuclear eukaryotic
   translation initiation factor 5A2 in human melanoma
SO ONCOLOGY LETTERS
AB Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A2 (EIF5A2) expression is upregulated in various cancers. The present authors previously demonstrated that cytoplasmic EIF5A2 expression increases with melanoma progression and inversely correlates with patient survival. Other studies have suggested that nuclear EIF5A2 may also play a role in oncogenesis. The present study used immunohistochemistry and tissue microarray with a large number of melanocytic lesions (n=459) and demonstrated that nuclear EIF5A2 expression was significantly upregulated between common acquired nevi, dysplastic nevi and primary melanomas, and between primary melanomas and metastatic melanomas. Nuclear EIF5A2 expression was inversely associated with overall and disease-specific 5-year survival rate for all (P<0.001) and primary (P=0.014 and P=0.015, respectively) melanoma patients. Nuclear EIF5A2 expression was directly associated with melanoma thickness (P=0.036) and American Joint Committee on Cancer staging (P<0.001), which suggests the possible role of nuclear EIF5A2 in melanoma cell invasion. Subsequently, the present study investigated the association between the expression of nuclear EIF5A2 and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), which is an important factor for promoting cancer cell invasion. Nuclear EIF5A2 and a strong MMP-2 expression were directly associated, and their concurrent expression was significantly associated with a poorer overall and disease-specific 5-year survival rate for all and primary melanoma patients. Nuclear and cytoplasmic EIF5A2 expression were also demonstrated to be significantly associated, and simultaneous expression of the two forms of EIF5A2 was significantly associated with poor overall and disease-specific 5-year survival rates for all and primary melanoma patients. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that nuclear EIF5A2 expression alone and in combination with cytoplasmic EIF5A2 expression was an adverse independent prognostic factor for all and primary melanoma patients. In conclusion, the present study for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, demonstrated that nuclear EIF5A2 expression is an independent prognostic marker in melanoma, and revealed its role in melanoma progression and patient survival. Therefore, nuclear EIF5A2 may have the potential to serve as a therapeutic marker for melanoma.

TI Canine Actors and Melodramatic Effects: &ITThe Dog of Montargis&IT
   Arrives on the English Stage
SO CAHIERS VICTORIENS & EDOUARDIENS
AB This work examines how, through the adaptation of the widely celebrated French canine melodrama Le chien de Montargis onto the British stage, Victorian society explored and attempted to define its own distinct cultural alliance and conceptualization of the dog. Based on a medieval legend, Le chien was originally written for the Parisian stage by Guilbert de Pixerecourt in 1814, and it immediately attracted the attention of English theatre businessmen. English adaptations soon followed, as translations from a variety of sources were presented before a public mesmerized by the feats of Dragon, the memorable canine character. From an anonymous translation to adaptations believed to have been the brainchild of William Barrymore and Thomas Dibdin, The Dog of Montargis was to be showcased throughout the greater part of the century. Such adaptations came at a highly significant moment in English history regarding the reconsideration of animality and domestic non-human others. As a result of scientific advancements and increasing sensibilities regarding 'cruel' behaviours, nineteenth-century England would witness the cultural impact of Darwinism, the reaction against continental experimental physiology (a field led principally by the French and the Germans), and the emergence of humane and animal protection societies. Within the complexity of this context, particularly as Victorian society consolidated itself in the latter part of the century, the production of a canine melodrama acquires a particular significance. This paper examines the choices made for the adaptations of the play and analyses how such aesthetic endeavours (affecting production, plot, and script, among other features) revealed a conception of the nonhuman other (in this case a species as significant as a dog) that reflected the shifting concerns on animality, their humane treatment, and their position within the overall pervasive sense of 'Englishness' and national sentiment. From an analysis of English adaptors' choice to keep the canine character alive (versus its tragic fate in the French version) to revisiting the character of Dragon through the lens of the domestic ethos of kindness, this paper explores fundamental issues related to Victorian ideals about dogs and their immersion within discourses revolving around loyalty, courage, breed, and capacity for mourning. In examining how the dog both contributes to melodramatic conventions and absorbs the growing social and scientific tensions relating to the definition of 'dog-hood', the research hopes to contribute to a better comprehension of the extent to which certain aspects of the performance (such as the dog's idiosyncratic form of communicating its feelings) represent key sites for the exploration of how modern conceptions of the non-human other were shaped.

TI Elongation factor-Tu can repetitively engage aminoacyl-tRNA within the
   ribosome during the proofreading stage of tRNA selection
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB The substrate for ribosomes actively engaged in protein synthesis is a ternary complex of elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA), and GTP. EF-Tu plays a critical role in mRNA decoding by increasing the rate and fidelity of aa-tRNA selection at each mRNA codon. Here, using three-color single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging and molecular dynamics simulations, we examine the timing and role of conformational events that mediate the release of aa-tRNA from EF-Tu and EF-Tu from the ribosome after GTP hydrolysis. Our investigations reveal that conformational changes in EF-Tu coordinate the rate-limiting passage of aa-tRNA through the accommodation corridor en route to the peptidyl transferase center of the large ribosomal subunit. Experiments using distinct inhibitors of the accommodation process further show that aa-tRNA must at least partially transit the accommodation corridor for EF-Tu center dot GDP to release. aa-tRNAs failing to undergo peptide bond formation at the end of accommodation corridor passage after EF-Tu release can be reengaged by EF-Tu center dot GTP from solution, coupled to GTP hydrolysis. These observations suggest that additional rounds of ternary complex formation can occur on the ribosome during proofreading, particularly when peptide bond formation is slow, which may serve to increase both the rate and fidelity of protein synthesis at the expense of GTP hydrolysis.

In the initial part of the essay we will overview Kott's influence in the development of current Shakespearean tradition(s) in Spain from the early 1970s to the present day. In fact, his writings and critical views on William Shakespeare's Works have been a decisive point in the development of new approaches to this playwright in some University Departments and Drama Schools in this country. The whole discussion will take the notion of hybrid and hybridization as the point of departure and we will draw some conclusions for discussing new critical thinking in Art (Science,) and Humanities.

TI Reunion, Complication, Refraction, and Translation: How Postcolonialism
   and Post-Structuralism Mark Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo
SO MODERN DRAMA
AB What has perplexed critics and audiences about Rajiv Joseph's Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo (2009) - its seemingly apolitical and ruminative second act - in fact signals why the play is rightful heir to an earlier generation of Broadway productions with postcolonial concerns. While plays such as David Henry Hwang's M. Butterfly were indebted to Edward Said's understanding of the orientalist binary of east/west, Joseph's play makes a post-structuralist turn midway through its plot, moving beyond familiar territory to offer pictures of intercultural conflict in the Iraq War. This conflict is complicated by the complexities of internal and cultural multiplicity and hybridity, as described in the writings of Homi Bhabha and Arjun Appadurai. Nevertheless, Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo simultaneously reflects a humanist desire for reunion and a fear of violent refraction, arguing that, in the confusingly heteroglossic arena of twenty-first-century global warfare, the work of translation offers some hope of social coherence.

TI Frequency Scale Translation in the MDCT Domain for AAC Decoder Algorithm
SO JOURNAL OF THE AUDIO ENGINEERING SOCIETY
AB Nowadays, mobile devices (smart phones and tablet PCs), and DMB (digital media broadcasting) systems can play music or movies with different pitches or tempos. In order to change the pitch or tempo of an audio signal, it is common to perform an algorithm after the decoder stage. An algorithm that can be used to change the pitch or tempo requires time-domain operations to be performed on the decoded audio signal. Since two audio algorithms are carried out in the processor and the system, such methods require several calculations and have high power consumption, making them inefficient. If changing the pitch or tempo of an audio signal is performed while the encoded audio signal is being decoded, it reduces the load on the processor as well as the system. In this paper we propose a modified AAC (advanced audio coding) decoder structure that can change the pitch and tempo of an audio signal.

TI Schnitzler in Britain: Authorship, Translation and Finding a Place at

SO AUSTRIAN STUDIES
AB For over sixty years Das weite Land [The Vast Domain, 1911] remained largely unknown in Britain. It was only with the production of Tom Stoppard's English `version' (Undiscovered Country, 1979) at the National Theatre that Schnitzler and this particular play were brought to the full attention of British audiences. Examination of the papers of Heinrich Schnitzler (in Vienna) and Tom Stoppard (in Texas) makes it possible to situate the production within a wider context of placing Schnitzler in Britain, while also illuminating Stoppard's process of adaptation. The material shows that what we see performed on stage is merely one iteration in a continuum of creative transfer back and forth between numerous individuals and texts.

TI Metaphorical dimension of idioms in TV series for German, Norwegian and
   Spanish audiences
SO ESTUDIOS DE TRADUCCION
AB Over recent years, internet TV series have grown in popularity to become one of the audiovisual products with the highest audiences worldwide. The Covid crisis, with limitations on movement, has further increased their success during 2020-21. English is by far the most common language for such productions, which are typically offered to non-anglophone viewers in translated format, with either subtitles or dubbing. One of the main challenges in translation here concerns the use of idioms, since these do not always have a fixed equivalent in the target language. Taking as a starting point a corpus of drama series from Netflix and Amazon Prime, this study considers the metaphorical dimension of idioms in original TV series in English and the subtitling of these in German, Norwegian and Spanish. The aim is to analyze the strategies used in the translation process, and to look at the differences between the original dialogues and the translated subtitles. The data are described from a cognitive and contrastive perspective, according to the methodology developed by the author. The results of the analysis show a general trend towards the reduction of metaphorical expressions in the translated subtitles. Significant differences are found between the translations into the three target languages under examination. A surprising finding is that there are more similarities between the German and Spanish translations than between those into German and Norwegian, despite these latter two belonging to the same Germanic linguistic family.

TI Back in the Republic of Conscience: Seamus Heaney's The Cure at Troy,
   its politics, ethics and aesthetics
SO TEXTUAL PRACTICE
AB For Seamus Heaney translation was by no means peripheral to his literary project, but central to it, not least as a means of renewing his creative impetus and extending the reach of his work across multiple times and cultures. This essay examines the reasons behind Heaney's increasing immersion in Greek literature from the mid-1980s onwards. It examines how the political and ethical issues Sophocles addresses in Philoctetes drew him to the play, and identifies the contexts - international and local - which shaped The Cure at Troy's composition and reception. Unlike many previous discussions which dwell primarily on material Heaney added to the original, this essay offers a meticulous analysis of the entire Cure. It evaluates the quality of its poetry and its relationship to Heaney's lyric work up to 1990 and after. A recurring focus of interest are those moments and extended passages where Heaney takes greatest pains to make the source text his own, to settle in and colonize' it. In demonstrating where, when and why divergences occur, his version is repeatedly compared and contrasted with those of four other eminent translators. What emerges from this is how fully he sought to re-imagine the characters and recast the Chorus, ensuring the audience's empathy for and engagement with these flawed specimens of humanity.

TI Swedish Whiteness, German Multiculturalism, French National Identity,
   and American Racial Profiling Transnational Perspectives on Jonas Hassen
   Khemi 's Invasion!
SO NORDIC THEATRE STUDIES
AB Populated by characters from the Middle East, North Africa, Southeast Asia, and Sweden, Jonas Hassen Khemiri's debut play, Invasion! (2006), marked one of the first intercultural theatrical events on a mainstream Swedish stage. It unapologetically confronted audiences with the consequences of stereotypical representations of Muslim men as fundamentalist terrorists and further criticized the notion of "Swedishness" for not just working as a mere designation of nationality and citizenship, but also a silent, yet powerful signifier of whiteness. Moreover, Invasion! was the first play to be performed in a mainstream theatre by a cast that had an intercultural and international background and could effortlessly switch between standard Swedish (rikssvenska) and suburban Swedish (ortensprak).
   Acknowledging the fifteenth anniversary of Invasion!, this article looks back upon the watershed of director Farnaz Arbabi's original production and the play's subsequent transnational impact. How did a play that was defiantly at odds with the hegemonic whiteness of the performing arts in Sweden, at that point in time, not only become a modern classic that found its way into the university curricula, but went on to garner an impressively transnational success? What exactly captured the interest and attention of theatre artists in Germany, France, the US, and many other countries? And how did international reviewers react to and interpret the work? What interests me specifically is to study how the play has 'travelled', how its characters and themes have migrated to different national and linguistic contexts, engendered new creative networks and transnational dialogues as well as unfolded multiple layers of cultural translations in the process. A genuine understanding and appreciation of Khemiri's work, I suggest, necessitates a transnational outlook that, in turn, sheds light on Nordic theatre and performance as increasingly intercultural and motivated by concerns that are not regional but global.

TI Origin and Role of a Subset of Tumor-Associated Neutrophils with
   Antigen-Presenting Cell Features in Early-Stage Human Lung Cancer
SO CANCER CELL
AB Based on studies in mouse tumor models, granulocytes appear to play a tumor-promoting role. However, there are limited data about the phenotype and function of tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) in humans. Here, we identify a subset of TANs that exhibited characteristics of both neutrophils and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in early-stage human lung cancer. These APC-like "hybrid neutrophils," which originate from CD11b(+)CD15(hi)CD10(-)CD16(low) immature progenitors, are able to cross-present antigens, as well as trigger and augment anti-tumor T cell responses. Interferon-g and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor are requisite factors in the tumor that, working through the Ikaros transcription factor, synergistically exert their APC-promoting effects on the progenitors. Overall, these data demonstrate the existence of a specialized TAN subset with anti-tumor capabilities in human cancer.

TI Lead compounds and key residues of ribosomal protein S1 in
   drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis
SO BIOORGANIC CHEMISTRY
AB Ribosomal protein S1 (RpsA) has been identified as a novel target of pyrazinoic acid (POA), which is the active form of pyrazinamide (PZA), in vivo. RpsA plays a crucial role in trans-translation, which is widespread in microbes. In our investigation, we first described the discovery of promising RpsA antagonists for drug-resistant mycobacterium (MtRpsAd438A) and M. smegmatis, as well as wild-type M. tuberculosis. These antagonists were discovered via structure/ligand-based virtual screening approaches. A total of 21 targeted compounds were selected by virtual screening, combined scores, affinity, similarities and rules for potential as drugs. Next, the affinities of these compounds for three targeted proteins were tested in vitro by applying various technologies, including fluorescence quenching titration (FQT), saturation transfer difference (STD), and chemical shift perturbation (CSP) assays. The results showed that seven compounds had a high affinity for the targeted proteins. Our discovery set the stage for discovering new chemical entities (NCEs) for PZA-resistant tuberculosis and providing key residues for rational drug design to target RpsA.

TI Polish literature in Siberian periodicals of the 1880-1910s
SO SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
AB Studying the foreign national literary traditions in the pre-revolutionary Siberian periodicals has a rich tradition owing to one of the scientific schools of the TSU Faculty of Philology. Literary translations, reviews on foreign authors' plays, critics of foreign literature in such periodicals as "Sibirskii listok", "Sibirskaya gazeta", "Sibirskii vestnik" are of scientific interest not only in terms of perception strategies, correlating with the receptive intentions of the Russian Centre, but also as an indicator of the regional cultural identity that has been formed due to the binary opposition of Self-Alien.
   The paper aims at displaying the most common research methods and strategies of the Polish literature perception in Siberian periodicals of the 1880-1910s. The data for the study is based on frontal review of more than 110 publications. The corpus of texts related to the reception of Polish verbal culture is 95 % composed of flash fiction and poetry translations. The majority of the texts go under the heading "Feuilleton" in "Sibirskaya zhizn" and "Sibirskii vestnik". About fifteen publications represent reviews on staging, critical and biographical features about Polish authors and their works. It is worth mentioning that such preference is specific itself, given the perception of French and German literature in the Siberian periodicals of the same period.
   The range of Polish authors, selected by Siberian translators and editors, adequately reflects the tendencies in the development of Polish literature at the turn of the century. The bibliography of translations consists of the works written by more than twenty contemporary authors. This research strategy could be named specific, compared with the perception of the German literature with its retrospective dominant. The first of the most popular genres in the local periodicals is flash fiction written by the representatives of Polish realism such as Boleslav Prus (1847-1912), Genrik Senkevich (1846-1916), Mariya Konopnitskaya (1842-1910), the young Stefan Zheromskii (1864-1925), Vladislav Reimont (1867-1925), Vladislav Orkan (1875-1930) etc. The main features of Polish realism legacy, in particular, its educational and didactic ("positivism") orientation, expressed in the predominance of the socio-ideological problems, on the one hand, and its genetic cognation with romanticism traditions, on the other hand, correlated with the regional program provided by oblastniki. This program was aimed at the development of subethnic cultural identity by means of enrichment of verbal culture and increasing the level of education of the population.
   The principal form of Polish literature reception in Siberian periodicals in late 1890s-early 1900s is translations. Hence the issue of the matter deals with the range of translators, among whom there are a few fundamental figures with their own publications. A. O. Stanislavskii (13 translations) and I. I. Pochekas (12 translations) published the largest number of translations from Polish to Russian. The comparison of their translation works allows comprehending the importance of the creative purposes and the personality of the subject of the foreign national regional reception and the reception of literary tendencies.
   The perception of Polish literature in pre-revolutionary Siberian periodicals is of interest in studying the verbal culture of the area, its subethnic self-consciousness absorbing trends that are alternative to those dictated by the Imperial Center. However, Russian-Polish dialogue, provided by journalists of the Siberian periodicals, deserves close attention itself as a precedent of resonance reception, typical for late 1890s-early 1900s. This period represents the special stage in the history of multicultural communication between two Slavic nations. This stage could be considered as the exceptional one comparing with others, much more thoroughly studied periods of Russian-Polish relations.

TI Yi Kwang-su's Gyuhan (Sorrows of the Inner Room): Korea's First Modern
   Play?
SO ASIAN THEATRE JOURNAL
AB Scholarly enquiry into the formation of modern drama on the Korean peninsula has given way to vibrant debate over the years. The enigma of the inception of modern drama continues to elicit diverging opinions regarding the first" modern Korean play. In 1916, writer, activist, and journalist Yi Kwang-su published his highly influential critical work "Munhak iran hao" (What is Literature?) whereby he stood out as an early figure to preach his views of drama as a modern literary genre, underscoring the vital role of theatre as a tool for modern progress with the potential to be more influential than the novel. Gyuhan (Sorrows of the Inner Room) was published the following year and the play can be interpreted as Yi's attempt to put his theory into practice. Despite Yi's prestige as an architect of Korea's modern literary world, Sorrows of the Inner Room remains obscure beyond Korean-speaking scholarship of drama. This introduction seeks to explore the play's modern significance while also providing the first full translation in English to bring Yi's work to a new audience.
   Owen Stampton (257503@soas.ac.uk ) is a doctoral researcher at the University of London, School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) working on Korean literature. His main research interests include modern and premodern poetry, modern drama, and literary criticism.

TI The Yellow Earth Becomes the Yellow Dragon: Eco-Consciousness in Chinese
   Theatre of the 1980s
SO ASIAN THEATRE JOURNAL
AB Amidst the political and cultural sea change of the 1980s in China, a refined awareness of the environmental bubbled to the surface. Throughout this decade, artists and scientists alike searched for ways to convey the urgency of China's ecological crisis. Playwrights who tackled this issue often looked to the past, rediscovering ecological models in Confucian and Daoist ethics as well as ancient myths and rites. This paper examines two such plays, The Sangshuping Chronicles (1988) and Gao Xingjian's Wild Man (1983), both of which offer fascinating possibilites for the development of a Chinese eco-poetics consonant with Una Chaudhuri's Western-based concept of eco-theatre.
   Heather Phillips is a PhD student in the Department of Drama and Dance at Tufts University. In November 2007, she cohosted the ASTR seminar "Ethics in Translation," and in May 2008 she cohosted a colloquium at Tufts on the translation of plays. This paper represents her first venture into the study of Chines theatre.

TI Oxidative damage of 18S and 5S ribosomal RNA in digestive gland of
   mussels exposed to trace metals
SO AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
AB Numerous studies have shown the ability of trace metals to accumulate in marine organisms and cause oxidative stress that leads to perturbations in many important intracellular processes, including protein synthesis. This study is mainly focused on the exploration of structural changes, like base modifications, scissions, and conformational changes, caused in 18S and 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) isolated from the mussel Mytilus gallopro-vincialis exposed to 40 mu g/L Cu, 30 mu g/L Hg, or 100 mu g/L Cd, for 5 or 15 days. 18S rRNA and 5S rRNA are components of the small and large ribosomal subunit, respectively, found in complex with ribosomal proteins, translation factors and other auxiliary components (metal ions, toxins etc). 18S rRNA plays crucial roles in all stages of protein synthesis, while 5S rRNA serves as a master signal transducer between several functional regions of 28S rRNA. Therefore, structural changes in these ribosomal constituents could affect the basic functions of ribosomes and hence the normal metabolism of cells. Especially, 18S rRNA along with ribosomal proteins forms the decoding centre that ensures the correct codon-anticodon pairing. As exemplified by ELISA, primer extension analysis and DMS footprinting analysis, each metal caused oxidative damage to rRNA, depending on the nature of metal ion and the duration of exposure. Interestingly, exposure of mussels to Cu or Hg caused structural alterations in 5S rRNA, localized in paired regions and within loops A, B, C, and E, leading to a continuous progressive loss of the 5S RNA structural integrity. In contrast, structural impairments of 5S rRNA in mussels exposed to Cd were accumulating for the initial 5 days, and then progressively decreased to almost the normal level by day 15, probably due to the parallel elevation of metallothionein content that depletes the pools of free Cd. Regions of interest in 18S rRNA, such as the decoding centre, sites implicated in the binding of tRNAs (A- and P-sites) or translation factors, and areas related to translation fidelity, were found to undergo significant metal-induced conformational alterations, leading either to loosening of their structure or to more compact folding. These modifications were associated with parallel alterations in the translation process at multiple levels, a fact suggesting that structural perturbations in ribosomes, caused by metals, pose significant hurdles in translational efficiency and fidelity.

TI SSBP1: A Potential Prognostic Marker of Lung Adenocarcinoma
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL REGULATORS AND HOMEOSTATIC AGENTS
AB Background: Single-stranded DNA-binding protein 1 (SSBP1) is pivotal to mitochondrial DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) replication, reintegration, and reconstruction. However, precisely how SSBP1 contributes to lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains unclear.
   Methods: In this bioinformatics study, raw datasets were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. SSBP1 expression was investigated using TCGA, GEO, GTEx, cBioPortal, TIMER2.0, and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis databases. SSBP1 expression in clinical specimens was determined using fluorescence-based reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical experiment.
   Results: As LUAD progressed, SSBP1 was drastically upregulated and closely associated with disease progression. To assess the prognostic and diagnostic value of SSBP1, the Kaplan-Meier plot, Cox proportional hazard model, and receiver operating characteristic curve methods were employed. SSBP1 reliably and accurately predicted and diagnosed LUAD. SSBP1 overexpression correlated with poor overall survivability, as well as T, N, and pathological stages. Simultaneously, based on gene set enrichment analyses, SSBP1-related genes were closely related to the mitochondrial translation pathway. Furthermore, SSBP1 expression positively correlated with the infiltration degrees of aDC (activated dendritic cells), Th2 (T helper2 cells), and Tgd (gammadelta T cells); By contrast, negative correlations were observed with the infiltration degrees of CD56 bright cells, mastocytes, macrophages, iDC (interstitial dendritic cells), eosinophils, DC (dendritic cells), CD8 T cells, B cells, Tcm (central memory T cells), Tem (effective memory cells), TFH (T follicular helper cells), Th17 cells (T helper 17 cells), pDC (plasmacytoid dendritic cells), and NK cells (natural killer cells).
   Conclusions: In summary, SSBP1 may play a central role in mitochondrial translation and can be regarded as a molecular target for predicting LUAD prognosis.

TI Identification of TIA1 mRNA targets during human neuronal development
SO MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTS
AB Background Neuronal development is a tightly controlled process involving multi-layered regulatory mechanisms. While transcriptional pathways regulating neurodevelopment are well characterized, post-transcriptional programs are still poorly understood. TIA1 is an RNA-binding protein that can regulate splicing, stability, or translation of target mRNAs, and has been shown to play critical roles in stress response and neurodevelopment. However, the identity of mRNAs regulated by TIA1 during neurodevelopment under unstressed conditions is still unknown. Methods and Results To identify the mRNAs targeted by TIA1 during the first stages of human neurodevelopment, we performed RNA immunoprecipitation-sequencing (RIP-seq) on human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs), and cortical neurons under unstressed conditions. While there was no change in TIA1 protein levels, the number of TIA1 targeted mRNAs decreased from pluripotent cells to neurons. We identified 2400, 845, and 330 TIA1 mRNA targets in hESCs, NPC, and neurons, respectively. The vast majority of mRNA targets in hESC were genes associated with neurodevelopment and included autism spectrum disorder-risk genes that were not bound in neurons. Additionally, we found that most TIA1 mRNA targets have reduced ribosomal engagement levels. Conclusion Our results reveal TIA1 mRNA targets in hESCs and during human neurodevelopment, indicate that translation repression is a key process targeted by TIA1 binding and implicate TIA1 function in neuronal differentiation.

TI The large part German medicine has played in the development of
   experimental pharmacology in Japan
SO NAUNYN-SCHMIEDEBERGS ARCHIVES OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB The history of hitherto existing pharmacology in Japan presented here is authored in commemoration of the 150th anniversary of Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology. After the publication of the new book of anatomy "Anatomische Tabellen" translated into Japanese in 1774, the foundation of understanding the medical science was gradually formed in Japan under seclusion policy, and, since the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the modernization of Japanese medicine was rapidly fostered on the basis of German medicine. Thus, the Japanese government officially adopted German medicine, and the philosophy and practice of German medical schools were incorporated. Most of the medical texts used in Japan were of German origins, often in Dutch translations, and many Japanese physicians and medical researchers studied abroad in Germany. The start of experimental pharmacology in Japan was also made up by Japanese disciples of Oswald Schmiedeberg, who was the one of founders of the Archives in 1873. Additionally, it was customary for professor candidates in charge of pharmacology in medical faculties in Japan to go to Germany and study pharmacology. Through such historical circumstances, the Japanese Pharmacology Society has been established to fulfill the responsibility for contributing internationally to world-class research achievements in the field of medical sciences by supplying numerous talented pharmacologists. During the course of the development of experimental pharmacology in Japan, the Archives has provided an excellent stage for many Japanese pharmacologists to publish their research outcomes to proliferate them internationally. Without German medicine influence, Japanese pharmacology would not have been what it is today.

TI Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of Locusta migratoria eggs at
   different embryonic stages: Comparison for diapause and non-diapause
   regimes
SO JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
AB Temperate-zone insects typically survive winter by entering diapause. Although many aspects of insect diapause have been studied, the underlying molecular mechanism of insect diapause is not well understood. Here we report the results of the transcriptional and translational differences of migratory locust eggs at different embryonic states using diapause (low temperature) and non-diapause (high temperature) regimes. Compared with non-diapause eggs at 100 degree-days (N2) treatment, 29671 transcripts and 296 proteins were differentially expressed at the diapause maintenance stage (D2). While compared with 150 degree-days (N3) treatment, 45922 transcripts and 404 proteins were differentially expressed in the post-diapause stage (D3). Among them, 51 and 102 transcripts had concurrent transcription and translation profiles in D2 vs. N2 and D3 vs. N3 treatments, respectively. Analysis of Gene Ontology categorized these genes and proteins into three categories: biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions. Biological pathway analysis indicated that three pathways: (1) insect hormone biosynthesis (KEGG: Map 00981), (2) the insulin signaling pathway (KEGG: Map 04910), and (3) the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway (KEGG: Map 03320) play an important role in locust diapause regulation. Most of these transcripts and proteins were up-regulated in the diapause treatments, and were highly linked to juvenile hormone biosynthesis, insulin and PPAR signaling pathways, suggesting these three pathways may be involved in diapause and development regulation. This study demonstrates the applicability of high-throughput omics tools to identify biochemical pathways linked to diapause in locust egg development. In addition, it reveals that cellular metabolism in diapause eggs is more inactive than in non-diapause eggs, and most of the down-regulated enzymes and pathways are related to reduce energy loss.

SO DEVELOPMENT GENES AND EVOLUTION
AB The Caenorhabditis elegans gene sup-26 encodes a well-conserved RNA-recognition motif-containing RNA-binding protein (RBP) that functions in dendrite morphogenesis of the PVD sensory neuron. The Drosophila ortholog of sup-26, alan shepard (shep), is expressed throughout the nervous system and has been shown to regulate neuronal remodeling during metamorphosis. Here, we extend these studies to show that sup-26 and shep are required for the development of diverse cell types within the nematode and fly nervous systems during embryonic and larval stages. We ascribe roles for sup-26 in regulating dendrite number and the expression of genes involved in mechanosensation within the nematode peripheral nervous system. We also find that in Drosophila, shep regulates dendrite length and branch order of nociceptive neurons, regulates the organization of neuronal clusters of the peripheral nervous system and the organization of axons within the ventral nerve cord. Taken together, our results suggest that shep/sup-26 orthologs play diverse roles in neural development across animal species. Moreover, we discuss potential roles for shep/sup-26 orthologs in the human nervous system.

TI The Intertextuality of the Apocalyptic in Mikhail Bulgakov's White Guard
SO PRIMERJALNA KNJIZEVNOST
AB The article is an analysis of apocalyptic context in Mikhail Bulgakov's first novel The White Guard, which depicts the period of the Civil War in 1918-1919 in Ukraine and follows the destiny of one family in the chaotic time of war, destruction, and downfall of the old regime. The White Guard, free from typical soviet ideological constraints, was strongly criticized by Soviet critics and was never published as a whole in Bulgakov's lifetime. In The White Guard Bulgakov uses numerous intertextual figures to refer to biblical texts, above all to The Book of Revelation, one of his most important sources. My analysis shows prevailing intertextual figures, explains their functions, and highlights the context in which they appear. I will clarify that Bulgakov uses intertextuality as one of the key elements of his literary style. All figures, quotes, allusions and stylizations are unified and have important functions in the construction of Bulgakov's literary world. My analysis shows that Bulgakov's mythological view of history differs from the traditional Christian one. Bulgakov views history as cyclical, which suggests to him the recurrence and convergence of images, so that they become multiplied and enriched. In The White Guard, images and symbols are introduced which reappear in Bulgakov's later fiction and dramas, such as the apocalyptic beast, apocalyptic horse-riders, snowstorm and the red star from Revelation. For a mythological vision, the idea of revival is essential. Similarly, for Bulgakov the end of the world may come many times and the end of one cycle always means the beginning of another. Bulgakov sees the history of Russia as an endless cycle of apocalyptic catastrophes brought about by wars. However, each ending brings new hope that people will learn the lesson of history and that the next cycle might be different. The eschatological and apocalyptic atmosphere of Bulgakov's works was reflected in his own experience. Born in 1891, Bulgakov witnessed the horrors of the Bolshevik revolution and Russian Civil War in Russia, which he comprehended as a realization of apocalyptic prophecy.

TI The specific expression pattern of globin mRNAs in Tibetan chicken
   during late embryonic stage under hypoxia
SO COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR & INTEGRATIVE
   PHYSIOLOGY
AB Tibetan chicken (Gallus gallus) is a specific chicken breed with strong ability to resist hypoxia, especially during embryonic stage. Though this breed has lived in Tibet plateau for thousands of years, the adaptive mechanism in response to hypoxia is still unknown. In order to obtain a better understanding of the mechanism of hypoxic adaptability in high altitude, we analyzed the mRNA expression pattern of globins in the present study. The fertilized eggs from Tibetan chicken and dwarf recessive white chicken breeds were incubated under normoxic (21% O-2) and hypoxic (13% O-2) conditions, equivalent to the altitude of 3600 m. We observed that Tibetan chicken embryos had higher hatchability (48%) in hypoxia than their lowland controls (7.8%). Northern blot showed that globin mRNA expression in Tibetan chicken embryos differed greatly from lowland controls under hypoxia. The expressions of four dominant globin mRNAs, named alpha(A), alpha(D), beta(A) and beta(H), were significantly induced under hypoxia. Tibetan chicken embryos had lower globin mRNA level in red cells than that of lowland controls at day 19 (P<0.05). Based on real-time PCR the same result was confirmed. Furthermore, we observed accumulation of globins induced by hypoxia in red cells by performing the separation of globin analysis, showing higher level of globins in red cells of Tibetan chicken embryos than that of lowland chicken embryos. Overall, our results provide new evidence that flexible regulation of globins at the level of transcription and translation may play a role in allowing the Tibetan chicken embryo to resist hypoxia.

TI Robust Data Augmentation Generative Adversarial Network for Object
   Detection
SO SENSORS
AB Generative adversarial network (GAN)-based data augmentation is used to enhance the performance of object detection models. It comprises two stages: training the GAN generator to learn the distribution of a small target dataset, and sampling data from the trained generator to enhance model performance. In this paper, we propose a pipelined model, called robust data augmentation GAN (RDAGAN), that aims to augment small datasets used for object detection. First, clean images and a small datasets containing images from various domains are input into the RDAGAN, which then generates images that are similar to those in the input dataset. Thereafter, it divides the image generation task into two networks: an object generation network and image translation network. The object generation network generates images of the objects located within the bounding boxes of the input dataset and the image translation network merges these images with clean images. A quantitative experiment confirmed that the generated images improve the YOLOv5 model's fire detection performance. A comparative evaluation showed that RDAGAN can maintain the background information of input images and localize the object generation location. Moreover, ablation studies demonstrated that all components and objects included in the RDAGAN play pivotal roles.

TI Reading and Interpreting Variants in Come and Go, Va-et-vient and Kommen
   und Gehen
SO JOURNAL OF BECKETT STUDIES
AB This paper focuses on textual variants in Come and Go, Va-et-vient and Kommen und Gehen and considers these variants as thresholds (Genette, 1997) into these works. This paper aims to show how Beckett's self-translating process, which was prolonged and complicated in the case of his plays when he directed them himself, produces a number of possible textual confusions, but also how these complications constitute insight into the Beckettian text. Indeed variants and rewritings point to moments in the writing and rewriting process when Beckett met resistant vitalities' mentioned by George Steiner in After Babel (1975). To illustrate this, I study Beckett's first dramaticule', Come and Go, by examining its pre-texts, the French translation, and Beckett's production notebooks for Kommen und Gehen. In these texts, I explore the motifs of death and ocular anxiety, as studied by Freud in his famous paper on The Uncanny.' I show how the Freudian uncanny actually reveals the parodic archaism of Beckett's drama, as a parallel is drawn between the structure of Beckett's play and Greek tragedy. Beckett's sometimes messy' rewritings in Come and Go, Va-et-vient and Kommen und Gehen served the performing intuitive perception in us of death, an issue explored here through the trope of femininity. Furthermore, comparing Beckett's Come and Go and Va-et-vient makes it easier to see Beckett progressing towards what Deleuze called a theatre of metamorphoses and permutations' in Difference and Repetition - a monograph published in France the very year Come and Go was first produced (1966).

TI Differential Expression of miR-499 and Validation of Predicted Target
   Genes in the Testicular Tissue of Swine at Different Developmental
   Stages
SO DNA AND CELL BIOLOGY
AB microRNAs (miRNAs) represent a newly identified class of nonprotein-coding approximate to 22nt small RNA that plays important roles in multiple biological processes by degrading targeted mRNA or repressing mRNA translation. This study observed the morphology of swine testicular tissue at different developmental stages (including 1-day old, 1-7 month old) by Hematoxylin-eosin staining. We also examined the expression of miR-499 and its target genes (CYLC1, DMRT1, QKI, XRN2, ZNF313) in samples of tissue slices using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, which showed that miR-499 had a significant negative correlation with QKI gene. Then, the proteins of QKI gene expression were determined by western blot, which were consistent with results of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) detection. Therefore, the luciferase reporter gene system was used to verify correlation between miR-499 and QKI gene. Activity of luciferase was significantly lower in miR-499 co-transfected with pmiR-RB-REPORT-QKI-WT group than the miR-499 co-transfected with pmiR-RB-REPORT-QKI-mut/si groups, indicating that target sequence of miR-499 existed in 3UTR of QKI gene. Furthermore, the expressions of miR-499 and QKI were detected in testicular cells that were transfected with miR-499, miR-499 negative control and untreated. The results showed that the diameter of convoluted seminiferous tubule growth increased with age. Significantly different expressions of miR-499 and its target genes were found in swine testicular tissue at different developmental stages (p<0.05), overexpressing miR-499 analysis, suggesting that miR-499 was negatively correlated to the expression of QKI (p<0.05). In conclusion, QKI is a target gene of miR-499.

SO ANUARIO CALDERONIANO
AB My research project aims to investigate the cultural relations between Spain and Hungary, through an in-depth analysis of the presence of Spanish theatre in Hungary, from the 18th-19th century until today. Apart from compiling a data base comprising the Hungarian translations and the Hungarian performances of Spanish dramas, I also examine in detail the most important aspects of the reception of Spanish theatre in Hungary. The analysis of the popularity and the presence of the dramas of Calderon de la Barca was especially important. I have traced the first appearance of his name, the translations of his dramas (first these were translated from German, later directly from Spanish), the performances of his plays from 1795 until today, and also their critical reception in the Hungarian press. The goal of the present article is to summarise the findings of this research, emphasising the role of certain Hungarian translators and directors, thanks to whom the Hungarian public became familiar with the name of Calderon de la Barca.

TI Translation Imaging in Parkinson's Disease: Focus on Neuroinflammation
SO FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE
AB Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and the appearance of alpha-synuclein insoluble aggregates known as Lewy bodies. Neurodegeneration is accompanied by neuroinflammation mediated by cytokines and chemokines produced by the activated microglia. Several studies demonstrated that such an inflammatory process is an early event, and contributes to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunctions. alpha-synuclein fibrillization and aggregation activate microglia and contribute to disease onset and progression. Mutations in different genes exacerbate the inflammatory phenotype in the monogenic compared to sporadic forms of PD. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) with selected radiopharmaceuticals allowin vivoimaging of molecular modifications in the brain of living subjects. Several publications showed a reduction of dopaminergic terminals and dopamine (DA) content in the basal ganglia, starting from the early stages of the disease. Moreover, non-dopaminergic neuronal pathways are also affected, as shown byin vivostudies with serotonergic and glutamatergic radiotracers. The role played by the immune system during illness progression could be investigated with PET ligands that target the microglia/macrophage Translocator protein (TSPO) receptor. These agents have been used in PD patients and rodent models, although often without attempting correlations with other molecular or functional parameters. For example, neurodegeneration and brain plasticity can be monitored using the metabolic marker 2-Deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoroglucose ([F-18]-FDG), while oxidative stress can be probed using the copper-labeled diacetyl-bis(N-methyl-thiosemicarbazone) ([Cu]-ATSM) radioligand, whose striatal-specific binding ratio in PD patients seems to correlate with a disease rating scale and motor scores. Also, structural and functional modifications during disease progression may be evaluated by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), using different parameters as iron content or cerebral volume. In this review article, we propose an overview ofin vivoclinical and non-clinical imaging research on neuroinflammation as an emerging marker of early PD. We also discuss how multimodal-imaging approaches could provide more insights into the role of the inflammatory process and related events in PD development.

TI Interactions of the Trypanosoma brucei brucei zinc-finger-domain protein
   ZC3H28
SO PARASITOLOGY
AB In Trypanosoma brucei and related Kinetoplastids, regulation of gene expression occurs mostly post-transcriptionally, and RNA-binding proteins play a critical role in the regulation of mRNA and protein abundance. Trypanosoma brucei ZC3H28 is a 114 KDa cytoplasmic mRNA-binding protein with a single C(x)(7)C(x)(5)C(x)(s)H zinc finger at the C-terminus and numerous proline-, histidine- or glutamine-rich regions. ZC3H28 is essential for normal bloodstream-form trypanosome growth, and when tethered to a reporter mRNA, ZC3H28 increased reporter mRNA and protein levels. Purification of N-terminally tagged ZC3H28 followed by mass spectrometry showed enrichment of ribosomal proteins, various RNA-binding proteins including both poly(A) binding proteins, the translation initiation complex EIF4E4/EIF4G3, and the activator MKT1. Tagged ZC3H28 was preferentially associated with long RNAs that have low complexity sequences in their 3'-untranslated regions; their coding regions also have low ribosome densities. In agreement with the tethering results, after ZC3H28 depletion, the levels of a significant proportion of its bound mRNAs decreased. We suggest that ZC3H28 is implicated in the stabilization of long mRNAs that are poorly translated.

TI Effects of Topography on Tree Community Structure in a Deciduous
   Broad-Leaved Forest in North-Central China
SO FORESTS
AB Topography strongly influences the compositional structure of tree communities and plays a fundamental role in classifying habitats. Here, data of topography and 16 dominant tree species abundance were collected in a fully mapped 25-ha forest plot in the Qinling Mountains of north-central China. Multivariate regression trees (MRT) were used to categorize the habitats, and habitat associations were examined using the torus-translation test. The relative contributions of topographic and spatial variables to the total community structure were also examined by variation partitioning. The results showed the inconsistency in association of species with habitats across life stages with a few exceptions. Topographic variables [a + b] explained 11% and 19% of total variance at adult and juvenile stage, respectively. In contrast, spatial factors alone [c] explained more variation than topographic factors, revealing strong seed dispersal limitation in species composition in the 25-ha forest plot. Thus, the inconsistent associations of species and habitats coupled with high portion of variation of species composition explained by topographic and spatial factors might suggest that niche process and dispersal limitation had potential influences on species assemblage in the deciduous broad-leaved forest in north-central China.

TI Translating Shakespeare's imagery for the Chinese audience With
   reference to Hamlet and its versions in Chinese and in European
   languages
SO BABEL-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE LA TRADUCTION-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF
   TRANSLATION
AB Generally speaking, the message of a poem is conveyed on three levels: the semantic, the syntactic, and the phonological. How translatable each of these levels is to the translator depends on how much cognation there is between the source and the target language: the more cognation there is, the more translatable each of these levels. Thus, in respect of all three levels, translation between languages of the same family, such as English and French, both of which belong to the Indo-European family, is easier than translation between languages of different families, such as English and Chinese, which belong respectively to the Indo-European and the Sino-Tibetan family.
   If a further distinction is to be made, one may say that, in translation between Chinese and European languages, the semantic level is less challenging than both the syntactic and the phonological level, since syntactic and phonological features are language-bound, and do not lend themselves readily to translation, whereas language pairs generally have corresponding words and phrases on the semantic level to express similar ideas or to describe similar objects, events, perceptions, and feelings.
   As an image owes its existence largely to its semantic content, the imagery of a poem is easier to translate than its phonological features. Be that as it may, there is yet another difference: the difference between the imagery of non-dramatic poetry and the imagery of poetic drama when it comes to translation. With reference to Hamlet and its versions in Chinese and in European languages, this paper discusses this difference and the challenges which the translator has to face when translating the imagery of poetic drama from one language into another; it also shows how translating Shakespeare's imagery from English into Chinese is more formidable than translating it from English into other European languages.

SO ALTRE MODERNITA-RIVISTA DI STUDI LETTERARI E CULTURALI
AB I would like to analyze a specific case of Shakespearean prison theatre. Un'isola. Dalla mia finestra si vedono le montagne (2018) is a rewriting of The Tempest by director Alessia Gennari, performed by an international cast consisting of some inmates of the prison of Vigevano (PV). A selection of the Shakespearean lines, translated into Italian, are accompanied by short sections composed directly by the inmates and by linguistic and cultural elements of diverse origin. In a total institution where the role of the prisoners is flattened on the conventional one of the criminal, the creative activity in the theatrical field allows to develop forms of resilience in the construction of stratified identities. Vulnerability can also be explored, even though it might be perceived as divergent from the condition of guilt. In this dimension, Shakespeare becomes the filter through which long unheard voices find the way to express themselves. At the same time, the text of The Tempestassumes the function of'pre-text', at the service of the prison and the prisoners themselves. Between Shakespeare's authority and the agency of the marginalized subjects, a stratified relationship is established, on whose declinations in dramaturgical and performative practice I would like to focus my attention.

TI Spanning the know-do gap: Understanding knowledge application and
   capacity in long-term care homes
SO SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB Using a multiple case study design, this article explores the translation process that emerges within Ontario long-term care (LTC) homes with the adoption and implementation of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Within-organization knowledge translation is referred to as knowledge application. We conducted 28 semi-structured interviews with a range of administrative and care staff within 7 homes differentiated by size, profit status, chain membership, and rural/urban location. We further undertook 7 focus groups at 5 locations, involving a total of 35 senior clinical staff representing 15 homes not involved in earlier structured interviews. The knowledge application process that emerges across our participant organizations is highly complex, iterative, and reliant upon a facility's knowledge application capacity, or absorptive capacity to effect change through learning. Knowledge application capacity underpins the emergence of the application process and the advancement of knowledge through it. We find that different elements of capacity are important to different stages of the knowledge application process. Capacity can preexist, or can be acquired. The majority of the capacity elements required for successful knowledge application in the LTC contexts we studied were organizational. It is essential for managers and practitioners therefore to conceptualize and orchestrate knowledge application initiatives at the organization level; organizational leaders (including clinical leaders) have a vital role to play in the success of knowledge application processes.

SO PERSPECTIVES-STUDIES IN TRANSLATION THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB This article presents a study that was aimed at assessing presence and emotional experience of blind and visually impaired users when exposed to emotive and non-emotive content with Polish audio description (AD) delivered with two voices: human and synthetic. The results show that AD narrated by a human prompted significantly higher levels of presence for drama and was assessed by participants as significantly more interesting and less confusing. Presence rates for documentary were similar, with no statistically significant differences in relation to AD voice type. Levels of interest and confusion were comparable for both voices, with a slightly higher result for interest for the clip with AD delivered by the synthetic voice. Overall, the respondents preferred human-narrated AD for drama, but did not show a preference between synthesized and human-narrated AD for documentary. The findings are of direct practical relevance both to the industry and to academia, as they provide important information on how to select voices for audiovisual productions in practice, and suggest that AD reproduced with a synthetic voice is an effective and viable solution for voicing documentaries.

TI Early Detection of Lung Carcinoma Using Machine Learning
SO INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION AND SOFT COMPUTING
AB Lung cancer is a poorly understood disease. Smokers may develop lung cancer due to the inhalation of carcinogenic substances while smoking, but nonsmokers may develop this disease as well. Lung cancer can spread to other parts of the body and this process is called metastasis. Because the lung cancer is difficult to identify in the initial stages. The objective of this work is to reduce the mortality rate of the disease by identifying it at an earlier stage based on the existing symptoms. Artificial intelligence plays active roles in tasks such as entropy extraction through preprocessing strategies, ordinal to cardinal value conversions, table normalizations for easy meta computations, and preparation of machine learning tools for iterative processes to achieve rational convergence. The machine learning methodologies incorporated in this work are the cross-validation classification tree, random forest cross-validation classification, and random tree, all of which are included in an ensemble algorithm. The ensemble algorithm classifies lung cancer with maximum precision rates. The outcome of the classification provides 94.3% accuracy, which is the highest precision rate in comparison with the conventional methodologies. Semantics preprocessing of a lung cancer training set is performed with least entropy, and then translation, aggregation, and navigation based methodologies are applied for identifying the disease at its initial stage.

   French opera in Italian studies
SO DIX-SEPTIEME SIECLE
AB Starting from 1990, French Italian studies concerning tragedy, tragi-comedy, pastorals, and opera have both developed the previous generation's studies of the Baroque era, and opened up new perspectives, taking into consideration dramatic paratexts and their relationships with dramatic texts. The main focus has been placed on the Italian influence and on the reevaluation of " minor" genres and authors, although tragedies, especially works by Racine, have not been forgotten. Comparativism has inspired key research with regard to the circulation, translation, and adaptation of dramatic texts within Romance languages. A significant number of critical editions have been published due to the critical tradition of Italian researchers in the areas of philology and history.

TI RECEPTION OF HENRI DE REGNIER'S POETRY BY MAXIMILIAN VOLOSHIN AND IGOR
   SEVERYANIN
SO STUDIA LITTERARUM
AB The article examines the reception of the poetry by a French poet Henri de Regnier in the works of Maximilian Voloshin and Igor Severyanin. Voloshin was a passionate promoter of Regnier in Russia; he appealed to him in criticism, translated his poems and prose, and considered him to be a forerunner of "neo-realism," a new stage of development in European and Russian literature. The interest of Severyanin in the work of Regnier develops under the influence of Voloshin's 1910 article "Henri de Regnier." The young Severyanin was influenced by this article and used accurate translations of Regner's two poems included in the article for his own translation experiments: he even made the same mistake as Voloshin when translating one of these poems. Compared to Voloshin's, Severyanin's versions are less accurate; they have stylistic shifts and ironic tones absent in the original. Thus, the example of Voloshin's and Severyanin's different attitudes to Regnier's poetry allows me to trace two different tendencies in the reception of Western authors within the culture of the so-called Russian Silver age: enthusiastic discipleship, more typical for Russian symbolists, and stylistic play and ironic distancing, more typical for Russian futurists.

AB This article examines the Russian translations of Lope de Vega's tragedy El castigo sin venganza (Punishment without Vengeance), with a special focus on the 1962 translation by Yuri Korneyev, which today remains the official and only available translation to the general Russian reader. The main objective of the study is to analyze how the meaning of the work changes in the translated version, due to a series of lexical decisions made by the translator. Specifically, I explore how Korneyev's decision to keep the nineteenth-century Russian translation of the title as Nakazaniene mschenie (Punishment Is Not Vengeance) affects his own interpretation of the tragedy and therefore his work with Lope's text.

TI Rice TSV3 Encoding Obg-Like GTPase Protein Is Essential for Chloroplast
   Development During the Early Leaf Stage Under Cold Stress
SO G3-GENES GENOMES GENETICS
AB The Spo0B-associated GTP-binding (Obg) proteins are essential for the viability of nearly all bacteria. However, the detailed roles of Obg proteins in higher plants have not yet been elucidated. In this study, we identified a novel rice (Oryza sativa L.) thermo-sensitive virescent mutant (tsv3) that displayed an albino phenotype at 20 degrees before the three-leaf stage while being a normal green at 32 degrees or even at 20 degrees after the four-leaf stage. The mutant phenotype was consistent with altered chlorophyll content and chloroplast structure in leaves. Map-based cloning and complementation experiments showed that TSV3 encoded a small GTP-binding protein. Subcellular localization studies revealed that TSV3 was localized to the chloroplasts. Expression of TSV3 was high in leaves and weak or undetectable in other tissues, suggesting a tissue-specific expression of TSV3. In the tsv3 mutant, expression levels of genes associated with the biogenesis of the chloroplast ribosome 50S subunit were severely decreased at the three-leaf stage under cold stress (20 degrees), but could be recovered to normal levels at a higher temperature (32 degrees). These observations suggest that the rice nuclear-encoded TSV3 plays important roles in chloroplast development at the early leaf stage under cold stress.

TI Two-Stage Surgery for the Malleolar Fracture-Dislocation With Severe
   Soft Tissue Injuries Does Not Affect the Functional Results
SO JOURNAL OF FOOT & ANKLE SURGERY
AB Soft tissue injuries associated with malleolar fracture-dislocations may increase postoperative rates of wound complication. Ankle-spanning frame plays a fundamental role in the local damage control orthopedics while gaining time for definitive surgery. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a 2-stage surgery for the unstable malleolar fracture-dislocations with severe soft tissue injuries compared to a 1-stage surgery in terms of the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot-ankle and Olerud-Molander ankle scores (OMAS). We analyzed 45 patients who met our study criteria. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to staged surgeries. Demographic data of patients, comorbidities, alcohol and tobacco use, Tscherne soft tissue injury scores, the AOFAS hindfoot-ankle and OMAS, postoperative complications, total hospitalization times, waiting time between stages, and waiting time from admission to surgery times were investigated. There was a statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of the mean total hospitalization times (p = .007), waiting time from admission to surgery (p < .001), gender (p = .005), and Tscherne soft tissue injury scores (p < .001). The mean AOFAS hindfoot-ankle and OMAS of the groups did not differ statistically at a minimum of 12 months of the follow-up period (p = .094 and p = .126, respectively). A 2-stage surgery can be performed safely in the carefully selected patients with the unstable malleolar fracture-dislocations with Tscherne grades 2 and 3 soft tissue injuries, and this surgery does not affect the postoperative AOFAS hindfoot-ankle and OMAS statistically compared to a 1-stage surgery at a minimum of 12 months of the follow-up period.

TI Comparative ribosome profiling uncovers a dominant role for
   translational control in Toxoplasma gondii
SO BMC GENOMICS
AB Background: The lytic cycle of the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, which involves a brief sojourn in the extracellular space, is characterized by defined transcriptional profiles. For an obligate intracellular parasite that is shielded from the cytosolic host immune factors by a parasitophorous vacuole, the brief entry into the extracellular space is likely to exert enormous stress. Due to its role in cellular stress response, we hypothesize that translational control plays an important role in regulating gene expression in Toxoplasma during the lytic cycle. Unlike transcriptional profiles, insights into genome-wide translational profiles of Toxoplasma gondii are lacking.
   Methods: We have performed genome-wide ribosome profiling, coupled with high throughput RNA sequencing, in intracellular and extracellular Toxoplasma gondii parasites to investigate translational control during the lytic cycle.
   Results: Although differences in transcript abundance were mostly mirrored at the translational level, we observed significant differences in the abundance of ribosome footprints between the two parasite stages. Furthermore, our data suggest that mRNA translation in the parasite is potentially regulated by mRNA secondary structure and upstream open reading frames.
   Conclusion: We show that most of the Toxoplasma genes that are dysregulated during the lytic cycle are translationally regulated.

TI From bench to bedside: A narrative review and institutional experience
   with experimental models for vascular device design and translation
SO SEMINARS IN VASCULAR SURGERY
AB The past 2 decades have seen a rise in vascular innovations and a rapid evolution in endovascular device technology, with the emergence of atherectomy, intravascular lithotripsy, drug elution technology, thrombectomy devices, and many more. Like all other medical devices, vascular devices undergo a life cycle composed of a concept phase, a planning and design phase, a regulatory process, a launch phase, and a post-market stage. Experimental and preclinical models are required at various stages of the life cycle to aid in the designing, refining, and feasibility testing of novel devices before they are transferred to clinical practice. The experimental testing of these devices relies heavily on the ability to simulate human anatomy and physiology, and to mimic or induce specific disease processes. Computational and benchtop models play very important roles at the early stages of the manufacturing process, and animal and cadaveric models are indispensable for testing the mechanistic performance, safety, and efficacy of novel devices before they are used in clinical trials and regulatory approval is obtained for public use.

TI The rice OsV4 encoding a novel pentatricopeptide repeat protein is
   required for chloroplast development during the early leaf stage under
   cold stress
SO JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE PLANT BIOLOGY
AB Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins, characterized by tandem arrays of a 35 amino acid motif, have been suggested to play central and broad roles in modulating the expression of organelle genes in plants. However, the molecular mechanisms of most rice PPR genes remains unclear. In this paper, we isolated and characterized a temperature-conditional virescent mutant, OsV4, in rice (Oryza sativa cultivar Jiahua1 (WT, japonica rice variety)). The mutant displays albino phenotype and abnormal chloroplasts at the three leaf stage, which gradually turns green after the four leaf stage at a low temperature (20 degrees C). But the mutant always develops green leaves and well-developed chloroplasts at a high temperature (32 degrees C). Genetic and molecular analyses uncovered that OsV4 encodes a novel chloroplast-targeted PPR protein including four PPR motifs. Further investigations show that the mutant phenotype is associated with changes in chlorophyll content and chloroplast development. The OsV4 transcripts only accumulate to high levels in young leaves, indicating that its expression is tissue-specific. In addition, transcript levels of some ribosomal components and plastid-encoded polymerase-dependent genes are dramatically reduced in the albino mutants grown at 20 degrees C. These findings suggest that OsV4 plays an important role during early chloroplast development under cold stress in rice.

TI LncRNA SNHG6 plays an oncogenic role in colorectal cancer and can be
   used as a prognostic biomarker for solid tumors
SO JOURNAL OF CELLULAR PHYSIOLOGY
AB Small nucleolar RNA host gene 6 (SNHG6) has been recognized as an oncogene in numerous cancers and overexpression of SNHG6 was found to promote colorectal cancer (CRC). Hence, we performed a meta-analysis to examine the clinical importance of the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) SNHG6. Moreover, comprehensive identification of RNA-binding proteins-mass spectrometry (ChIRP-MS) was conducted to explore the carcinogenic mechanism of lncRNA SNHG6 in CRC. Fourteen studies conducted on 1,139 patients were included in this meta-analysis. We also constructed the protein-protein interactive (PPI) network in string based on the ChIRP-MS results and cytoscape was used to identify core modules in the PPI network, which were then analyzed using the bioinformatics websites, cancer single-cell state atlas (CancerSEA) and G:profilter. The clinical outcomes of the meta-analysis indicated that higher expression of SNHG6 was related with a poorer survival outcome (overall survival: hazard ratio (HR) = 1.92; 95% confidence interval [Cl]: 1.48, 2.49; p < .0001; disease-free survival: HR = 1.84; 95% Cl: 1.02, 3.34; p = .044), higher tumor stage (odds ratio [OR] = 3.35; 95% Cl: 2.57, 4.37; p < .0001), distant metastasis (OR = 1.83; 95% Cl: 1.11, 2.99; p = .017) and lymph node metastasis (OR = 1.33; 95% Cl: 0.93, 1.89; p = .119). The ChIRP-MS results showed that core Module 1 of the PPI was significant in ribosomes and core Module 2 was mainly related to spliceosomes and messenger RNA processing. In conclusion, a higher expression of SNHG6 was found to be associated with a poorer survival outcome, high tumor stage, and distant metastasis in various solid tumors. SNHG6 was also found to be able to affect the processes of transcription and translation to promote CRC.

TI Health literacy - engaging the community in the co-creation of
   meaningful health navigation services: a study protocol
SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB Background: A large proportion of patients encounter barriers to access and navigation in complex healthcare systems. They are unable to obtain information and services and to take appropriate action to improve their health. Low health literacy affects the ability of individuals to benefit from health services. Some social groups are disproportionately affected by low health literacy, including those with low educational attainment Aboriginal people, and those on social assistance. These individuals face significant barriers in self-management of chronic diseases and in navigating the healthcare system. For these people, living in a context of deprivation contributes to maintaining disparities in access to healthcare and services. The objective of this study is to support knowledge co-construction and knowledge translation in primary care and services by involving underserved and Aboriginal people in research.
   Methods: This study will integrate participatory health processes and action research to co-create, with patients, individuals, and community members impacted by health literacy, practical recommendations or solutions for facilitating navigation of the healthcare system by patients, individuals, and community members with less than optimal health literacy on how to best access health services. With this approach, academics and those for whom the research is intended will collaborate closely in all stages of the research to identify findings of immediate benefit to those impacted by health literacy and work together on knowledge translation. This study, carried out by researchers, community organizations and groups of people with low health literacy from three different regions of Quebec and Saskatchewan who can play an expert role in improving health services, will be conducted in three phases: 1) data collection; 2) data analysis and interpretation; and, 3) knowledge translation.
   Discussion: Persons with low health literacy experience major obstacles in navigating the health system. This project will therefore contribute to addressing the gap between healthcare challenges and the needs of underserved patients with multi-morbidity and/or low health literacy who have complex health-related needs. It will pave the way for cocreating successful solutions for and with these communities that will increase their access to health services.

TI UNDOING WONDER: BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER SECULARIZE CERVANTES
SO FORUM FOR MODERN LANGUAGE STUDIES
AB This essay explores Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher's transposition of Cervantes's Las dos doncellas (1613) into the English tragicomic play Love's Pilgrimage (1615). The article focuses on the process of transposition as a linguistic, cultural and ideological exchange between early modern England and Spain, demonstrating how translation contributes to the emergence of literary forms and genres. I argue that Beaumont and Fletcher's borrowing of Cervantes allowed them to develop an innovative model of stage tragicomedy. The English playwrights transposed the providentialism of Cervantes's novella into the self-conscious theatrical design of their play, but also retained and emphasized the latent double consciousness of Las dos doncellas. Using Cervantes as their departure point, Beaumont and Fletcher crafted a form of tragicomedy that was sceptical of both divine and monarchical authority, offering an alternative mode of organizing the universe based on the workings of theatre itself.

TI A DEAD-box RNA helicase TCD33 that confers chloroplast development in
   rice at seedling stage under cold stress
SO JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
AB Cold stress is one of the most common unfavorable environmental factors affecting the growth, development, and survival of plants. The DEAD-box RNA helicases play important roles in all types of processes of RNA metabolism. However, the function of DEAD-box RNA helicase under cold stress is poorly explored in plants, especially in rice. This study reported the identification of a novel rice thermo-sensitive chlorophyll-deficient mutant, tcd33, which displayed an albino phenotype before the four-leaf stage, then withered and eventually died at 20 degrees C, while wild-type plants exhibited normal green coloration at 32 degrees C. The tcd33 seedlings also exhibited less chlorophyll contents and severe defects of chloroplast structure under 20 degrees C condition. Map-based cloning and complementation experiments suggested that TCD33 encodes a chloroplast-located DEAD-box RNA helicase protein. The transcript expression level of TCD33 indicated that the genes related to chlorophyll (Chl) biosynthesis, photosynthesis, and chloroplast development in tcd33 mutants were down-regulated at 20 degrees C, while the down-regulated genes were nearly recovered to or slightly higher than the WT level at 32 degrees C. Together, our results suggest that the cold-inducible TCD33 is essential for early chloroplast development and is important for cold-responsive gene regulation and cold tolerance in rice.

TI iTRAQ-based comparative proteome analyses of different growth stages
   revealing the regulatory role of reactive oxygen species in the fruiting
   body development of Ophiocordyceps sinensis
SO PEERJ
AB In this study, using an isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) approach coupled with LC-MS / MS and bioinformatics, the proteomes were analyzed for the crucial three stages covering the fruiting body development of Ophiocordyceps sinensis, including sclerotium (ST), primordium (PR) and mature fruiting body (MF), with a focus on fruiting body development-related proteins and the potential mechanisms of the development. A total of 1,875 proteins were identified. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) demonstrated that the protein patterns between PR and MF were more similar than ST. Differentially accumulated proteins (DAPs) analysis showed that there were 510, 173 and 514 DAPs in the comparisons of ST vs. PR, PR vs. MF and ST vs. MF, respectively. A total of 62 shared DAPs were identified and primarily enriched in proteins related to 'carbon transport and mechanism', 'the response to oxidative stress', 'antioxidative activity' and 'translation'. KEGG and GO databases showed that the DAPs were enriched in terms of 'primary metabolisms (amino acid/fatty acid/energy metabolism)', 'the response to oxidative stress' and 'peroxidase'. Furthermore, 34 DAPs involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism were identified and clustered across the three stages using hierarchical clustering implemented in hCluster R package . It was suggested that their roles and the underlying mechanisms may be stage-specific. ROS may play a role in fungal pathogenicity in ST, the fruit-body initiation in PR, sexual reproduction and highland adaptation in MF. Crucial ROS-related proteins were identified, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD, T5A6F1), Nor-1 (T5AFX3), electron transport protein (T5AHD1), histidine phosphotransferase (HPt, T5A9Z5) and Glutathione peroxidase (T5A9V1). Besides, the accumulation of ROS at the three stages were assayed using 2,7-dichlorofuorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) stanning. A much stronger ROS accumulation was detected at the stage MF, compared to the stages of PR and ST. Sections of ST and fruit-body part of MF were stained by DCFH-DA and observed under the fluorescencemicroscope, showing ROS was distributed within the conidiospore and ascus. Besides, SOD activity increased across the three stages, while CAT activity has a strong increasement in MF compared to the stages of ST and PR. It was suggested that ROS may act in gradient-dependent manner to regulate the fruiting body development. The coding region sequences of six DAPs were analyzed at mRNA level by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The results support the result of DAPs analysis and the proteome sequencing data. Our findings offer the perspective of proteome to understand the biology of fruiting body development and highland adaptation in O. sinensis, which would inform the big industry of this valuable fungus.

TI 'I want my closet back': queering and unqueering language in Giannina
   Braschi's Yo-Yo Boing!
SO TEXTUAL PRACTICE
AB This essay examines how anxieties about language, gender fluidity, and queer desire intersect in Giannina Braschi's 1998 bilingual novel Yo-Yo Boing!. Identifying the novel's 'translingualism' (the ways in which its English and Spanish interact, transform, and enhance one another), as a key part of its textual difficulty, it argues that Braschi's use of language constitutes a queer practice. That language is altered, however, in Tess O'Dwyer's 2011 'translation' of the novel into only English, which this essay reads as an integral part of Braschi's highly self-referential postmodern play. Responding to its own characters' anxieties, it 'un-queers' their language and thus mitigates the novel's difficulty; this complements the strategy of its new publisher, AmazonCrossing, which hopes to appeal to a wide readership. Viewed as a complex, contradictory, collaborative whole, the two versions of Yo-Yo Boing! blur the lines between production and reception, interpretation and praxis, subverting the traditionally hierarchical relationship between original and translation to instead propose the latter as a condition of textual production.

TI The Linguistic and Literary Identity of a "Rootless" and "Half-American"
   German Language Writer: Exophone Writing and Self-Translation in Frank
   Wedekind's Lulu
SO RLC-REVUE DE LITTERATURE COMPAREE
AB While readers and the public generally ignore this fact, Frank Wedekind's Lulu drama was first written as a trilingual play. Thus, Die Bikhse der Pandora (1894), the original version of his masterpiece, includes numerous and extensive passages in French and English. Yet a long process of censorship and self-censorship gradually led to the eradication of the work's multilingual dimension. This paper aims at analyzing the aesthetic implications of Wedekind's practice of exophony and selftranslation. In this way, I argue, Wedekind's early multilingualism appears as a major factor of his radical modernity around 1900.

TI Performing Shakespeare in a Conflicting Cultural Context: Othello in
   Francoist Spain
SO SEDERI-YEARBOOK OF THE SPANISH AND PORTUGUESE SOCIETY FOR ENGLISH
   RENAISSANCE STUDIES
AB The present article reviews the stage history of Othello in Spain and, in particular, it focuses on two performances of the play staged at the Espanol theatre during Franco's dictatorship, in 1944 and 1971 respectively. Othello was one of the Shakespearean plays programmed by the regime to give cultural prestige to the "national" theatre. By comparing both productions, this paper explores how the performance of Othello evolved during the dictatorship. Furthermore, it shows how the repressive force of state censorship was exerted to promote certain theatrical conventions and to prevent theatre directors and translators from offering new readings and updatings of the plays, in the case of Othello, for almost thirty years.

TI Plautus goes USA: the adaptation of Rudens by the Ladies' Literary
   Society of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1884
SO CLASSICAL RECEPTIONS JOURNAL
AB This article investigates the first documented performance of a Plautine comedy in Latin in the USA. In 1884, The Ladies' Literary Society of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, staged Plautus' Rudens in Latin with an allfemale cast. This performance offers a unique opportunity to analyse the Society's understanding and interpretation of Plautus' play as well as its adaptation for the nineteenth-century stage. Furthermore, the Society provided an English translation for its academic and especially its non-academic audience, evidence of how the Society dealt with the Plautine Latin text. Based on this translation and contemporary newspaper and journal articles, this article outlines the main characteristics of the Society's adaptation. First, this production merits scrutiny in the historical context of staging ancient Greek and Roman plays in the USA during the late-nineteenth century, since the Society followed the trend, started by Harvard University's staging of Sophocles' Oedipus Tyrannus in 1881, of presenting ancient plays 'authentically'. Nevertheless, the Society seems to have staged this Roman comedy as a feminist response to Harvard's production of a Greek tragedy. Secondly, the Society modernised Plautus' comedy by adding strong melodramatic elements, and thirdly, it reflected the contemporary socio-cultural context by alluding to current American concerns.

TI Plant Small RNA World Growing Bigger: tRNA-Derived Fragments,
   Longstanding Players in Regulatory Processes
SO FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR BIOSCIENCES
AB In the past 2 decades, the discovery of a new class of small RNAs, known as tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs), shed light on a new layer of regulation implicated in many biological processes. tRFs originate from mature tRNAs and are classified according to the tRNA regions that they derive from, namely 3 ' tRF, 5 ' tRF, and tRF-halves. Additionally, another tRF subgroup deriving from tRNA precursors has been reported, the 3 ' U tRFs. tRF length ranges from 17 to 26 nt for the 3 ' and 5 ' tRFs, and from 30 to 40 nt for tRF-halves. tRF biogenesis is still not yet elucidated, although there is strong evidence that Dicer (and DICER-LIKE) proteins, as well as other RNases such as Angiogenin in mammal and RNS proteins family in plants, are responsible for processing specific tRFs. In plants, the abundance of those molecules varies among tissues, developmental stages, and environmental conditions. More recently, several studies have contributed to elucidate the role that these intriguing molecules may play in all organisms. Among the recent discoveries, tRFs were found to be involved in distinctive regulatory layers, such as transcription and translation regulation, RNA degradation, ribosome biogenesis, stress response, regulatory signaling in plant nodulation, and genome protection against transposable elements. Although tRF biology is still poorly understood, the field has blossomed in the past few years, and this review summarizes the most recent developments in the tRF field in plants.

TI Validation of Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS)
   in Vietnamese Among People Living with HIV/AIDS
SO AIDS AND BEHAVIOR
AB Social support plays a vital role in the health of HIV/AIDS patients, but there needs to be a validated instrument to measure social support in Vietnam. This cross-sectional study was to validate a Vietnamese translation of the Multidimensional Perceived Social Support Scale (MSPSS). The study had three stages: [1] translation to Vietnamese, [2] pilot testing, and [3] validation of the translation. Stage 1, including forward and backward translation by four independent translators, resulted in a good content validity translation. Pilot testing was done on 30 HIV/AIDS patients: the translation was understandable, and no change was required. Five hundred HIV/AIDS patients were recruited in stage 3. The translation had excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha: 0.90), good test-retest reliability (intra-class correlation coefficient: 0.95), and good concurrent validity. Construct validity was well established by confirmatory factor analysis. The Vietnamese translation of the MSPSS is reliable and valuable for measuring perceived social support.

TI Species-habitat associations in an old-growth temperate forest in
   northeastern China
SO BMC ECOLOGY
AB Background: Species coexistence mechanisms and maintenance of biodiversity have long been considered important components of community ecology research. As one of the important mechanisms, species coexistence theory based on niche differentiation has received attention in past years. Thus, topography, through the formation of habitat heterogeneity, affects species distributions and coexistence. A 30-ha dynamic plot of mixed broadleaved-Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) forest is located in the Heilongjiang Fenglin National Nature Reserve. We examined species-habitat associations using the torus-translation method. We aim to understand the habitat associations of different species, life forms (shrubs, trees), and shade tolerance (light-demanding, midtolerant, shade-tolerant) across life stages (sapling, juvenile and mature), providing further evidence for the role of niche theory in temperate forests.
   Results: Of the 33 species we tested, 28 species (84.8%) were at least significantly associated with one habitat type. Positive associations were more frequent in the valley and slope (shady and sunny) and less frequent on the ridge. Thirty-four significant positive associations with the five habitats were detected at three life stages (11, 11 and 12 at the sapling stage, juvenile stage, and mature stage, respectively). The trees were positively associated with the valley, and the shrubs were positively associated with sunny and ridge. The majority of species' habitat preferences shifted among different life stages; the exceptions were Corylus mandshurica, Maackia amurensis, Quercus mongolica, Picea jezoensis and Acer ukurunduense, which had consistent associations with the same habitat at all stages. The midtolerant trees and midtolerant shrubs were positively correlated with sunny across the three life stages.
   Conclusions: Most species show habitat preferences in the plot. These results indicate that niche theory plays an important role in species coexistence. Most species have no consistent association with habitat at different life stages.

Thus, the international Latin Republic of Letters was foreign in its use of another language, but it was common in the use of the same subjects, motifs and structures.

TI From Social Justice to Metaphor: The Whitening of Othello in the Russian
   Imagination
SO MULTICULTURAL SHAKESPEARE-TRANSLATION APPROPRIATION AND PERFORMANCE
AB Othello was the most often-staged Shakespeare play on early Soviet stages, to a large extent because of its ideological utility. Interpreted with close attention to racial conflict, this play came to symbolize, for Soviet theatres and audiences, the destructive racism of the West in contrast with Soviet egalitarianism. In the first decades of the twenty-first century, however, it is not unusual for Russian theatres to stage Othello as a white character, thus eliminating the theme of race from the productions. To make sense of the change in the Russian tradition of staging Othello, this article traces the interpretations and metatheatrical uses of this character from the early Soviet period to the present day. I argue that the Soviet tradition of staging Othello in blackface effectively prevented the use of the play for exploring the racial tensions within the Soviet Union itself, and gradually transformed the protagonist's blackness into a generalized metaphor of oppression. As post-collapse Russia embraced whiteness as a category, Othello's blackness became a prop that was entirely decoupled from race and made available for appropriation by ethnically Slavic actors and characters. The case of Russia demonstrates that staging Othello in blackface, even when the initial stated goals are those of racial equality, can serve a cultural fantasy of blackness as a versatile and disposable mask placed over a white face.

Examples range widely across media, from the audio recordings of Patrick Magee to the experimental jazz records of Michael Mandel, and from the recent stage work of Care St Lazare to the art installation of Miroslaw Balka. Such works reflect the experimental character of the novel itself, forcing a reconsideration of the discourse of the 'unperformable.'

TI Ted Hughes: The Importance of Fostering Creative Writing as
   Environmental Education
SO CHILDRENS LITERATURE IN EDUCATION
AB Ted Hughes is one of the most important poets in English literature of the last century and his huge volume of work (including his poetry, prose, plays, translations, letters and critical essays) has received a great deal of critical attention. Hughes was, of course, much more than just a writer. Throughout his life he was deeply engaged with environmental and ecological issues, and his own sense of environmental responsibility can be seen through his local call to action. That Hughes's work touches on political and ethical concerns related to environmental issues has been well documented by critics such as Scigaj (1991), Gifford (1995), Sagar (2005), and more recently Reddick (2017). However, the link between these concerns and the importance that Hughes attached, throughout his working life, to engaging with children's environmental imaginations, and the depth of his educational achievements for children, have received little attention to date. This article explores Hughes' educational achievements and his ongoing involvement in a number of projects related to helping young children to write poetry, together with his work as a children's poetry judge, which began in the 1960s, and his role in establishing the Arvon Foundation. It also looks at his commitment to educational projects such as Farms for City Children and his founding of the Sacred Earth Drama Trust, in the 1990s. These projects exemplify the relationship between his life-long commitment to local activism, and the impact his ideas had on such organisations underlying his concern to instil what Rachel Carson (1965) called a sense of wonder, by advocating environmental consciousness together with hope in younger generations.

TI N6-methyladenosine plays a dual role in arsenic carcinogenesis by
   temporal-specific control of core target AKT1
SO JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB High-profile RNA epigenetic modification N6-methyladenosine (m6A), as a double-edged sword for cancer, can either promote or inhibit arsenic-induced skin carcinogenesis. However, the core m6A-target gene determining the duality of m6A and the regulatory mechanism of m6A on the core gene are still poorly understood. Based on m6A microarray detection, integrated multi-omics analysis, and further experiments in vitro and in vivo, we explored the molecular basis for the dual role of m6A in cancer induced by environmental pollutants using models in different stages of arsenic carcinogenesis, including As-treated, As-transformed, and As-tumorigenic cell models. We found that the key proliferative signaling node AKT1 is in the center of the m6A-regulatory network in arsenic carcinogenicity. The m6A level on AKT1 mRNA (3'UTR, CDS, and 5'UTR) dynamically changed in different stages of arsenic carcinogenesis. The m6A writer METTL3-catalyzed upregulation of m6A promotes AKT1 expression by elevating m6A reader YTHDF1-mediated AKT1 mRNA stability in As-treated and As-transformed cells, while the m6A eraser FTO-catalyzed downregulation of m6A promotes AKT1 expression mainly by inhibiting m6A reader YTHDF2-mediated AKT1 mRNA degradation in As-tumorigenic cells. Furthermore, upregulation of m6A inhibits the expression of AKT1 negative regulator PHLPP2 and promotes the expression of AKT1 positive regulator PDK1. These changes in AKT1 regulators result in AKT1 activation by upregulating AKT1 phosphorylation at S473 and T308. Interestingly, the FTO-catalyzed decrease in m6A pre-vents AKT upregulation in As-treated cells but promotes AKT upregulation in As-tumorigenic cells. Both in-hibitors targeting the m6A writer and eraser can inhibit the AKT1-mediated proliferation of As-tumorigenic cells by breaking the balance of m6A regulators. Our results demonstrated that AKT1 is the core hub determining m6A as a double-edged sword. Changed m6A dynamically upregulates the expression and activity of AKT1 in different stages of arsenic carcinogenesis. This study can advance our understanding of the dual role and precise time -specific mechanism of RNA epigenetics involved in the carcinogenesis of hazardous materials.

SO RLC-REVUE DE LITTERATURE COMPAREE
AB This article tries to explore Cesar Vallejo's (1892-1938) presence in the archives of Claude Esteban (1935-2006), poet and translator whose works respond to the drama of bilingualism. The study of his translations of the Peruvian poet wants to reveal the intimate links between translation and poetic creation, whose necessity, in Claude Esteban, lies in the perilous attempt or the temptation of a reconciliation between French and Spanish, the languages that, for long, held him "quartered".

TI Distinct tmRNA sequence elements facilitate RNase R engagement on
   rescued ribosomes for selective nonstop mRNA decay
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB trans-Translation, orchestrated by SmpB and tmRNA, is the principal eubacterial pathway for resolving stalled translation complexes. RNase R, the leading nonstop mRNA surveillance factor, is recruited to stalled ribosomes in a trans-translation dependent process. To elucidate the contributions of SmpB and tmRNA to RNase R recruitment, we evaluated Escherichia coli-Francisella tularensis chimeric variants of tmRNA and SmpB. This evaluation showed that while the hybrid tmRNA supported nascent polypeptide tagging and ribosome rescue, it suffered defects in facilitating RNase R recruitment to stalled ribosomes. To gain further insights, we used established tmRNA and SmpB variants that impact distinct stages of the trans-translation process. Analysis of select tmRNA variants revealed that the sequence composition and positioning of the ultimate and penultimate codons of the tmRNA ORF play a crucial role in recruiting RNase R to rescued ribosomes. Evaluation of defined SmpB C-terminal tail variants highlighted the importance of establishing the tmRNA reading frame, and provided valuable clues into the timing of RNase R recruitment to rescued ribosomes. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that productive RNase R-ribosomes engagement requires active trans-translation, and suggest that RNase R captures the emerging nonstop mRNA at an early stage after establishment of the tmRNA ORF as the surrogate mRNA template.

TI The Poetics of Body: Representing Cultural Imaginations in Yang
   Jung-Ung's A Midsummer Night's Dream
SO MULTICULTURAL SHAKESPEARE-TRANSLATION APPROPRIATION AND PERFORMANCE
AB This article explores the psychology that motivates Yang Jung-Ung and his actors in the process of translating Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream into a Korean style. By focusing on the ways of showing the theme of the play in modern styles fused with traditional modes of theatrical practice, the director attempts to develop his own ways of expression to communicate with the modern Korean audience. In this process, Yang reconstructs the dialogues between the characters rather than rely heavily on Shakespeare's text and language. For this reason, his production has often been criticised for missing Shakespeare's poetry. However, the beauty of poetry is not only in Shakespeare's language itself, but rather it is in the mental process of how the artist and audiences understand and translate its meaning in their cultural contexts. Shakespeare's language includes a great deal of imagery that provides the artists with concrete information for constructing the stage mise-en-scene. In Yang's production, Shakespeare's poetry is expressed through the visual images created by the performer's physical bodies, which reflects the director's interpretation of the play in his cultural context. By analysing the performers' physical movements, this article studies how Yang perceives the theme of Shakespeare's Dream in relation to a Korean cultural context and presents his unique vision on the play.

TI Paired-unpaired Unsupervised Attention Guided GAN with transfer learning
   for bidirectional brain MR-CT synthesis
SO COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
AB Medical image acquisition plays a significant role in the diagnosis and management of diseases. Magnetic Resonance (MR) and Computed Tomography (CT) are considered two of the most popular modalities for medical image acquisition. Some considerations, such as cost and radiation dose, may limit the acquisition of certain image modalities. Therefore, medical image synthesis can be used to generate required medical images without actual acquisition. In this paper, we propose a paired-unpaired Unsupervised Attention Guided Generative Adversarial Network (uagGAN) model to translate MR images to CT images and vice versa. The uagGAN model is pre-trained with a paired dataset for initialization and then retrained on an unpaired dataset using a cascading process. In the paired pre-training stage, we enhance the loss function of our model by combining the Wasserstein GAN adversarial loss function with a new combination of non-adversarial losses (content loss and L1) to generate fine structure images. This will ensure global consistency, and better capture of the high and low frequency details of the generated images. The uagGAN model is employed as it generates more accurate and sharper images through the production of attention masks. Knowledge from a non-medical pre-trained model is also transferred to the uagGAN model for improved learning and better image translation performance. Quantitative evaluation and qualitative perceptual analysis by radiologists indicate that employing transfer learning with the proposed paired-unpaired uagGAN model can achieve better performance as compared to other rival image-to-image translation models.

TI Lost in translation: applying 2D intercellular communication via
   tunneling nanotubes in cell culture to physiologically relevant 3D
   microenvironments
SO FEBS JOURNAL
AB Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) are membranous conduits for direct cell-to-cell communication. Until the past decade, little had been known about their composite structure, function, and mechanisms of action in both normal physiologic conditions as well as in disease states. Now TNTs are attracting increasing interest for their key role(s) in the pathogenesis of disease, including neurodegenerative disorders, inflammatory and infectious diseases, and cancer. The field of TNT biology is still in its infancy, but inroads have been made in determining potential mechanisms and function of these remarkable structures. For example, TNTs function as critical conduits for cellular exchange of information; thus, in cancer, they may play an important role in critical pathophysiologic features of the disease, including cellular invasion, metastasis, and emergence of chemotherapy drug resistance. Although the TNT field is still in a nascent stage, we propose that TNTs can be investigated as novel targets for drug-based treatment of cancer and other diseases.

TI Transcultural Consumption through a "Queer" Narrative: Douglas Maxwell's
   Our Bad Magnet in Seoul
SO THEATRE JOURNAL
AB Although Korean director Choo Min Ju translation and adaptation of Scottish playwright Douglas Maxwell's coming-of-age drama Our Bad Magnet may look like a straightforward case of East-to-West intercultural appropriation, this essay argues that Choo's insertion of a new romantic narrative between two male characters not only "queers" the text, but offers the Western observer an alternative entrance into the discussion of appropriation that queers the idea of the intercultural itself. Rather than approaching Maxwell's text as a source to which the director remains indebted in the creation of her own intercultural synthesis, the essay reads Choo's Our Bad Magnet as the transcultural consumption of a resource, not only on the part of Choo, but also by the very active online theatre fan community in Seoul. Her production intervenes not only in contemporary mainstream Korean culture's dominant attitudes toward the LGBTQ community, but also the Western theatre scholar's assumptions about the relationship between "source" and "target" cultures in acts of intercultural transference and consumption.

AB A study of the Greek text, of Sophocles' Antigone provides a deeper understanding of the identities and psychodynamic interaction between the play's two main characters. Creon's particular diction, imagery, and even syntax constitute a subtext reflecting his rigidly hierarchical attitude and paranoid fear that defensively overlie his castration anxiety, his persecutory conception of women, and his own body image. His mental collapse is precipitated by the insightful and lexically powerful ad hominem expressions featured in Tiresias's admonitions. Textual analysis also sheds light, on the nature of Antigone's incestuous desires for intimacy and clarifies their archaic origins. As death becomes more imminent, Antigone's complex, evolving reaction includes a verbally marked spatial, disorientation.

TI Tragedy in the Arab Theatre: the Neglected Genre
SO NEW THEATRE QUARTERLY
AB In this article Safi Mahmoud Mahfouz investigates the current state of tragedy in the Arab theatre and suggests some of the reasons behind the lack of an authentic Arabic tragedy developed from the Aristotelian tradition. Through analyses of the few translations and adaptations into Arabic of Shakespearean and classical tragedy, he both confirms and questions the claims of non-Arabic scholars that 'the Arab mind is incapable of producing tragedy'. While the wider theatre community has been introduced to a handful of the Arab world's most prominent dramatists in translation, many are still largely unknown and none has a claim to be a tragedian. Academic studies of Arabic tragedy are insubstantial, while tragedy, in the classical sense, plays a very minor role in Arab drama, the tendency of Arab dramatists being towards comedy or melodrama. Safi Mahmoud Mahfouz is Head of the Department of English Language and Literature at UNRWA University, Amman, Jordan. His research interests include American Literature, Arabic and Middle Eastern literatures, modern and contemporary drama, contemporary poetics, comparative literature, and synchronous and asynchronous instructional technology.

TI AKAP3 Synthesis Is Mediated by RNA Binding Proteins and PKA Signaling
   During Mouse Spermiogenesis
SO BIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION
AB Mammalian spermatogenesis is regulated by coordinated gene expression in a spatiotemporal manner. The spatiotemporal regulation of major sperm proteins plays important roles during normal development of the male gamete, of which the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. A-kinase anchoring protein 3 (AKAP3) is one of the major components of the fibrous sheath of the sperm tail that is formed during spermiogenesis. In the present study, we analyzed the expression of sperm-specific Akap3 and the potential regulatory factors of its protein synthesis during mouse spermiogenesis. Results showed that the transcription of Akap3 precedes its protein synthesis by about 2 wk. Nascent AKAP3 was found to form protein complex with PKA and RNA binding proteins (RBPs), including PIWIL1, PABPC1, and NONO, as revealed by coimmunoprecipitation and protein mass spectrometry. RNA electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay showed that these RBPs bind sperm-specific mRNAs, of which proteins are synthesized during the elongating stage of spermiogenesis. Biochemical and cell biological experiments demonstrated that PIWIL1, PABPC1, and NONO interact with each other and colocalize in spermatids' RNA granule, the chromatoid body. In addition, NONO was found in extracytoplasmic granules in round spermatids, whereas PIWIL1 and PABPC1 were diffusely localized in cytoplasm of elongating spermatids, indicating their participation at different steps of mRNA metabolism during spermatogenesis. Interestingly, type I PKA subunits colocalize with PIWIL1 and PABPC1 in the cytoplasm of elongating spermatids and cosediment with the RBPs in polysomal fractions on sucrose gradients. Further biochemical analyses revealed that activation of PKA positively regulates AKAP3 protein synthesis without changing its mRNA level in elongating spermatids. Taken together, these results indicate that PKA signaling directly participates in the regulation of protein translation in postmeiotic male germ cells, underscoring molecular mechanisms that regulate protein synthesis during mouse spermiogenesis.

TI Representations of texts and knowledge at Charles Estienne: the "lively
   word" of a humanist
SO RENAISSANCE AND REFORMATION
AB A man of much learning and a man of popularisation, Charles Estienne (1514-1564) was interested in theatrical translation and edition both in Latin and in French, as well as in many other editorial and scientific activities. Interest in theatre was at the centre of Charles Estienne's career consecrated to knowledge sharing; it manifested itself first in the French translation of a contemporary Italian comedy, re-edited at least twice. Then he produced several annotated editions for young people of a comedy by Terence, Andria. These were followed by the French translation of this same comedy, accompanied by a treatise on the Jeux des Anciens [Plays of the Ancients]. These two plays are representative of Charles Estienne's endeavour to make the great works of from classical past as well as contemporary Italy accessible to a wider public. Above all, these texts are designed for performance, in an educational context but also simply for the pleasure of theatrical spectacle. The rendering of the French, and the rendering of readability (through lexica, annotations, commentaries, abridgements etc.) stage the source text, which would be spoken during the performance but also stage its mediator, the populariser (who translated, edited, made comprehensible and disseminated the text). Thus translation for the stage illustrated a humanist position on the transmission and sharing of knowledge: a performance of revival and popularisation.

   GEISTESGESCHICHTE
AB The contribution is prompted by the observation that Goethe had deep insight into the temporal and legal problems of the (sic)tragedie classique,< which was fundamental to his work on the (sic)classical < drama. It was most likely the upheaval in the wake of the French Revolution that rendered the (sic)old < form more attractive. This is especially true for Die Naturliche Tochter. The play was, not coincidentally, written at the same time as Goethe's translations of two of Voltaire's dramas. Meanwhile, figurations of political foundation and legitimation had already advanced to the centre of (sic)classical < drama in Corneille's work. The enforced serene presentation of legitimate rule of the (sic)tragedie classique,< with its reference to the continuity of time and age-old (sic)habits,< was in massive tension with the normative demand for the (sic)unity < of time, which committed the drama to a disciplined economy of time - ideally even to a synchronization of time represented and the time of representation. Where Corneille attempted to either conceal or politically exploit such tensions, Goethe in Die Naturliche Tochter forces an insurmountable chasm between dramaturgy and the speech of the characters and consistently allows the original functions of the (sic)classical < economy of time to run dry. Thus, his drama does not pursue a restorative politics of form, but rather demonstrates the historical unassailability of the (sic)classical < form in the face of contemporary political developments.

TI Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase as a drug target in cancer, and in
   cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases
SO ACTA PHARMACOLOGICA SINICA
AB Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K) is an unusual protein kinase that regulates the elongation stage of protein synthesis by phosphorylating and inhibiting its only known substrate, eEF2. Elongation is a highly energy-consuming process, and eEF2K activity is tightly regulated by several signaling pathways. Regulating translation elongation can modulate the cellular energy demand and may also control the expression of specific proteins. Growing evidence links eEF2K to a range of human diseases, including cardiovascular conditions (atherosclerosis, via macrophage survival) and pulmonary arterial hypertension, as well as solid tumors, where eEF2K appears to play contrasting roles depending on tumor type and stage. eEF2K is also involved in neurological disorders and may be a valuable target in treating depression and certain neurodegenerative diseases. Because eEF2K is not required for mammalian development or cell viability, inhibiting its function may not elicit serious side effects, while the fact that it is an atypical kinase and quite distinct from the vast majority of other mammalian kinases suggests the possibility to develop it into compounds that inhibit eEF2K without affecting other important protein kinases. Further research is needed to explore these possibilities and there is an urgent need to identify and characterize potent and specific small-molecule inhibitors of eEF2K. In this article we review the recent evidence concerning the role of eEF2K in human diseases as well as the progress in developing small-molecule inhibitors of this enzyme.

AB The paper considers the activities of the prominent scientist Nikolai Ivanovich Ilminskiy in the education of the non-Russian peoples of the Volga and Ural regions. The attention is focused on the description of the key aspects of his pedagogical work which influenced the spiritual and moral development of the Udmurt people. The paper reveals that N. I. Ilminskiy was engaged in various activities: establishing the network of educational institutions for the Udmurts, developing the training programs and textbooks, and participating in translating the Orthodox texts into the Udmurt language. A detailed account is given of his methodology for teaching literacy to non-Russian peoples. The methodology developed by N. I. Ilminskiy was innovative for his time. Based on psychological and mental aspects, the educational system introduced by N. I. Ilminskiy was a universal project to teach peoples living in the Volga and Ural regions, Siberia, Central Asia and Kazakhstan. The author substantiates the idea that N. I. Ilminskiy could achieve impressive results thanks to his linguistic intuition. Creating the Orthodox Missionary Brotherhood of Saint Guriy in Kazan stimulated a new stage in the development of school education, translation projects and liturgical practices in the languages of peoples living in Eastern European Russia and Siberia. The author analyzes N. I. Ilminskiy's scholarly papers and reconstructs how he could translate some parts of the Bible into the Udmurt language. The paper also describes lexical, phonetical, graphical and orthographical features of the first Udmurt books which were written considering the scientific and methodological principles formulated by N. I. Ilminskiy. Hypotheses about neographisms used in those books are proposed. It was revealed that N. I. Ilminskiy's translations of liturgical literature were directly related to sacred music and contributed to the enlightenment of peoples being Christianized. Moreover, N. I. Ilminskiy actively supported people who became key figures playing a crucial role in the enlightenment of the Udmurts.

This article shows how the production conveyed notions of war, social upheaval, displacement, and exile that are relevant to contemporary Australian spectators. With its ethnic and racial diversity, and one overt reference to the plight of indigenous people under colonial rule and its legacy, the production confirmed that the emotional resonances in this staging of Antigone reflect and yet transcend the contemporary Australian situation; and Peta Tait here argues that the production contributed to spectators' understanding of the emotions underlying contemporary political debates. Peta Tait is Professor of Theatre and Drama at La Trobe University. Her recent publications include Circus Bodies: Cultural Identity in Aerial Performance (Rout ledge, 2005) and Performing Emotions: Gender, Bodies, Spaces (Ashgate, 2002). She has published widely on theatre, drama, circus performance, and gender identity, and is co-editor (with Liz Schafer) of the anthology Australian Women's Drama: Texts and Feminisms (Currency Press, 1997).

TI Ivan Grevs Interpretation of Works by Romain Rolland at the Beginning of
   the 20th Century
SO ISTORIYA-ELEKTRONNYI NAUCHNO-OBRAZOVATELNYI ZHURNAL
AB Medievalist Ivan Mikhailovich Grevs (1860-1941) in addition to teaching medieval history in higher and secondary educational institutions of St. Petersburg-Petrograd-Leningrad and a significant contribution to theoretical and practical excursion studies and historical local history, perfectly mastered classical, new European languages and was engaged in translations. In historiography, dedicated to the person and the activities of the scientist (works of E. Ch. Skrzhinskaya, V. P. Buzeskul, M. E. Sergeenko, M. A. Alpatov, V. I. Rutenburg, E. D. Frolov, S. N. Valk, B. S. Kaganovich, O. B. Vrasskaya, F. F. Perchenko, A. V. Kreutzer, A. I. Dobkin, K. V. Gersh, A. V. Sveshnikov and others), there are practically no studies analyzing his translated works.This article is intended to contribute to the history of the study of the biography of I. M. Grevs important changes. It was created on the basis of the publication of the unfinished manuscript of the professor and the commentary of the author of 2017 (I. M. Grevs. The Personality and Case of Romain Rolland. Experience in the interpretation of the soul), timed to the 100th anniversary of its writing.Ivan Mikhailovich received his first translation literary experience in the Circle of Literary Evenings in the gymnasium period (1872-1879). His attentive mentor was a teacher of literature and subsequently a friend of Grevs, V. P. Ostrogorsky. The circle was visited by members of the Oldenburg Circle (brothers F. F. and S. F. Oldenburg, D. I. Shakhovskoy, A. A. Kornilov, L. A. Obolyaninov, N. G. Ushinskiy, A. N. Krasnov, N .V. Kharlamov and V. I. Vernadskiy - who later called themselves members of the university, Priyutinsky fraternity). I. M. Grevs translated the play The Venetian Merchant; it was published and became his first print work. (Grevs I. M. The Merchant of Venice (by Shakespeare) // Child Reading / edited by V. P. Ostrogorsky. T. XXV. 1880. P. 1-39). The gymnasium has grown into a professional occupation. Evidence of this are the translations of works by Romain Rolland, still unknown to the Russian public. For the Gorky publishing house, Grevs made several more literary translations of works by foreign authors, but they also did not see the light: Goethe's political drama Rebellious, Abelard's "History of my calamities".I. M. Greys was an unsurpassed author of biographies, which made a significant contribution to the development of the science of "biographies". He was always attracted by large individuals, geniuses (Tacitus, Augustine, Francis of Assisi, Dante, Rolland, and others), he called such - "exemplary carriers", "spiritually meaningful figures", "seekers of truth" and "creative engines" of culture. Moreover, the interest of the historian was caused by those personalities, which reflected the contradictory nature of transitional periods.Turning to the image and texts of the great French writer Romain Rolland (1866-1944), he wanted to enrich the Slavic culture with the "Latin genius". The structure of the historian's manuscript resembles a study that allows its author to improvise in many respects on the theme of R. Rolland's literary work in combination with his biography. This form of presentation of the material shows what Rolland is "good and great", and the historian reveals himself as a deep explorer of culture. Opening the "world of Rolland", Greys did not argue with him and did not engage in criticism, he followed closely with the "word of Rolland", giving an assessment of the work and instrument of the great Frenchman.

TI Allogeneic Mesenchymal Stem Cells Stimulate Cartilage Regeneration and
   Are Safe for Single-Stage Cartilage Repair in Humans upon Mixture with
   Recycled Autologous Chondrons
SO STEM CELLS
AB Traditionally, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from adult bone marrow were described as being capable of differentiating to various lineages including cartilage. Despite increasing interest in these MSCs, concerns regarding their safety, in vivo behavior and clinical effectiveness have restrained their clinical application. We hypothesized that MSCs have trophic effects that stimulate recycled chondrons (chondrocytes with their native pericellular matrix) to regenerate cartilage. Searching for a proof of principle, this phase I (first-in-man) clinical trial applied allogeneic MSCs mixed with either 10% or 20% recycled autologous cartilage-derived cells (chondrons) for treatment of cartilage defects in the knee in symptomatic cartilage defect patients. This unique first in man series demonstrated no treatment-related adverse events up to one year postoperatively. At 12 months, all patients showed statistically significant improvement in clinical outcome compared to baseline. Magnetic resonance imaging and second-look arthroscopies showed completely filled defects with regenerative cartilage tissue. Histological analysis on biopsies of the grafts indicated hyaline-like regeneration with a high concentration of proteoglycans and type II collagen. Short tandem repeat analysis showed the regenerative tissue only contained patient-own DNA. These findings support the novel insight that the use of allogeneic MSCs is safe and opens opportunities for other applications. Stem cell-induced paracrine mechanisms may play an important role in the chondrogenesis and successful tissue regeneration found.

TI Supporting innovation processes using material artefacts: Comparing the
   use of LEGO bricks and moderation cards as boundary objects
SO CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION MANAGEMENT
AB Various collaborative innovation methods are increasingly used in strategy development and the implementation of organizational challenges. The aim of applying them is to involve different agents of an organization and support them in generating new ideas in a joint effort. For this research, an experimental field study was conducted in the course of an innovation workshop for 80 top managers in the public sector using a quantitative questionnaire and an ethnographic observation. A novel workshop format was designed using different materials to support the beginning of this innovation process. The groups used either traditional workshop materials, that is, moderation cards (small sheets of colored paper), or novel workshop materials, that is, LEGO bricks. Our results show that both materials significantly influenced the human experience in the workshop. The use of LEGO bricks was perceived as more enjoyable, active, and inspiring than the use of moderation cards. However, the perceived group outcome using moderation cards was rated higher than that working with LEGO bricks. We discuss how using novel workshop materials changes the experience of an innovation workshop, but we also highlight that additional factors, including translation effects, trained facilitators, and specific innovation phases, must be considered to outperform the use of traditional materials.

TI Comparative Analysis of Proteome-Wide Lysine Acetylation in Juvenile and
   Adult Schistosoma japonicum
SO FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB Schistosomiasis is a devastating parasitic disease caused by tremotodes of the genus Schistosoma. Eggs produced by sexually mature schistosomes are the causative agents of for pathogenesis and transmission. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of schistosome development and sexual maturation would facilitate the prevention and control of schistosomiasis. Acetylation of lysine is a dynamic and reversible post-translational modification playing keys role in many biological processes including development in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. To investigate the impacts of lysine acetylation on Schistosoma japonicum (S. japonicum) development and sexual maturation, we used immunoaffinity-based acetyllysine peptide enrichment combined with mass spectrometry (MS), to perform the first comparative analysis of proteome-wide lysine acetylation in both female and male, juvenile (18 days post infection, 18 dpi) and adult (28 dpi) schistosome samples. In total, we identified 874 unique acetylated sites in 494 acetylated proteins. The four samples shared 47 acetylated sites and 46 proteins. More acetylated sites and proteins shared by both females and males were identified in 28 dpi adults (189 and 143, respectively) than in 18 dpi schistosomula (76 and 59, respectively). More stage-unique acetylated sites and proteins were also identified in 28 dpi adults (494 and 210, respectively) than in 18 dpi schistosomula (73 and 44, respectively). Functional annotation showed that in different developmental stages and genders, a number of proteins involving in muscle movement, glycometabolism, lipid metabolism, energy metabolism, environmental stress resistance, antioxidation, etc., displayed distinct acetylation profiles, which was in accordance with the changes of their biological functions during schistosome development, suggesting that lysine acetylation modification exerted important regulatory roles in schistosome development. Taken together, our data provided the first comparative global survey of lysine acetylation in juvenile and adult S. japonicum, which would deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanism of schistosome development and sexual maturation, and provide clues for the development of new anti-schistosome strategies.

TI Literature in Spanish as a Foreign Language (SFL): A journey from its
   early stages to the xxi century
SO CIRCULO DE LINGUISTICA APLICADA A LA COMUNICACION
AB Literature has experienced significant ups and downs in terms of its presence and prominence in the most relevant methods and approaches followed in the process of teaching-learning languages from its beginnings to present times. In some of them, literature has played an important role (grammar translation method), while it has been clearly ignored in others (natural methods, structural methods) or it has been received with a certain coolness, at least in its beginnings (communicative approach). In this paper, a diachronic tour is taken regarding the relationship between methodologies and literature in teaching a second language, at the same time that its function and treatment is analized in the complete series of eight current Spanish as a Foreign Language (SFL) textbooks. The analyzed variables are the number of literary texts related to the number of didactic units and to the levels of The Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR), the degree of integration of literary texts into those units and the type of exploitation proposed. The results show that the steps taken compared to other times are important, but that the literary texts are quite often still conceived as very suitable resources to be introduced in sections of a complementary nature instead of being fully integrated in the didactic units.

TI Polemic Prologues Voltaire in the 18th Century National Theatre
SO DEUTSCHE VIERTELJAHRSSCHRIFT FUR LITERATURWISSENSCHAFT UND
   GEISTESGESCHICHTE
AB Since antiquity, prologues are an opportunity to specify adaptations and translations, as well as to be polemical. In the 18th century, both these traditions merge into a new form: translation polemics in prologues. Such polemics, I want to argue in this paper, serve as a cultural and political medium of nation-building. This process becomes apparent in the reception of Voltaire in German-speaking theatre, particularly when it is mediated through English drama. The national antagonisms that are found in English Voltaire translations (Hill, Miller) recur in prominent text such as Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's Hamburg Dramaturgy and Friedrich Schiller's prologue To Goethe, On His Producing Voltaire's >> Mahomet << On The Stage in an effort to break new ground for German national theatre.

TI Expression of eIF6 and its relationship with cell proliferation in
   colorectal adenocarcinoma
SO ONCOLOGIE
AB Objectives: Eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) are genes related to tumor formation. They selectively translate some mRNAs, regulate protein synthesis, promote cell proliferation, and effectively control the progression of some tumors. As a member of this family, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 6 (eIF6) plays a crucial role in tumor formation and progression. Exploring the expression characteristics of eIF6 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a proliferation-associated factor, in colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRAC) and analyzing their correlation and clinical significance can provide a theoretical basis for the study of CRAC and objective biological indicators for the clinical judgment of tumor formation and progression.Methods: The GEPIA database was used to predict the trend of eIF6 and PCNA in CRAC. Sixty-four patients diagnosed with CRAC and undergoing surgical treatment were selected from January 2017 to November 2022. CRAC tissues and normal mucous tissues (>3 cm away from the tumor margin) were retained. The expression of eIF6 and PCNA was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Colon cancer cell lines SW480, HCT15, and SW620 and normal colon cell line NCM460 were selected, and the expression of eFI6 and PCNA in these cells was detected by Western blot.Results: A trend of elevated expression of eIF6 and PCNA was predicted in CRAC by the GEPIA database. The expression levels of eIF6 (65.63 % vs. 9.38 %, X-2=43.2000, p<0.0001) and PCNA (84.38 % vs. 46.88 %, X-2=19.9481, p<0.0001) were higher in CRAC tissues than that in normal mucosa as indicated by IHC. Significant difference in eIF6 and PCNA expression was found among different maxim tumor diameters and depths of infiltration in colon adenocarcinoma (p<0.05). No statistical difference in eIF6 and PCNA expression was observed among different genders, ages, degrees of differentiation, LNMets, intravascular cancer thrombosis, TNM stages, and numbers of lymph node metastases (p>0.05). A positive correlation was found between eIF6 and PCNA in CRAC (X-2=5.05, r=0.77, p=0.0283). Their expression was significantly higher in SW480, HCT15, and SW620 than in NCM460 (p<0.05).Conclusions: eIF6 is highly expressed in CRAC, participates in tumor formation and progression, and has a positive correlation with PCNA.

TI Narrative as a learning tool for coaches of athletes with a disability:
   using stories to translate research into practice
SO PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND SPORT PEDAGOGY
AB Background Provided that coaches play a key role in shaping the sport experiences of athletes with a disability, they represent an important point of intervention for enhancing the quality of athletes' participation in disability sport. Despite the importance of their role, few evidence-informed learning resources are available to support the development of disability sport coaches. Purpose The purpose of this study was to produce a novel evidence-informed learning tool for disability sport coaches in entry level and developmental coaching domains. The goal of this tool was to demonstrate and provide information about coach behaviours that facilitate quality experiences for athletes with disabilities. Methodology The format selected for this tool was a creative nonfiction (i.e. an evidence-informed story). Using the Knowledge to Action Framework as a guide, the tool was developed through a four-stage process: (1) identifying and creating primary sources of knowledge through a literature review and original research; (2) synthesizing primary sources of knowledge to select target behaviours and behavioural determinants; (3) crafting the story to demonstrate and provide information about target behaviours and related outcomes; and (4) obtaining feedback from stakeholders (i.e. disability sport athletes, coaches, and administrators) to tailor the knowledge included in the story to the appropriate context. Findings In the first stage, 23 studies focused on quality experiences and/or coaches in disability sport were identified through a review of the literature. The findings of these studies were combined with the results of three original studies conducted by the research team. A synthesis of these findings resulted in the selection of two behavioural determinants (confidence and attitudes) and 13 coach behaviours (aligning with transformational leadership theory) for inclusion in the tool (Stage 2). The story that formed the basis for the tool was crafted in Stage 3, which combined the behaviours and behavioural determinants identified in Stage 2 with a plotline, setting, and characters based on the experience of the first author and stakeholder input. The tool was revised several times to incorporate stakeholder feedback in Stage 4. Implications This paper describes the development of a practical resource for coaches and coach educators in disability sport. As such, we provide a detailed and rigorous procedure for translating evidence into a narrative format with the potential for application in diverse learning contexts. In addition, we reviewed and synthesized evidence that may contribute to enhanced theoretical understandings of coaching effectiveness in disability sport. Taken together, the information presented in this paper offers important theoretical, methodological, and practical implications for researchers, coaches, and coach developers in disability sport.

TI Hard to Be a Jew in Mandatory Tel Aviv: Relocating the Eastern European
   Jewish Experience
SO JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES
AB This article addresses two Hebrew stage adaptations based on Sholem Aleichem's Der blutike shpas (The Bloody Hoax) produced in Mandatory Palestine: Hard to Be a Jew, which premiered at Habima in December 1936, and a parody of this play, titled Easy to Be a Jew, which premiered at Ha-matateh, the satirical Yishuv theater company, in June 1937. These production s constituted a symbolic zone of boundary-work between the Yiddish culture associated with the old home in eastern Europe and the Hebrew culture of Zionist Palestine, encapsulating the eastern European Jewish experience on the stage. The stage performances and reception of the plays indicate that the experience of the new land and the sense of communal belonging to the Zionist collective was fashioned after this encapsulated model of Jewish experience in eastern Europe. Thus, the adaptation of Zionist cultural identity was marked as being continuous with the old world, rather than rebellion against it or its radical transformation.

TI Enacting Ethnicity: Yiddishkeit Masked and Unmasked on the Contemporary

SO JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES
AB Two recent productions of American dramas employed provocative strategies for enacting Jewish ethnicity: National Asian American Theatre Company's performance of Clifford Odets's Awake and Sing! with an all-Asian American cast and New Yiddish Rep's staging of Toyt fun a seylsman, a Yiddish translation of Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman. Each production entails a different approach to performing Jewishness that exemplifies these companies' respective artistic agendas regarding the enactment of ethnicity, resulting in complex performances of masking and unmasking Jewishness. Moreover, their analysis illuminates how ethnicity is conceptualized and realized in the United States in the early decades of the twenty-first century. Yiddish appears strategically, if often obliquely, in the histories of composition, production, and reception for both dramas, emblematic of shifting notions of enacting ethnicity.

TI Postures of Dying: Eliot, Seneca and the Elizabethans
SO REVIEW OF ENGLISH STUDIES
AB This article analyses the substantial intertextual relations between Eliot's 'Gerontion', Seneca's tragedies, and Elizabethan and Jacobean drama, particularly in the depictions of dying speeches. It demonstrates, too, that 'Gerontion' is a prominent example of how Eliot's poetry anticipates the issues explored in his critical prose-in this case, notably 'Shakespeare and the Stoicism of Seneca' and 'Seneca in Elizabethan Translation'. Further, the article relates the use of what Eliot called 'saturated' images in early modern drama and his own poetry with his theories of poetic creation and originality. In so doing, it argues that, contrary to the accepted critical narrative, the famous description of a 'profound kinship' with an unnamed 'dead author' that Eliot describes in 'Reflections on Contemporary Poetry', may not primarily and exclusively refer to Jules Laforgue.

TI Mettl3-/Mettl14-mediated mRNA N-6-methyladenosine modulates murine
   spermatogenesis
SO CELL RESEARCH
AB Spermatogenesis is a differentiation process during which diploid spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) produce haploid spermatozoa. This highly specialized process is precisely controlled at the transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and translational levels. Here we report that N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A), an epitranscriptomic mark regulating gene expression, plays essential roles during spermatogenesis. We present comprehensive m(6)A mRNA methylomes of mouse spermatogenic cells from five developmental stages: undifferentiated spermatogonia, type A(1) spermatogonia, preleptotene spermatocytes, pachytene/diplotene spermatocytes, and round spermatids. Germ cell-specific inactivation of the m(6)A RNA methyltransferase Mettl3 or Mettl14 with Vasa-Cre causes loss of m(6)A and depletion of SSCs. m(6)A depletion dysregulates translation of transcripts that are required for SSC proliferation/differentiation. Combined deletion of Mettl3 and Mettl14 in advanced germ cells with Stra8-GFPCre disrupts spermiogenesis, whereas mice with single deletion of either Mettl3 or Mettl14 in advanced germ cells show normal spermatogenesis. The spermatids from double-mutant mice exhibit impaired translation of haploid-specific genes that are essential for spermiogenesis. This study highlights crucial roles of mRNA m(6)A modification in germline development, potentially ensuring coordinated translation at different stages of spermatogenesis.

TI Chromatoid Bodies in the Regulation of Spermatogenesis: Novel Role of
   GRTH
SO CELLS
AB Post-transcriptional and translational control of specialized genes play a critical role in the progression of spermatogenesis. During the early stages, mRNAs are actively transcribed and stored, temporarily bound to RNA binding proteins in chromatoid bodies (CBs). CBs are membrane-less dynamic organelles which serve as storehouses and processing centers of mRNAs awaiting translation during later stages of spermatogenesis. These CBs can also regulate the stability of mRNAs to secure the correct timing of protein expression at different stages of sperm formation. Gonadotropin-regulated testicular RNA helicase (GRTH/DDX25) is an essential regulator of spermatogenesis. GRTH transports mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and phospho-GRTH transports mRNAs from the cytoplasm to the CBs. During spermiogenesis, there is precise control of mRNAs transported by GRTH from and to the CBs, directing the timing of translation of critical proteins which are involved in spermatid elongation and acrosomal development, resulting in functional sperm formation. This chapter presents our current knowledge on the role of GRTH, phospho-GRTH and CBs in the control of spermiogenesis. In addition, it covers the components of CBs compared to those of stress granules and P-bodies.

TI Androgen upregulates the palmitoylation of eIF3L in human prostate LNCaP
   cells
SO ONCOTARGETS AND THERAPY
AB Background: Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Western countries. Most patients diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer can be treated with the main treatment: androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The androgen receptor (AR) signaling axis plays a pivotal role in the progression of prostate cancer. However, most patients can ultimately progress to the castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) stage within 2 years. At this stage, drugs targeting the AR signaling axis, including enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate, cannot prevent the progression of prostate cancer, thus predicting a poor prognosis. The molecular mechanism lies in the aberrant AR reactivation, which exhibits an adaptive response to ADT, such as the presence of AR splice variants. Thus, CRPC treatment remains a challenge.
   Purpose: In addition to the AR axis, a mechanism leading to this progression should be determined. The present study mainly compared palmitoylated proteins between androgentreated LNCaP cells and non-treated LNCaP cells by palmitoylome profiling, to illustrate the changes at proteomic levels.
   Materials and methods: To screen the androgen-induced palmitoylated proteins, we conducted proteomic experiments using clickable palmitate probe (Alk-C16) between three individual pairs of androgen-treated and non-treated LNCaP cells.
   Results: We identified 4351 unique peptides corresponding to 835 proteins, among them a number of these identified proteins were palmitoylated proteins, particularly eIF3L. Androgen treatment significantly increased the palmitoylation level of eIF3L, an individual subunit of eIF3. As an initiation factor, eIF3L plays a pivotal role in the translation of mRNAs encoding growth-promoting proteins by enhancing translation rates, thus controlling cell proliferation.
   Conclusion: In this study, we demonstrated that the regulation of eIF3L palmitoylation may provide new directions for the therapy of prostate cancer. Moreover, the increased level of androgen-induced eIF3L may be used as a biomarker for the diagnosis of early-stage prostate cancer.

TI A game of English make-believe: Reading eighteenth-century French
   pseudotranslations
SO TRANSLATION STUDIES
AB Recent research on pseudotranslations demonstrates the aesthetic, political and socio-cultural purposes these texts served throughout history; yet their recurrent metafictional play on reading has not been addressed before. This article argues that it is precisely by looking at the paratextual discourse on reading - and how it is received by both critics and translators - that one gains a better insight into the specific functioning of pseudotranslation within a given historical context. The various forms and functions of this self-reflective discourse are analysed by examining, firstly, how it was staged in the paratextual framework of two eighteenth-century novels; and secondly, how (French) critics and (German and English) translators playfully picked up on the make-believe. The sometimes conflicting paratextual markers set out through the staging of various forms of reading and interpretation thus reveal a literary context where texts could be presented as originals and translations, allowing the reader to navigate freely between both.

TI HOW O'NEILL'S IRISHNESS TRANSLATES FOR THE CHINESE
SO EUGENE O NEILL REVIEW
AB "The one thing that explains more than anything about me is the fact that I'm Irish," Eugene O'Neill informed his son Eugene Jr. in 1946. "And, strangely enough, it is something that all the writers who have attempted to explain me and my work have overlooked." As the translator of Robert Dowling's Eugene O'Neill: A Life in Four Acts, I have been trying to convey to Chinese readers the Irish aspect of Eugene O'Neill, whose plays, although widely translated and staged in China, have been mostly studied as those of a well-known American playwright. In this article, examples will be taken from the author-translator collaboration to convey O'Neill's Irishness in the best possible way. I hope Chinese readers, when reading the Chinese version of the biography, may also feel Ireland as the constant presence.

TI Silenos' Monuments of Bravery
SO HERMES-ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KLASSISCHE PHILOLOGIE
AB In Sophocles' Ichneutai Silenos reproaches the Satyrs for their cowardice. Among other things that he says to them, he contrasts their current attitude to his own bravery in youth; in lines 154-155 he speaks of many monuments of bravery, which he has left in the homes of the nymphs. After illustrating the syntax of these lines and offering a new translation, the author goes on to investigate the possible reference of these "monuments of bravery" and hence of the (alleged) exploits of Silenos.

TI Fate, Experience and Tragedy in Simmel's Dialogue with Modernity
SO THEORY CULTURE & SOCIETY
AB This article explores the neglected idea of fate in Simmel's thought. It examines the specific definition of fate present in Simmel's writings and the relation of this definition to tragic drama. The argument operates under the assumption that tragic drama represents the 'natural habitat' for the exploration and expression of the fate problematic. In this context, it is argued that Simmel's rediscovery of the relevance of fate emphasizes the modernity of tragedy. The article explores Simmel's translation of fate from drama and philosophy into sociology, but into a sociology replete with a distinctly existential and metaphysical consciousness. It is argued that Simmel's application of fate to modern social life constitutes a sociologization of fate, but that rather than involving a reduction of fate to society, this sociologization actually involves a form of re-enchantment of the social through life. In relation to this sociologization and building on the argument of Peter Baehr, it is argued that the concept of fate is uniquely endowed with a capacity to encourage a sense of pathos conducive to the development of a reflexive and critical sense of collective social responsibility and of shared future. In this regard, the article examines Simmel's engagement with Naturalist tragedy and the transition from ancient to modern drama. Throughout, it is argued that the experience of modernity, where 'all that is solid melts into air', is conducive to a rediscovery of the relevance of fate and tragedy.

AB Global economies and digital diasporas have led to a rise in fansubbing sites, one of the largest being Viki. Viki uses amateur expert fans to translate media from around the world into over two hundred languages. Global markets and for-profit fansubbing companies encourage volunteers to establish their own work practices. In examining the posts to one large segmenting forum, this article identifies ways Viki segmenters adapt workplace practices to online fan communities as well as ways that volunteers adapt localized community practices to online spaces. Specifically, volunteers adopted localized professional work etiquette to online leisure activities. This research expands understandings of global fan communities, referencing ways localized community practices continue to intersect with understandings of online work and leisure.

TI Translational Control in Plasmodium and Toxoplasma Parasites
SO EUKARYOTIC CELL
AB The life cycles of apicomplexan parasites such as Plasmodium spp. and Toxoplasma gondii are complex, consisting of proliferative and latent stages within multiple hosts. Dramatic transformations take place during the cycles, and they demand precise control of gene expression at all levels, including translation. This review focuses on the mechanisms that regulate translational control in Plasmodium and Toxoplasma, with a particular emphasis on the phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2 alpha). Phosphorylation of eIF2 alpha (eIF2 alpha similar to P) is a conserved mechanism that eukaryotic cells use to repress global protein synthesis while enhancing gene-specific translation of a subset of mRNAs. Elevated levels of eIF2 alpha similar to P have been observed during latent stages in both Toxoplasma and Plasmodium, indicating that translational control plays a role in maintaining dormancy. Parasite-specific eIF2 alpha kinases and phosphatases are also required for proper developmental transitions and adaptation to cellular stresses encountered during the life cycle. Identification of small-molecule inhibitors of apicomplexan eIF2 alpha kinases may selectively interfere with parasite translational control and lead to the development of new therapies to treat malaria and toxoplasmosis.

TI Hiding in plain sight: communication theory in implementation science
SO IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE
AB Background: Poor communication among healthcare professionals is a pressing problem, contributing to widespread barriers to patient safety. The word "communication" means to share or make common. In the literature, two communication paradigms dominate: (1) communication as a transactional process responsible for information exchange, and (2) communication as a transformational process responsible for causing change. Implementation science has focused on information exchange attributes while largely ignoring transformational attributes of communication. In this paper, we debate the merits of encompassing both paradigms.
   Discussion: We conducted a two-staged literature review searching for the concept of communication in implementation science to understand how communication is conceptualized. Twenty-seven theories, models, or frameworks were identified; only Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations theory provides a definition of communication and includes both communication paradigms. Most models (notable exceptions include Diffusion of Innovations, The Ottawa Model of Research Use, and Normalization Process Theory) describe communication as a transactional process. But thinking of communication solely as information transfer or exchange misrepresents reality. We recommend that implementation science theories (1) propose and test the concept of shared understanding when describing communication, (2) acknowledge that communication is multi-layered, identify at least a few layers, and posit how identified layers might affect the development of shared understanding, (3) acknowledge that communication occurs in a social context, providing a frame of reference for both individuals and groups, (4) acknowledge the unpredictability of communication (and healthcare processes in general), and (5) engage with and draw on work done by communication theorists.
   Summary: Implementation science literature has conceptualized communication as a transactional process (when communication has been mentioned at all), thereby ignoring a key contributor to implementation intervention success. When conceptualized as a transformational process, the focus of communication moves to shared understanding and is grounded in human interactions and the way we go about constructing knowledge. Instead of hiding in plain sight, we suggest explicitly acknowledging the role that communication plays in our implementation efforts. By using both paradigms, we can investigate when communication facilitates implementation, when it does not, and how to improve it so that our implementation and clinical interventions are embraced by clinicians and patients alike.

TI The functional role of the C-terminal tail of the human ribosomal
   protein uS19
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-GENE REGULATORY MECHANISMS
AB The eukaryotic ribosomal protein uS19 has a C-terminal tail that is absent in its bacterial homologue. This tail has been shown to be involved in the formation of the decoding site of human ribosomes. We studied here the previously unexplored functional significance of the 15 C-terminal amino acid residues of human uS19 for the assembly of ribosomes and translation using HEK293-based cell cultures capable of producing FLAG-labeled uS19 (uS19(FLAG)) or its mutant form deprived of the mentioned amino acid ones. The examination of polysome profiles of cytoplasmic extracts from the respective cells revealed that the deletion of the above uS19 amino acid residues barely affected the assembly and maturation of 40S subunits and the initiation of translation, but completely prevented the formation of polysomes. This implied the crucial importance of the uS19 tail in the elongation process. Analysis of tRNAs associated with 40S subunits and 80S ribosomes containing wild type uS19(FLAG) or its truncated form showed that the deletion of the C-terminal pentadecapeptide fragment of uS19 did not interfere with the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) at the ribosomal A site. The results led to the conclusion that the transpeptidation, which occurs on the large ribosomal subunit after decoding the A site codon by the incoming aa-tRNA, is the most likely elongation stage, where this uS19 fragment can play a critical role. Our findings suggest that the uS19 tail is a keystone player in the accommodation of aa-tRNA at the A site, which is a pre-requisite for the peptide transfer.

After introducing the elements and their relevance in the colloquial mode, both in English (following Biber et al., 1999; Carter & McCarthy, 2006) and Spanish (Briz, 2001), the paper will consider whether dysfluencies are a common feature of contemporary audiovisual fiction in English (Quaglio, 2009). Then, the first seasons of the American dramas The West Wing and Brothers and Sisters will be examined to decide whether these elements are present in Anglophone texts. The Spanish dubbed versions will be compared, and a Spanish original series will be used as control. The paper will conclude with a discussion of the findings.

In particular, it examines the need for such services and the duties and the tasks the translators and the interpreters were forced to execute. It is based on archival material, in particular the recollections and the statements of former inmates collected in the archives of concentration camps. The ontological narratives are compared with the cinematic figure of Marta Weiss, a camp interpreter, as presented in the docudrama "Ostatni Etap" ("The last Stage") of 1948 by the Polish director Wanda Jakubowska, herself a former prisoner of the concentration camp. The article contributes to the discussion on the role that translators and interpreters play in extreme and violent situations when the ethics of interpreting and translation loses its power and the generally accepted norms and standards are no longer applicable.

TI The Transacting Factor CBF-A/Hnrnpab Binds to the A2RE/RTS Element of
   Protamine 2 mRNA and Contributes to Its Translational Regulation during
   Mouse Spermatogenesis
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB During spermatogenesis, mRNA localization and translation are believed to be regulated in a stage-specific manner. We report here that the Protamine2 (Prm2) mRNA transits through chromatoid bodies of round spermatids and localizes to cytosol of elongating spermatids for translation. The transacting factor CBF-A, also termed Hnrnpab, contributes to temporal regulation of Prm2 translation. We found that CBF-A co-localizes with the Prm2 mRNA during spermatogenesis, directly binding to the A2RE/RTS element in the 3' UTR. Although both p37 and p42 CBF-A isoforms interacted with RTS, they associated with translationally repressed and de-repressed Prm2 mRNA, respectively. Only p42 was found to interact with the 5' cap complex, and to co-sediment with the Prm2 mRNA in polysomes. In CBF-A knockout mice, expression of protamine 2 (PRM2) was reduced and the Prm2 mRNA was prematurely translated in a subset of elongating spermatids. Moreover, a high percentage of sperm from the CBF-A knockout mouse showed abnormal DNA morphology. We suggest that CBF-A plays an important role in spermatogenesis by regulating stage-specific translation of testicular mRNAs.

TI N-6-methyladenosine modification and the YTHDF2 reader protein play cell
   type specific roles in lytic viral gene expression during Kaposi's
   sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection
SO PLOS PATHOGENS
AB Methylation at the N-6 position of adenosine (m(6)A) is a highly prevalent and reversible modification within eukaryotic mRNAs that has been linked to many stages of RNA processing and fate. Recent studies suggest that m6A deposition and proteins involved in the m(6)A pathway play a diverse set of roles in either restricting or modulating the lifecycles of select viruses. Here, we report that m(6)A levels are significantly increased in cells infected with the oncogenic human DNA virus Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Transcriptome-wide m(6)A-sequencing of the KSHV-positive renal carcinoma cell line iSLK.219 during lytic reactivation revealed the presence of m(6)A across multiple kinetic classes of viral transcripts, and a concomitant decrease in m(6)A levels across much of the host transcriptome. However, we found that depletion of the m(6)A machinery had differential pro-and anti-viral impacts on viral gene expression depending on the cell-type analyzed. In iSLK. 219 and iSLK.BAC16 cells the pathway functioned in a pro-viral manner, as depletion of the m(6)A writer METTL3 and the reader YTHDF2 significantly impaired virion production. In iSLK. 219 cells the defect was linked to their roles in the post-transcriptional accumulation of the major viral lytic transactivator ORF50, which is m(6)A modified. In contrast, although the ORF50 mRNA was also m(6)A modified in KSHV infected B cells, ORF50 protein expression was instead increased upon depletion of METTL3, or, to a lesser extent, YTHDF2. These results highlight that the m(6)A pathway is centrally involved in regulating KSHV gene expression, and underscore how the outcome of this dynamically regulated modification can vary significantly between cell types.

TI The rice ALS3 encoding a novel pentatricopeptide repeat protein is
   required for chloroplast development and seedling growth
SO RICE
AB Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins play essential roles in modulating the expression of organelle genes and have expanded greatly in higher plants. However, molecular mechanisms of most rice PPR genes remain unclear.
   In this study, a new rice PPR mutant, asl3 (albino seedling lethality3) exhibits an albino lethal phenotype at the seedling stage. This albino phenotype was associated with altered photosynthetic-pigment and chloroplast development. Map-based cloning showed that ASL3 encodes a novel rice PPR protein with 10 tandem PPR motifs, which localizes to the chloroplast. ASL3 showed tissue-specific expression, as it was highly expressed in the chlorenchyma, but expressed at much lower levels in roots and panicles. RNAi of ASL3 confirmed that ASL3 plays an essential role in the early development and chloroplast development in rice. Moreover, expression analysis revealed that the asl3 mutation severely affected the transcriptional levels of important genes associated with plastid translation machinery and photosynthesis, which may impair photosynthesis and finally led to the seedling death in asl3 mutant. These results evidenced the important role of ASL3 in the early development of rice, especially chloroplast development.
   The ASL3 gene encoded a novel chloroplast-targeted PPR protein with 10 tandem PPR motifs in rice. Disruption of the ASL3 would lead to a defective chloroplast and seedling lethality, and affected expression levels of genes associated with chloroplast development and photosynthesis at early leaf stage of rice.

TI Utilizing Human-to-Human Conversation Examples for a Multi Domain
   Chat-Oriented Dialog System
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB This paper describes the design and evaluation of a method for developing a chat-oriented dialog system by utilizing real human-to-human conversation examples from movie scripts and Twitter conversations. The aim of the proposed method is to build a conversational agent that can interact with users in as natural a fashion as possible, while reducing the time requirement for database design and collection. A number of the challenging design issues we faced are described, including (1) constructing an appropriate dialog corpora from raw movie scripts and Twitter data, and (2) developing an multi domain chat-oriented dialog management system which can retrieve a proper system response based on the current user query. To build a dialog corpus, we propose a unit of conversation called a tri-turn (a trigram conversation turn), as well as extraction and semantic similarity analysis techniques to help ensure that the content extracted from raw movie/drama script files forms appropriate dialog-pair (query-response) examples. The constructed dialog corpora are then utilized in a data-driven dialog management system. Here, various approaches are investigated including example-based (EBDM) and response generation using phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT). In particular, we use two EBDM: syntactic-semantic similarity retrieval and TF-IDF based cosine similarity retrieval. Experiments are conducted to compare and contrast EBDM and SMT approaches in building a chat-oriented dialog system, and we investigate a combined method that addresses the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches. System performance was evaluated based on objective metrics (semantic similarity and cosine similarity) and human subjective evaluation from a small user study. Experimental results show that the proposed filtering approach effectively improve the performance. Furthermore, the results also show that by combing both EBDM and SMT approaches, we could overcome the shortcomings of each.

TI The coupling of transcriptome and proteome adaptation during development
   and heat stress response of tomato pollen
SO BMC GENOMICS
AB Background: Pollen development is central for plant reproduction and is assisted by changes of the transcriptome and proteome. At the same time, pollen development and viability is largely sensitive to stress, particularly to elevated temperatures. The transcriptomic and proteomic changes during pollen development and of different stages in response to elevated temperature was targeted to define the underlying molecular principles.
   Results: The analysis of the transcriptome and proteome of Solanum lycopersicum pollen at tetrad, post-meiotic and mature stage before and after heat stress yielded a decline of the transcriptome but an increase of the proteome size throughout pollen development Comparison of the transcriptome and proteome led to the discovery of two modes defined as direct and delayed translation. Here, genes of distinct functional processes are under the control of direct and delayed translation. The response of pollen to elevated temperature occurs rather at proteome, but not as drastic at the transcriptome level. Heat shock proteins, proteasome subunits, ribosomal proteins and eukaryotic initiation factors are most affected. On the example of heat shock proteins we demonstrate a decoupling of transcript and protein levels as well as a distinct regulation between the developmental stages.
   Conclusions: The transcriptome and proteome of developing pollen undergo drastic changes in composition and quantity. Changes at the proteome level are a result of two modes assigned as direct and delayed translation. The response of pollen to elevated temperature is mainly regulated at the proteome level, whereby proteins related to synthesis and degradation of proteins are most responsive and might play a central role in the heat stress response of pollen.

TI Proposal of the Autopsy Guideline for Infectious Diseases: Preparation
   for the Post-COVID-19 Era (abridged translation)
SO JOURNAL OF KOREAN MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB With the rapidly spreading coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic over the past few months, the world is facing an unprecedented crisis. Innumerable lives have been lost to this novel infectious disease, the nature of which supersedes conventional medical understanding. The COVID-19 pandemic is not just a global health crisis, several aspects of life in the post-COVID-19 era are also being contemplated. Experts in unison are warning that the upcoming changes in all areas of life could potentially be far more drastic than ever experienced in the entire human civilization. The medical community is no exception, and therefore, personnel involved in forensic medicine also need to be adequately prepared for the future. Forensic medicine is a branch of medicine dedicated to one of the most important stages of the human lifecycle and has always been at the forefront in times of unprecedented social change. The autopsy, one of the most important tools of forensic medicine, is also useful to infectious diseases because it identifies the causal relationship between death and infection, reveals medical and epidemiological knowledge, and provides objective evidence for legal disputes. We present new autopsy guidelines in forensic medicine, formulated based on the various infectious diseases that we presently live with and may encounter in the future. In formulation of these guidelines several considerations have been taken into account, namely, the role forensic pathologists should play in the post-COVID-19 era and the necessary preparations as well as the support needed from society to fulfill that role. The present COVID-19 outbreak should be a starting point for formulating improvements in current practices in forensic science, including autopsy biosafety practices and the medicolegal death investigation system.

TI Stefano De Franchi and the rustic Genoese dialect
SO ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ROMANISCHE PHILOLOGIE
AB The paper deals with the particular linguistic variety spoken by some servants in Stefano De Franchi's comedies (1714.1785). After briefly hinting at some fundamental aspects of his production (1), we examine the text of his comedies (2) and analyze the servants' language. This variety presents numerous traits which do not belong to Genoese (3), some others which will spread in the urban variety only between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (4) and many others which had been expelled from it between the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries (5). Finally (6), the linguistic analysis of Gerusalemme Liberata's Genoese translation (1755) will allow us to order chronologically the linguistic relics of 5.

TI UBUmaterial: building a performative archive on Instagram
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PERFORMANCE ARTS AND DIGITAL MEDIA
AB This document records and reflects on the process of building an innovative format, a performative archive on Instagram, the UBUmaterial, by Papalangki theatre company (Greece). It exhibits the occasion of its emergence, discusses the process of its development and presents the tools used and the materials produced as part of it. Furthermore, it gives information on its impact and considers its afterlife. UBUmaterial unfolds as a performative archive that occupies not a physical stage but a 'cyberstage' (Instagram) and is dedicated to the exhibition of Papalangki's attempt to rehearse Alfred Jarry's Ubu Roi at home, as a result of the restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, traditional rehearsal techniques and theatre approaches were not adopted, since it appeared necessary for all dramatic elements of the original play (language, character, plot) as well as the acting style to be adjusted to the new digital environment. Extensive use of digital tools and Instagram features enabled a rich output of video production. The album-like format of Instagram allowed for the creation of a virtual modelbook (in Brechtian terms), where videos from rehearsals were posted in a non-linear order. The archive will remain accessible forever and hopefully form a basis for new excursions.

TI How the evolution of multicellularity set the stage for cancer
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB Neoplastic growth and many of the hallmark properties of cancer are driven by the disruption of molecular networks established during the emergence of multicellularity. Regulatory pathways and molecules that evolved to impose regulatory constraints upon networks established in earlier unicellular organisms enabled greater communication and coordination between the diverse cell types required for multicellularity, but also created liabilities in the form of points of vulnerability in the network that when mutated or dysregulated facilitate the development of cancer. These factors are usually overlooked in genomic analyses of cancer, but understanding where vulnerabilities to cancer lie in the networks of multicellular species would provide important new insights into how core molecular processes and gene regulation change during tumourigenesis. We describe how the evolutionary origins of genes influence their roles in cancer, and how connections formed between unicellular and multicellular genes that act as key regulatory hubs for normal tissue homeostasis can also contribute to malignant transformation when disrupted. Tumours in general are characterised by increased dependence on unicellular processes for survival, and major dysregulation of the control structures imposed on these processes during the evolution of multicellularity. Mounting molecular evidence suggests altered interactions at the interface between unicellular and multicellular genes play key roles in the initiation and progression of cancer. Furthermore, unicellular network regions activated in cancer show high degrees of robustness and plasticity, conferring increased adaptability to tumour cells by supporting effective responses to environmental pressures such as drug exposure. Examining how the links between multicellular and unicellular regions get disrupted in tumours has great potential to identify novel drivers of cancer, and to guide improvements to cancer treatment by identifying more effective therapeutic strategies. Recent successes in targeting unicellular processes by novel compounds underscore the logic of such approaches. Further gains could come from identifying genes at the interface between unicellular and multicellular processes and manipulating the communication between network regions of different evolutionary ages.

TI Reading Hill's Versions of Ibsen's Brand and Peer Gynt as a
   Psychological Diptych
SO ETUDES ANGLAISES
AB Read together, Geoffrey Hill's superb translations of Henrik Ibsen's verse dramas Brand and Peer Gynt dramatize two opposing dangers for the human soul. In the case of Brand, the main character-a religious minister-is consumed by an overbearing righteousness that cruelly destroys love in the name of doctrinally warped, self-sacrificing "love." In the case of Peer Gynt, the main character-a failed poet who professes to loathe poetry-succumbs repeatedly to indulgent excess because of his selfishness, lust and greed. In psychoanalytic terms, both of these dangers can be understood as egotism, in which the ego over-identifies either with the superego's controlling functions or with the id's libidinous desires. In Hill's versions, the proto-Freudian implications of Ibsen's dramas suggest features of Hill's own psychological understandings. They adumbrate some of the challenges regarding religion and linguistic creativity that Hill wrestles with in his original poetry.

TI eIF3C as a prognostic marker of colorectal cancer
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PATHOLOGY
AB Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3C (eIF3C) is a component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complexes, which has a crucial role in the translation initiation process. As we know, translational control plays a key role in the complex mechanism of cancer development and progression. Besides, eIF3C downregulation decreases the global protein synthesis and causes a polysome run-off. In vitro and clinical trials were made to prove the relationship of eIF3C and colorectal cancer (CRC). We analyzed the eIF3C expression in a tissue microarray (TMA), which contained 198 colorectal cancer tissues and paired adjacent normal mucosa. The immunohistochemistry was used to assess the relative expression level of eIF3C and its value as a prognostic marker. SPSS was used to analysis the data to figure out the association between eIF3C and CRC. eIF3C was found highly expressed in CRC cells by in vitro experiments and clinical researches, and it can influence tumor proliferation, colony formation and cell cycle. In addition, eIF3C is an independent risk factor for CRC patients both OR and RFS. All in all, high eIF3C expression may contribute to tumor progression and predict poor clinical staging of colorectal cancer.

TI 'Subtle Instrument of Music': Translating the Sound and Appearance of
   Decadence in Wilde's &ITSalome&IT
SO CAHIERS VICTORIENS & EDOUARDIENS
AB Oscar Wilde's Salome was an adventure in decadence, decapitation, and the French language. Wilde called the play his 'first venture to use for art that subtle instrument of music, the French tongue' (Hart-Davis 331). Its initial performance in England was prohibited and it was not produced on stage until 1896; even then, it opened in Paris and not London. However, Wilde would not be thwarted; he insisted on publication, anyway. In fact, 'outraged at this philistine censorship of his art, Wilde defiantly published his play in February 1893, bound in 'Tyrian purple' wrappers to go with Alfred Douglas' gilt hair' (Hoare 73). This endeavor, however, presented another set of problems. English-speaking readers could only gain an accurate comprehension of the text with an equally accurate translation of the original French. After two exhaustive attempts at translation, each by men who knew (and loved) him well, Wilde conceded, it appears, that these were the best possible while working within the constraints of Victorian censorship. Wilde's personal objections to the translations were not the only issue. In Victorian England the French language, after all, was as unacceptably decadent as the play. In fact, the aesthetic passion in the French language lends itself to the extremism of the play; Salome would not be Salome without it. Through writing in French and, 'In choosing to write his version of Salome in the form of a play, Wilde rather archly extends the dynamics of the aestheticizing gaze and its struggle for perceptual authority out beyond the canvas of his art' (Greger 50). The play's overall concern here is not entirely the notion of passion, but decadence-that is, that fine line between the depraved and the indulgent. Examples of this exist and spring from the multilingual literary environment of Western Europe during the period. Wine, women, beauty, and sex were the bases for the hedonistic lifestyle led by those within the afore-mentioned places and eras, and these are communicated in both voice-or timbre-and meaning. Wilde would add another significant element to this definition through his portrayal of decadence in Salome: death. Sex and death become symbolic of the ultimate self-indulgent acts as Salome lusts after Iokanaan's severed head. These actions alone might be enough to shock and inspire the masses, but Wilde had more in mind. For him, the only language poetic enough to support such excess was French. As it happened, it was also the only culture open enough to receive it on stage, as well. French decadence-the sensuous vocality, the varying connotations taken on in the polyglot literary environment during the period, and the bold outward presentations of said language on stage- rides on both voice and meaning as it interacts with the play's subject matter, and results in the most depraved and indulgent of productions. The overall issue continued to be translation; the struggles in translating the play in terms of language were mirrored in translating the highly indulgent subject matter-made more so by the original language-for the English stage.

TI A neutralizing antibody against DKK1 does not reduce plaque formation in
   classical murine models of atherosclerosis: Is the therapeutic potential
   lost in translation?
SO ATHEROSCLEROSIS
AB Background and aims: Clinical interventions targeting nonlipid risk factors are needed given the high residual risk of atherothrombotic events despite effective control of dyslipidemia. Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) plays a lipid independent role in vascular pathophysiology but its involvement in atherosclerosis development and its therapeutic attractiveness remain to be established.
   Methods: Patient data, in vitro studies and pharmacological intervention in murine models of atherosclerosis were utilized.
   Results: In patients' material (n = 127 late stage plaque specimens and n = 10 control vessels), DKK1 mRNA was found to be higher in atherosclerotic plaques versus control arteries. DKK1 protein was detected in the luminal intimal area and in the necrotic core of plaques. DKK1 was released from isolated primary human platelets (similar to 12 21-fold) and endothelial cells (similar to 1.4-2.5-fold) upon stimulation with different pathophysiological stimuli. In ApoE(-/-) and Ldlr(-/-) mice, plasma DKK1 concentrations were similar to those observed in humans, whereas DKK1 expression in different atheroprone arterial segments was very low/absent. Chronic treatment with a neutralizing DKK1 antibody effectively reduced plasma concentrations, however, plaque lesion area was not reduced in ApoE(-/-) and Ldlr(-/-) mice fed a western diet for 14 and 16 weeks. Anti-DKK1 treatment increased bone volume and bone mineral content.
   Conclusions: Functional inhibition of DKK1 with an antibody does not alter atherosclerosis progression in classical murine models. This may reflect the absence of DKK1 expression in plaques and more advanced animal disease models could be needed to evaluate the role and therapeutic attractiveness of DKK1 in late stage complications such as plaque destabilization, calcification, rupture and thrombosis.

TI Irradiation of rainbow trout at early life stages results in a proteomic
   legacy in adult gills. Part A; proteomic responses in the irradiated
   fish and in non irradiated bystander fish
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB Exposure to a single 0.5 Gy X-ray dose of eggs at 48 h after fertilisation (48 h egg), eyed eggs, yolk sac larvae (YSL) and first feeders induces a legacy effect in adult rainbow trout. This includes the transmission of a bystander effect to non-irradiated adult trout which had swam with the irradiated fish. The aim of this study was to investigate this legacy by analysing the gill proteome of these irradiated and bystander fish. Irradiation at all of the early life stages resulted in changes to proteins which play a key role in development but are also known to be anti-tumorigenic and anti-oxidant: upregulation of haemoglobin subunit beta (48 h egg), haemoglobin, serum albumin 1 precursor (eyed eggs), clathrin heavy chain 1 isoform X10 (eyed eggs and first feeders), and actin related protein 2/3 complex subunit 4 (first feeders), downregulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase, histone 1 (48 h egg), triosephosphate isomerase (TPI), collagen alpha-1(1) chain like proteins (YSL), pyruvate kinase PKM-like protein (YSL and first feeders), ubiquitin-40S ribosomal proteins S27 and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 A isoform 1B (first feeders). However irradiation of YSL and first feeders (post hatching early life stages) also induced proteomic changes which have a complex relationship with tumorigenesis or cancer progression; downregulation of alpha-1-antiprotease-like protein precursor, vigilin isoform X2 and nucleoside diphosphate kinase (YSL) and upregulation of hyperosmotic glycine rich protein (first feeders). In bystander fish some proteomic changes were similar to those induced by irradiation: upregulation of haemoglobin subunit beta (48 h egg), haemoglobin (eyed eggs), actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 4, hyperosmotic glycine rich protein (first feeders), and downregulation of alpha-1-antiprotease-like protein, vigilin isoform X2, nucleoside diphosphate kinase (YSL), pyruvate kinase PKM-like protein and ubiquitin-40S ribosomal protein S27a-like (first feeders). Other proteomic changes were unique to bystander fish; downregulation of TPI, ubiquitin-40S ribosomal protein S2 (eyed egg), cofilin-2, cold-inducible RNA-binding protein B-like isoform X3 (YSL) and superoxide dismutase (first feeder), and upregulation of haemoglobin subunit alpha, collagen 1a1 precursor, apolipoprotein A-1-1 and A-1-2 precursor (first feeders). These bystander effect proteomic changes have been shown to be overwhelmingly anti-tumorigenic or protective of the fish gill.

TI Ultrasensitive Ribo-seq reveals translational landscapes during
   mammalian oocyte-to-embryo transition and pre-implantation development
SO NATURE CELL BIOLOGY
AB In mammals, translational control plays critical roles during oocyte-to-embryo transition (OET) when transcription ceases. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain challenging to study. Here, using low-input Ribo-seq (Ribo-lite), we investigated translational landscapes during OET using 30-150 mouse oocytes or embryos per stage. Ribo-lite can also accommodate single oocytes. Combining PAIso-seq to interrogate poly(A) tail lengths, we found a global switch of translatome that closely parallels changes of poly(A) tails upon meiotic resumption. Translation activation correlates with polyadenylation and is supported by polyadenylation signal proximal cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (papCPEs) in 3 ' untranslated regions. By contrast, translation repression parallels global de-adenylation. The latter includes transcripts containing no CPEs or non-papCPEs, which encode many transcription regulators that are preferentially re-activated before zygotic genome activation. CCR4-NOT, the major de-adenylation complex, and its key adaptor protein BTG4 regulate translation downregulation often independent of RNA decay. BTG4 is not essential for global de-adenylation but is required for selective gene de-adenylation and production of very short-tailed transcripts. In sum, our data reveal intimate interplays among translation, RNA stability and poly(A) tail length regulation underlying mammalian OET.
   Using an optimized Ribo-seq protocol that is applicable for low-input samples, Xie, Li and colleagues revealed the translation landscape during oocyte-to-embryo transition and in pre-implantation embryos.

TI TOWARDS A JUDAIC MILTON: TRANSLATING SAMSON AGONISTES INTO HEBREW
SO LITERATURE AND THEOLOGY
AB Joseph Massel's 1890 translation of Samson Agonistes into biblical Hebrew represents a problematic amalgam of Christian poetics and Judaic scripture. Published as a means of promoting Hebrew language renewal, Massel's rendition succeeds in transforming not only the linguistic constitution of the Miltonic drama, but also its religious and cultural meaning. The following essay examines the implications of translating Samson Agonistes into the language of the Tanakh, proposing that this Hebrew rendition functions to amend the historical, theological and political significance of its English source.

TI Bioinformatic Analysis Reveals the Distinct Role of 5'UTR-Specific m6A
   RNA Modification in Mice Developing Cerebral Cortices
SO DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROSCIENCE
AB N6-methyladenosine (m6A) abundantly exists in the cerebral cortex and is emerging as an essential factor in cortical development and function. As the m6A-binding site appears to be dynamically methylated in different RNA regions at the temporal-specific developing stage, it is of value to distinguish the unique character of region- and temporal-specific m6A. Herein, we analyzed the status of temporal-specific m6A within RNA 5 ' untranslated region (5 ' UTR) using m6A-methylated sequencing data and transcriptomic sequencing data from 12.5- to 13-day embryonic cerebral cortices and 14-day postnatal ones. We identified sorts of RNAs that are uniquely m6A-methylated in the 5'UTR and sorted them into specific neurological processes. Compared with 3'UTR-m6A-methylated RNAs, 5'UTR-m6A-methylated RNAs showed unique functions and mechanisms in regulating cortical development, especially through the pathway of mRNA transport and surveillance. Moreover, the 5'UTR-specific m6A was associated with neurological disorders as well. The FoxO signaling pathway was then focused by these pathogenic 5'UTR-m6A-methylated RNAs and explored to be involved in the determination of neurological disorders. Additionally, the 5'UTR-m6A modification patterns and transcriptional patterns play independent but cohesive roles in the developing cortices. Our study emphasizes the importance of 5'UTR-specific m6A in the developing cortex and provides an informative reference for future studies of 5'UTR-specific m6A in normal cortical development and neurological disorders.(c) 2021 S.

AB With the rise of television formats in global television, several studies have examined the economic, political, and cultural aspects of this media product's production and circulation. This study analyzes the complex path of a television drama series from a local critical and popular phenomenon to a global "quality" fiction format, focusing on the transnationalization process of the format of the Israeli program BeTipul from its arrival in the United States to its adaptation and reception in Canada, Argentina, Brazil, and Italy. The study emphasizes the cross-cultural dialogic attributes of the quality fiction format, which support a strategy comprising both mutual benefits and competition, as opposed to the allegedly "odorless" or "neutral" features of reality and game-show formats.

SO SCANDINAVICA
AB Translating from small literatures into a small language has specific mechanisms. This is even more true for countries of Central and Eastern Europe, which in the late 1980s underwent great changes. IN this case study, which follows up on the topic of former studies, the authors concentrate on the Finnish literature translated for the Czech book market after 1989. Finnish literature is understood only as published Finnish language fiction, poetry and drama. This study uses traditional chronological, statistical and comparativemethods, but is also inspired by Pierre Bourdieu's concept of literary field. A field of literary production, having two polarities (commercial/intellectual pole; young / old age), is enetered into by translators and publishers, who have their own strategies and capital (economical, cultural, social, educational, symbolical), and who select writers and books from a certain space of possibilities.

TI Potential roles of the poly(A)-binding proteins in translational
   regulation during spermatogenesis
SO JOURNAL OF REPRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Spermatogenesis is briefly defined as the production of mature spermatozoa from spermatogonial stem cells at the end of a strictly regulated process. It is well known that, to a large extent, transcriptional activity ceases at mid-spermiogenesis. Several mRNAs transcribed during early stages of spermatogenesis are stored as ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). During the later stages, translational control of these mRNAs is mainly carried out in a time dependent-manner by poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) in cooperation with other RNA-binding proteins and translation-related factors. Conserved PABPs specifically bind to poly(A) tails at the 3' ends of mRNAs to regulate their translational activity in spermatogenic cells. Studies in this field have revealed that PABPs, particularly poly(A)-binding protein cytoplasmic 1 (Pabpc1), Pabpc2, and the embryonic poly(A)-binding protein (Epab), play roles in the translational regulation of mRNAs required at later stages of spermatogenesis. In this review article, we evaluated the spatial and temporal expression patterns and potential functions of these PABPs in spermatogenic cells during spermatogenesis. The probable relationship between alterations in PABP expression and the development of male infertility is also reviewed.

TI Interdependency and Redundancy Add Complexity and Resilience to
   Biogenesis of Bacterial Ribosomes
SO ANNUAL REVIEW OF MICROBIOLOGY
AB The pace and efficiency of ribosomal subunit production directly impact the fitness of bacteria. Biogenesis demands more than just the union of ribosomal components, including RNA and proteins, to form this functional ribonucleoprotein particle. Extra-ribosomal protein factors play a fundamental role in the efficiency and efficacy of ribosomal subunit biogenesis. A paucity of data on intermediate steps, multiple and overlapping pathways, and the puzzling number of functions that extra-ribosomal proteins appear to play in vivo make unraveling the formation of this macromolecular assemblage difficult. In this review, we outline with examples the multinodal landscape of factor-assisted mechanisms that influence ribosome synthesis in bacteria. We discuss in detail late-stage events that mediate correct ribosome formation and the transition to translation initiation and thereby ensure high-fidelity protein synthesis.

Evaluation can play a key role in enhancing successful application of research-based programs and tools as well as informing program refinement and future research. Discussion centers on what is unique about evaluating programs and policies for implementation impact (or potential for dissemination). Central issues reviewed include the importance of context and local issues, robustness and external validity issues, multiple levels of evaluation, implementation fidelity versus customization, choosing evaluation designs to fit questions, and who participates and characteristics of success at each stage of program recruitment, delivery, and outcome. The use of mixed quantitative and qualitative methods is especially important, and the primary redirection that is needed is to focus on questions of decision makers and potential adoptees rather than the research colleagues.

TI Regulation of viral gene expression by duck enteritis virus UL54
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Duck enteritis virus (DEV) UL54 is a homologue of human herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) ICP27, which plays essential regulatory roles during infection. Our previous studies indicated that DEV UL54 is an immediate-early protein that can shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In the present study, we found that UL54-deleted DEV (DEV-Delta UL54) exhibits growth kinetics, a plaque size and a viral DNA copy number that are significantly different from those of its parent wild-type virus (DEV-LoxP) and the revertant (DEV-Delta UL54 (Revertant)). Relative viral mRNA levels, reflecting gene expression, the transcription phase and the translation stage, are also significantly different between DEV-Delta UL54-infected cells and DEV-LoxP/DEV-Delta UL54-(Revertant)-infected cells. However, the localization pattern of UL30 mRNA is obviously changed in DEV-Delta UL54-infected cells. These findings suggest that DEV UL54 is important for virus growth and may regulate viral gene expression during transcription, mRNA export and translation.

TI Distinct features of the Leishmania cap-binding protein LeishIF4E2
   revealed by CRISPR-Cas9 mediated hemizygous deletion
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB Leishmania parasites cycle between sand-fly vectors and mammalian hosts adapting to alternating environments by stage-differentiation accompanied by changes in the proteome profiles. Translation regulation plays a central role in driving the differential program of gene expression since control of gene regulation in Leishmania is mostly post-transcriptional. The Leishmania genome encodes six eIF4E candidates, some of which bind a dedicated eIF4G candidate, and each eIF4E is assumed to have specific functions with perhaps some overlap. However, LeishIF4E2 does not bind any known eIF4G ortholog and was previously shown to comigrate with the polysomal fractions of sucrose gradients in contrast to the other initiation factors that usually comigrate with pre-initiation and initiation complexes. Here we deleted one of the two LeishIF4E2 gene copies using the CRISPR-Cas9 methodology. The deletion caused severe alterations in the morphology of the mutant cells that became round, small, and equipped with a very short flagellum that did not protrude from its pocket. Reduced expression of LeishIF4E2 had no global effect on translation and growth, unlike other LeishIF4Es; however, there was a change in the proteome profile of the LeishIF4E2(+/-) cells. Upregulated proteins were related mainly to general metabolic processes including enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism, DNA repair and replication, signaling, and cellular motor activity. The downregulated proteins included flagellar rod and cytoskeletal proteins, as well as surface antigens involved in virulence. Moreover, the LeishIF4E2(+/-) cells were impaired in their ability to infect cultured macrophages. Overall, LeishIF4E2 does not behave like a general translation factor and its function remains elusive. Our results also suggest that the individual LeishIF4Es perform unique functions.
   Author summary
   Leishmania parasites cause a broad spectrum of diseases with different pathological symptoms. During their life cycle the parasites shuffle between sand-fly vectors and mammalian hosts adapting to the changing environments via a stage specific program of gene expression that promotes their survival. Translation initiation plays a key role in control of gene expression and in Leishmania this is exemplified by the presence of multiple cap-binding complexes that interact with mRNAs. The parasites encode multiple paralogs of the cap-binding translation initiation factor eIF4E and of its corresponding binding partner eIF4G forming complexes with different potential functions. The role of LeishIF4E2 remains elusive: it does not bind any of the LeishIF4G candidate subunits and associates with polysomes, a feature less common for canonical translation factors. Here we generated a hemizygous Leishmania mutant of the least studied cap-binding paralog, LeishIF4E2, by eliminating one of the two alleles using the CRISPR-Cas9 methodology. The mutant showed morphological defects with short and rounded cells, and a significant reduction in their flagellar length. Moreover, the LeishIF4E2(+/-) cells were impaired in their ability to infect cultured macrophages. The mutants showed differences in their proteome: upregulated proteins were related mainly to general metabolic processes including enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism, DNA repair and replication, signaling, and cellular motor activity. Downregulated proteins included flagellar rod and cytoskeletal proteins, as well as surface antigens involved in virulence. Overall, LeishIF4E2 does not behave like a general translation factor and its function remains elusive. It could affect translation of a particular set of transcripts, causing direct or downstream effects that do not affect global translation. Our results suggest that individual LeishIF4Es perform specific functions.

TI Constructing leadership through translating im/politeness
SO TRANSLATION AND TRANSLANGUAGING IN MULTILINGUAL CONTEXTS
AB The use of im/politeness in political discourse has attracted relatively little attention in im/politeness scholarship (Tracy 2017). The study examines how the character of a leader may be intra-/cross-culturally reshaped, in translated drama, through the use of im/politeness strategies. To this end, the study examines the use of im/politeness strategies in two Greek versions (Belies 1997; Karthaios 2004) of William Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar. Etic and emic approaches to the data show differences in the way the character of Brutus is portrayed, by the translators' manipulating im/politeness strategies in his discourse. The study uses the 'horizontal' dimension of intimacy/distance and the 'vertical' dimension of power (Spencer-Oatey 1996) to show that the first translation (Karthaios 2004) shows Brutus to be making use of a less impressive persuasive strategy when addressing the public, the second translation (Belies 1997) seems to show Brutus' potential to express intimacy towards the public, which made the persuasive force of his discourse more convincing. The study shows that im/politeness is a significant tool in the hands of translators who shape the identity of the leader and that translated versions of a playtext can fruitfully show preferred patterns of behaviour which may be pointing to cultural patterns of interaction.

Ode to a lover of the imitation arts) because they take into account the sapphic person and work, combined in the classic category of fame. An 18th-century woman writer projects the voice and figure of the ancient poetess into enlightened Modernity, with a new political and proto-feminist perspective. This projection shows that classical tradition operates as a multidirectional phenomenon, since it is channeled through a complex network of intermediate readings that involves different genres and traditions (Greek lyric poetry, Roman epistolary genre, French travel narrative, Spanish dramatic writing) and various translation strategies (translation from French and Greek as agents of reception).

SO ARTIFARA-REVISTA DE LENGUAS Y LITERATURAS IBERICAS Y LATINOAMERICANAS
AB In this article we analyze the two Spanish versions of the play The Savior (Morton, 1992), an earlier one adapted by Morton himself and Honduran Teatro La Fragua (Romero de las Americas, 2010) and a later one by I. C. Flores Hernandez and Teatro Universitario de la Benemerita Universidad Autonoma de Puebla (Romero, el Salvador, unpublished). The play, set in El Salvador in the Seventies, features the last years of life and the killing of archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero. Drawing on the theoretical framework of the School of Manipulation and Lefevere's construct of rewriting (Lefevere, 1982; 1992) we argue that the different approaches adopted for the two translations (the former relatively more target-oriented and the latter relatively more source-oriented) are largely motivated by the extra-textual constraints in which they were produced, namely the socio-historical setting and purpose of the translation (i.e., stage performance).

TI Minimal Sartre: Diagonalization and Pure Reflection
SO OPEN PHILOSOPHY
AB These remarks take up the reflexive problematics of Being and Nothingness and related texts from a metalogical perspective. A mutually illuminating translation is posited between, on the one hand, Sartre's theory of pure reflection, the linchpin of the works of Sartre's early period and the site of their greatest difficulties, and, on the other hand, the quasi-formalism of diagonalization, the engine of the classical theorems of Cantor, Godel, Tarski, Turing, etc. Surprisingly, the dialectic of mathematical logic from its inception through the discovery of the diagonal theorems can be recognized as a particularly clear instance of the drama of reflection according to Sartre, especially in the positing and overcoming of its proper value-ideal, viz. the synthesis of consistency and completeness. Conversely, this translation solves a number of systematic problems about pure reflection's relations to accessory reflection, phenomenological reflection, pre-reflective self-consciousness, conversion, and value. Negative foundations, the metaphysical position emerging from this translation between existential philosophy and metalogic, concurs by different paths with Badiou's Being and Event in rejecting both ontotheological foundationalisms and constructivist anti-foundationalisms.

TI A Bibliography of Avaghosa
SO JOURNAL OF INDIAN PHILOSOPHY
AB Though quite extensive in its coverage, the present bibliography does not claim to be exhaustive. Among the many works traditionally (but incorrectly) ascribed to Avaghosa, some, such as the *Mahynaraddhotpdastra (Taish no. 1666, 1667) or, to a lesser degree, the Kalpanmaitik alias trlakra, have lived their own lives in modern scholarship and received virtually as much attention as Avaghosa himself. An attempt has been made to list all the contributions that have proved decisive in questioning and finally rejecting the poet's authorship of them. In much the same way, most of what has been written about the Chinese and Japanese elaborations of the figure of Avaghosa (as a patriarch, as a god of sericulture, etc.) has been disregarded. Collecting in a systematic way all Indian editions and translations in modern-day Indian languages (Bengali, Hindi, etc.) has proved practically impossible.

TI In silico integrative analysis of multi-omics reveals regulatory layers
   for diurnal gene expression in mouse liver
SO FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Diurnal oscillation persists throughout the body and plays an essential role in maintaining physiological homeostasis. Disruption of diurnal rhythm contributes to many diseases including type 2 diabetes. The regulatory mechanism of the transcription-translation feedback loop (TTFL) of core clock genes is well-established, while a systematic study across all regulatory layers of gene expression, including gene transcription, RNA translation, and DNA binding protein (DBP) activities, is still lacking. We comprehensively bioinformatics analyzed the rhythmicity of gene transcription, mature RNA abundance, protein abundance and DBP activity using publicly available omic-datasets from mouse livers. We found that the core clock genes, Bmal1 and Rev-erb alpha, persistently retained rhythmicity in all stages, which supported the essential rhythmic function along with the TTFL. Interestingly, there were many layer-specific rhythmic genes playing layer-specific rhythmic functions. The systematic analysis of gene transcription rate, RNA translation efficiency, and post-translation modification of DBP were incorporated to determine the potential mechanisms for layer-specific rhythmic genes. We observed the gene with rhythmic expression in both mature RNA and protein layers were largely due to relatively consistent translation rate. In addition, rhythmic translation rate induced the rhythms of protein whose mature RNA levels were not rhythmic. Further analysis revealed a phosphorylation-mediated and an enhancer RNA-mediated cycling regulation between the corresponding layers. This study presents a global view of the oscillating genes in multiple layers via a systematical analysis and indicates the complexity of regulatory mechanisms across different layers for further functional study.

TI The role of the meniscotibial ligament in posteromedial rotational knee
   stability
SO KNEE SURGERY SPORTS TRAUMATOLOGY ARTHROSCOPY
AB Tears of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus (PHMM) are very common in the ACL-deficient knee. Specific lesions of the PHMM have been described in the setting of ACL rupture: ramp lesions and injuries to the meniscotibial ligament. There are little data available regarding the role these lesions play in knee instability. The aim of this study is to analyse the biomechanical consequences of ramp and meniscotibial ligament lesions on knee stability. Our hypothesis was that these lesions would cause increased instability in the setting of ACL rupture.
   A cadaveric study was undertaken: ten knees were included for analysis. The biomechanical repercussions of different meniscoligamentous injuries were studied in four stages: stage 1 involved testing the intact knee, stage 2 after transection of the ACL, stage 3 following creation of a ramp lesion, and stage 4 after detachment of the meniscotibial ligament. Four parameters were measured during the experiment: anterior tibial translation under a force of 134 N, internal and external tibial rotation under a torque of 5 Nm, and valgus angulation under a torque of 10 Nm. Measurements were taken in four knee flexion positions: 0A degrees or full extension, 30A degrees, 70A degrees, and 90A degrees of flexion.
   There was a statistically significant increase in anterior tibial translation for stage 2 (6.8 +/- A 1.3 mm, p a parts per thousand currency sign 0.001), stage 3 (9.4 +/- A 1.3 mm, p a parts per thousand currency sign 0.001), and stage 4 (9.3 +/- A 1.3 mm, p a parts per thousand currency sign 0.001) compared to stage 1. There was no significant difference between stage 2 and stage 3 (2.6 mm, n.s.) or stage 4 (2.5 mm, n.s.). We did, however, demonstrate an increase in anterior tibial translation of 2.6 mm after the creation on a lesion of the PHMM compared to isolated division of the ACL, for all flexion angles combined. There was an increase in internal tibial rotation between stage 1 and stage 4 (3.2A degrees A A +/- A 0.7A degrees, p a parts per thousand currency sign 0.001) and between stage 2 and stage 4 (2.0A degrees A A +/- A 0.7A degrees, p = 0.023). A significant difference was demonstrated for external rotation under 5 Nm torque between stages 4 and 1 (2.2A degrees A A +/- A 0.5A degrees, p a parts per thousand currency sign 0.001) and between stages 4 and 2 (1.7A degrees A A +/- A 0.5A degrees, p = 0.007) for all knee flexion angles combined. No created lesion had a significant effect on medial laxity under a 10-Nm valgus torque at any degree of knee flexion.
   Lesions of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus are frequent in cases of anterior cruciate ligament rupture. These lesions appear to play a significant role in knee stability. Ramp lesions increase the forces in the ACL, and the PHMM is a secondary restraint to anterior tibial translation. Lesions of the meniscotibial ligament may increase rotatory instability of the knee.

TI The authority of geography in Pericles, Prince of Tyre: Jacob
   Falckenburgk and Dionysius Periegetes
SO SEDERI-YEARBOOK OF THE SPANISH AND PORTUGUESE SOCIETY FOR ENGLISH
   RENAISSANCE STUDIES
AB Taking into account the complex authorship of Pericles, Prince of Tyre, this paper surveys the intertextual influence of the Latin verse narrative of the Apollonius saga by Jacob Falckenburgk (London, 1578) and Thomas Twayne's translation of Orbis terrae descriptio (The Surveye of the world) by Dionysius Periegetes (London, 1572) on the erratic geography of Pericles. Drawing on the Pericles/Apollonius tales (the play and its Latin verse and English prose intertexts), as well as the ancient geographic narrative describing the Eastern Mediterranean spaces of the settings, the play decentres the authority of ancient geography maintained via the well-travelled Apollonius tale or through the weight of classical texts. Pericles destabilizes the authority of both classical language and geography through a process of defamiliarization of and distancing from the legitimization of ancient texts and geographic tradition. Through the suggestion of alterity during the dramatic interaction, the play incorporates the recognition of difference and the support of tolerance within early modern transnational communities.

TI Special Issue: Clair-obscur Introduction
SO JOURNAL FOR EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES
AB Clair-obscur offers a rich case-study for the use of metaphor in eighteenth-century France. Far from being a neutral translation from the Italian chiaroscuro, the appearance of the term is intimately linked to the Querelle do colons, whose stakes are specifically French. Its propagation at the turn of the eighteenth century may explain why it was exported away from the fine arts towards figurative meanings, often bearing its originally polemical dimension and illustrating a shift in aesthetic perception and reception. This volume aims to provide some evidence for this hypothesis in fields such as drama, music and dance, philosophy and fiction.

TI Shipwreck in Realm of the Dead. Competing Antiquity-References in
   Gerhart Hauptmann's One-Acter Play Agamemnon's Death
SO PHILOLOGUS
AB In Hauptmann's reception of antiquity there is an overlap between the 'dark' (i.e. chthonic, Dionysiac, barbaric) understanding of the Greeks, which had been introduced by Bachofen and Nietzsche and which was characteristic of modernism as a whole around 1900, and a late neoclassical view of the Hellenic legacy, which is manifested not least in his drawing on the literary translations of the nineteenth century (in the case of the three tragedians, Donner's translations "in the original metres"). The same tension is a feature also of his late Atrides Tetralogy. Its second part, Agamemnons Tod ('Agamemnon's Death') not only recurs to Aeschylus' Oresteia, to which Hauptmann had responded with enthusiasm in his youth, but is also influenced by the chthonic Homer interpretation of his first drama on a theme from the ancient world, Der Bogen des Odysseus ('Odysseus' Bow'), and by nineteenth-century archaeology at Mycenae.

TI A hymn for dark times (Wer nur den lieben Gott lasst walten - If thou
   but suffer God to guide thee)
SO TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE
AB Covid-19 has caused suffering on many levels and there is no doubt that the consequences will be felt for years to come. During the pandemic, people were also reminded that, throughout history, people have been subjected to immense suffering. The First World War (1914-1918) ended just over a hundred years ago. In this devastating war that "had to prevent all further wars", 22 million people died. In the year it ended, the Spanish Flu broke out and another 50 million people died. Perspectives on past events that adversely affected the lives of people might help people to interpret their own situation and see the present in a different perspective. One could ask: what sustains people in difficult times? What gives them courage? What gives them resilience and helps them through lockdowns? In this article, it is argued that faith, lived religion and rituals can give people new perspectives and that hymns, that is, songs of faith, play a significant role. A hymn of German origin, Wer nur den lieben Gott lasst walten, is presented as an example. The background to the origin of the text is given, whereafter the original German text and the Afrikaans translation, as well as the revised versions of the translation, are discussed critically. A futher discussion of the reception history of the hymn follows, showing its use during war and in two films, and how it could function as an illustration of lived religion.
   The writer of the hymn text, Georg Neumark (1621-1681), was born during a devastating war in Germany that lasted thirty years. In his early twenties, he travelled to Konigsberg to study law, but was robbed of all his earthly possessions by highway robbers mugging the mail coach. He interpreted his difficult existential circumstances from the perspective of lived religion and wrote a hymn of comfort, a "Trostlied", Wer nur den lieben Gott lasst walten, encouraging himself and others by saying that one should let God be in control of one's life and that one could trust God. The text contains striking alliteration and assonance that lend a poetic quality to it. It is accompanied by a touching melody that Neumark composed for the text - the only melody written by Neumark that is known. The text with seven stanzas was first published in Neumark's song collection Fortgepflanzter Musikalisch-Poetischer Lustwald (Jena, 1657) and has been translated into several languages. The English translation entitled If thou but suffer God to guide thee was done by Catherine Winkworth (1855, 1863). In 1931, GBA Gerdener translated it into Afrikaans. Six of the seven stanzas were retained in the first offficial hymnal in Afrikaans, Psalm- en Gesangboek ( 1944). The text was amended and drastically shortened to three stanzas for the second official hymnal, the Psalm- en Gesangboek (1978). More radical changes were made for the version published in the third and current official hymnal, Liedboek van die Kerk (2001). The original Afrikaans translation relied heavily on a Dutch translation by Abraham Rutgers (Liedboek voor de Kerken 1994:429). It reflected certain problems in the Dutch translation, but stayed true to the original German text. When the Afrikaans text was revised at various stages, however, the original German text and the texts on which the original was based, were not considered sufficiently. Significant features of the original text thus got lost, especially in the latest version in Afrikaans. It is argued, however, that certain aspects of the current text, coupled with aspects of the old text in Afrikaans that are still alive in the hymnic memory of people, and carried by the very fitting melody, could still sustain people in difficult times.
   The reception history of the hymn in contexts where the original text plays a strong role and also where translations close to the original are used, shows its use on various levels as part of the lived faith or lived religion of people. Besides being a source of comfort to civilian Germans during World War 1, the German version was also used for militaristic and patriotic purposes during the war. It plays a prominent role in two films - Babette's Feast (1987), a Danish film, and Vaya con Dios (2002), a German film. The films illustrate that God's voice can be heard in songs of faith and that this hymn can open up broader perspectives, and give people a voice in difficult circumstances. In the films, the hymn expresses gratitude, love, community and trust. The hymn can remind people that God is present in dark days and in suffering and can give hope. It can remind people of God's love and indicate the path they need to follow. The performative power unleashed when singing the hymn, can transform people. It is argued that when the hymn is sung, space can open up and people be freed from their confinement, their lockdown and their shelters. They can sing, pray and follow God's way - and in doing so, also comfort and support others.

Over the past 25 years, studies on yeast and human models have made it possible to identify RPL10 (ribosomal protein L10 gene), which is a constituent of the large subunit of the ribosome, as an important player in the final stages of ribosome biogenesis and in ribosome function. Here, we reviewed the literature to give an overview of the role of RPL10 in physiologic and pathologic processes, including inherited disease and cancer.

TI Novel upregulation of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) by
   microRNA-346 via targeting of APP mRNA 5 '-untranslated region:
   Implications in Alzheimer's disease
SO MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY
AB In addition to the devastating symptoms of dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by accumulation of the processing products of the amyloid-beta (A beta) peptide precursor protein (APP). APP's non-pathogenic functions include regulating intracellular iron (Fe) homeostasis. MicroRNAs are small (similar to 20 nucleotides) RNA species that instill specificity to the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). In most cases, RISC inhibits mRNA translation through the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) sequence. By contrast, we report a novel activity of miR-346: specifically, that it targets the APP mRNA 5'UTR to upregulate APP translation and A beta production. This upregulation is reduced but not eliminated by knockdown of argonaute 2. The target site for miR-346 overlaps with active sites for an iron-responsive element (IRE) and an interleukin-1 (IL-1) acute box element. IREs interact with iron response protein1 (IRP1), an iron-dependent translational repressor. In primary human brain cultures, miR-346 activity required chelation of Fe. In addition, miR-346 levels are altered in lateBraak stage AD. Thus, miR-346 plays a role in upregulation of APP in the CNS and participates in maintaining APP regulation of Fe, which is disrupted in late stages of AD. Further work will be necessary to integrate other metals, and IL-1 into the Fe-miR-346 activity network. We, thus, propose a "FeAR" (Fe, APP, RNA) nexus in the APP 5'-UTR that includes an overlapping miR-346-binding site and the APP IRE. When a "healthy FeAR" exists, activities of miR-346 and IRP/Fe interact to maintain APP homeostasis. Disruption of an element that targets the FeAR nexus would lead to pathogenic disruption of APP translation and protein production.

TI Circular RNAs: Functions and Clinical Significance in Cardiovascular
   Disease
SO FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB Cardiovascular disease (CVD) causes high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Accumulating research has indicated the possible roles played by circular RNAs (circRNAs) in the pathogenesis of CVD. CircRNAs are non-coding RNAs with covalently closed loop structures. CircRNAs can function by acting as miRNA sponges, RNA binding protein sponges, mRNA transcriptional regulators and templates for protein translation. The specific characteristics of circRNAs such as high stability, abundant distribution, and tissue- and developmental stage-specific expression make them potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of CVD. In this paper, we systematically summarized the current knowledge regarding the biogenesis, biological properties and the action mechanisms of circRNAs, elucidated the roles played by circRNAs in the pathogenesis of CVD, and explored the diagnostic potential of circRNAs in CVD. With in-depth studies, an increasing number of molecular mechanisms underlying the participation of circRNAs in CVD may be elucidated, and the application of circRNAs in the clinical diagnosis and prevention of CVD may eventually be realized.

TI AT HOME WITH THE STRANGE: SEVEN INTERPRETATIONS OF ODON VON HORVATH'S
   DRAMATIC OEUVRE
SO KNJIZEVNA SMOTRA
AB Post-1918 Austrian literature is marked by radical changes caused by the end of the First World War and the dissolution of the Habsburg Monarchy. For many Austrian authors the life thus broke into two halves, the period before the First World War and the time after. The authors such as Joseph Roth or Odon von Horvath remain landless in a double sense, temporally but - as the authors who work in a culturally foreign territory of the Weimar Republic - also spatially. It is in this context that the dramatic oeuvre of the "old Austrian" author Odon von Horvath acquires a special role. His heterogeneous origin and polyphony derived from it turn him into an exceedingly exceptional observer of the world of crisis in Germany and Austria after 1918. Wolfgang Muller Funk's work does not pretend to offer a final interpretation of the author's plays in the 1920s and the 1930s but is understood as a proposal for reading. The themes and motifs such as empathy, alienation in the world, ambivalence, inflation and the loss of footing, a new constellation of the sexes, cold objectivity and preference for the median, half-public spaces present high points that mark the atmosphere and the structure of Horvath's works. In a manner of speaking, this oeuvre, based on psychoanalysis among others, can be understood as a critical model opposed to Brecht's programmatic anti-psychological epic theater. Horvath's "folk pieces" aim at revealing the dark and subconscious aspects of the human.

The second part of the article delivers an analytical discussion of examples of authorial titling in mainstream British drama to demonstrate the penetration of transformative subtitling in commercial media products that also posit spectatorial subjectivity. The article concludes by reflecting on the parataxic reading practices that these new subtitling practices encourage and the fluid nature of the transnational collectivities it caters for.

Using Brechean epic theatre, elements of madang-geuk (outdoor, episodic performances colored by traditional Korean theatre aesthetics), and local literature or history as its source, the company transitioned from a student workshop with no space of its own to a group with a permanent little theatre style space in first the Shinchon area and then the Daehakro theatre district. Its exemplary productions both reflected and spurred the movement toward democratization and freedom of speech in the fraught political environment of a country repressed by the military-led government of President Chun Doo-Hwan.
   Jungman Park is an assistant professor in School of English for Interpretation and Translation at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. His research interests are theatre history (both Western and Korean) and modern British and American drama. His publications have appeared in Journal of Modern British and American Drama, Hanguk Yeongeukhak (Korean Theatre Studies), Journal of American Studies, Journal of English Language and Language, Asian Theatre Journal, and Shakespeare Reviews.

TI Role of succinic acid in the regulation of sepsis
SO INTERNATIONAL IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB Sepsis is a life-threatening disease characterized by a defensive response to damage. The immune response in patients with sepsis is overenhanced in the early stages and suppressed in the later stages, leading to poor prognosis. Metabolic reprogramming and epigenetic changes play a role in sepsis. Metabolic intermediates such as elevated succinic acid levels are significantly altered in patients with sepsis. Succinic acid, a metabolic in-termediate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, participates in energy supply and plays a role in metabolic reprog-ramming. Simultaneously, as an epigenetic regulator, it participates in gene transcription, translation, and post -translational modifications. It also participates in the inflammatory response, hypoxia, and the production of reactive oxygen species via endocrine and paracrine pathways. In this review, we have discussed the effects of succinic acid on sepsis and its therapeutic potential.

TI From Casket to Court via Mercy and the Ring: Commemorating Shakespeare's
   Portia in The Merchant of Venice
SO MULTICULTURAL SHAKESPEARE-TRANSLATION APPROPRIATION AND PERFORMANCE
AB Shakespeare's comedies mark his artistic excellence in the portrayal of woman characters. Shakespearean women have invariably moved the audience and their understanding towards them from being sweet and mawkish to expressing their needs sternly for integrity, justice through wit and intelligence in his plays. Often strongly approved by the modern feminists, the qualities of intelligence and assertiveness are regarded as admirable qualities in Shakespearean comic heroines. As revolutionaries, Shakespearean female characters have always been projected as strong, sometimes stronger than the male counterparts; often going against the conventions of the society to symbolize what gender equality in the future may be like. Essential qualities like intelligence and wit always fulfilled and made Shakespearean heroines independent personalities. The female characters in Shakespeare's plays always played an important role in the dramatic run in both tragedies and comedies. This article studies the portrayal of intelligence by Portia in The Merchant of Venice making her the hero of the play.

TI Building Resilience Against ViolencE (BRAVE): protocol of a parenting
   intervention for mothers and fathers with post-traumatic stress disorder
   in Pakistan
SO GLOBAL MENTAL HEALTH
AB Background. Prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is high in Pakistan both due to natural disasters and ongoing conflicts. Offspring of trauma survivors are at increased risk for mental and physical illnesses. Parental PTSD has been linked to troubled parent-child relationships, behaviour problems, trauma symptoms, and depression in children. This study aims to explore the acceptability, feasibility and indications of the effectiveness of group learning through play plus trauma-focused cognitive behaviour therapy (LTP Plus TF-CBT) for parents experiencing PTSD.
   Methods/Design. This is a two-arm pilot cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT). We aim to recruit 300 parents with a diagnosis of PTSD. The screening will be done using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised. Diagnosis of PTSD will be confirmed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale-5 (CAPS-5). Union Councils from Peshawar and Karachi will be randomised into either group LTP Plus TF CBT arm or treatment as usual (TAU). The intervention includes 12 sessions of LTP Plus TF-CBT delivered weekly in the first 2 months and then fortnightly in a group setting by trained psychologists. The groups will be co-facilitated by the community health workers (CHWs). Parents will be assessed at baseline and 4th month (end of the intervention), using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) Scale, Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI), and Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ-3)
   Discussion. This trial would help build an understanding of the acceptability, feasibility and indications of the effectiveness of a low-cost parenting intervention.

TI Strange Oeillades No More: The Three Daughters of Lear from the Tokyo
   Shakespeare Company's "Shakespeare through the Looking-glass"
SO SHAKESPEARE
AB Discussions about Shakespeare productions in Japan have focused predominantly on adaptations, appropriations, translations, and experiments in creating an indigenous or intercultural Shakespeare. Such studies tend to underscore the Japanese qualities of the productions. What they have neglected, for the most part, has been an equally important group of productions: appropriations and adaptations whose main aim is not to create a Japanese Shakespeare. These productions do not obsess over the cultural divide but invite the audience to explore their identities by engaging more directly with the plays. The Tokyo Shakespeare Company (established in 1990), a theater troupe which has hitherto escaped academic attention, has produced five such appropriations in a series called Shakespeare through the Looking-glass. The Three Daughters of Lear (1995), the first in this series, depicts the post-mortem struggles of Lear's daughters to understand what has happened to them. It deals with such issues as the absent mother and the daughter's duty. Plays such as this suggest the potential of Japanese productions of Shakespeare evolving into the intercultural Shakespeare that critics such as Rustom Bharucha propose; they are testimony to how Shakespeare, having become very much a part of Japanese culture, can mirror the audience's reality by way of the issues explored in the play, without references to the indigenous culture.

TI DELAT OPRAVDOVE DIVADLO I [TO MAKE REAL THEATRE 11. AN ANNOTATED
   CRITICAL EDITION OF LIBRETTOS FOR BOHUSLAV MARTINLI'S COMPLETE OUTPUT
   FOR STAGE FROM THE YEARS 1913-1937, AND A CRITICAL SCORE EDITION OF HIS
   OPERAS MARIKEN DE NIMEGUE AND ALEXANDRE BIS
SO HUDEBNI VEDA
AB Theatre music represents one of the largest parts of Bohuslav Martinh's compositional output. Taking into account even works that are currently unaccounted for, Martinu wrote a total of 35 compositions for stage, including T1 in the period before the Second World War. Some of them have remained unpublished to this day, and production of others have so far relied on old editions.
   The Martinu Institute has managed to discover a multitude of new source materials: librettos, synopses, autograph scores, and piano reductions and their reproductions. By no means exceptional in this process have been either discoveries or scholarly reconstructions of previously completely unknown works. All of this has made it possible to study the genesis of each work, its reception, and the fate of its autograph scores, as well as of their copies and printed editions.
   The present study prepares the ground for a monograph representing a critical edition, making accessible to English readers an annotated critical edition of the composer's librettos and his reflections on theatre music, and deals with general philological issues, and with editorial principles underlying the critical edition of Martinu's librettos and other texts, as well as his correspondence.
   The project will also include the publication of critical score editions of the operas Mariken de Nimegue, and Alexandre bis. Mariken de Nimegue, H 236/2 I (1933), based on the libretto in French by Henry Gheon, was composed in July 1933. It is the first version of a one-acter from the opera cycle Les Jeux de Marie, H 236 (1934), and it was composed less than one year later, setting the Czech translation of the original text. The present study charts the opera's genesis, drawing on new findings and the discovery of new source materials (Martinh's correspondence with Gheon, autograph libretto, etc.), and pointing to further new information acquired in the course of source exploration and editorial work.
   The opera Alexandre bis, H 255 (1937), setting the libretto from Andre Wurmser, was written by Martinu for the 1937 World Exposition in Paris, but he apparently failed to meet the deadline for its completion. The premiere had to wait until 18 February, 1964, when it took place at the Opernhaus Mannheim. The anticipated edition is based on four autograph music sources: a sketch, a fragment of the opera's original beginning, a score, and a piano reduction.

TI Translating the 'Other' for the Western World for more than a decade:
   Incredible India! campaigns
SO ALTRE MODERNITA-RIVISTA DI STUDI LETTERARI E CULTURALI
AB When we analyse and translate tourist texts promoting or dealing with non-Western destinations we certainly have to take into account the weight of postcolonial discourses in the representation of these places in the tourist field. Many ex-colonies have become popular tourist destinations, while the detritus of post-colonialism have been transformed into tourist sights, including exotic peoples and customs; artefacts; indigenous lifestyles and cultural heritage (Craik). Therefore, if tourism reinforces postcolonial relationships, tourist texts are deeply embedded in colonial discourses. Some scholars have argued that tourism is a form of "leisure imperialism" and represents "the hedonistic face of neocolonialism" (Crick 322). Hall and Tucker have dedicated a volume to the relation between postcolonial thought and tourism referring back to Edward Said's seminal work on Orientalism (1978) and to Ashcroft, Griffiths and Tiffin's The Empire Writes Back (1989), both works which outline the ontological and epistemological distinction that has been made between the Western world and the 'Other'. Encounters with the non-Western have always provided fuel for myths and mythical language and tourism has developed its own promotional lexicon and repertoire of myths (Selwyn), and as a matter of fact, otherness can be an element that makes a destination worth a visit. Studies have demonstrated how the representation of the 'Other' is closely linked to the popularization of accounts of travels and explorations in imperial lands (Pratt; Spurr), and sadly this representation is still part of tourist place promotion (Hall and Page). It is a fact that tourism plays a central role in transforming collective and individual values through ideas of commoditization (Cohen), which implies that what were once cultural displays of living traditions or cultural texts of lived authenticity become cultural products that meet the needs of commercial tourism, as well as the construction of a supposed heritage. Such a situation leads to the invention of traditions and heritage for external consumption that meet visitors' conceptions of the other (Helu-Thaman; Cronin et al.).
   A good example of representing a non-Western destination at an international level is the Indian campaign Incredible India launched in 2002 for the European, Asian and Middle East markets (Kant). Undertaken by the Government of India to promote India Tourism all over the world, the campaign was released by Ogilvy and Mather India in media print, internet and television. My analysis wants to outline how the main themes of the campaign (yoga, Ayurveda and other spirituality-related concepts, Indian cultures and culinary traditions and festivals all around the country, the cultural heritage and the natural resources) have been developed through time in order to 'translate' the uniqueness of India for the Western tourist in the last 15 years. The campaign Incredible India has been developed and renewed over the past few years and is still ongoing. My analysis will follow two stages: in the first I will deal with linguistic and visual techniques that create a determinate idea of India as a tourist destination, in the second I will compare texts in English with their translation into Italian, and specifically the creation of a campaign aimed at Italian tourists.

AB This paper deals with a long forgotten German version of Volpone: Herr von Fuchs, written by the pre-Romantic playwright Ludwig Tieck in 1793 and unjustly neglected by editors, critics and theatrical directors alike. As an analysis of the play reveals, Herr von Fuchs is an accomplished and thought-provoking appropriation of a classical piece of drama which privileges the employment of Romantic irony as the best means to question widespread assumptions about political, educational, religious and aesthetic issues. It is the aim of this paper to grant Tieck's masterful example of creative translation the high recognition it deserves as a most accomplished German adaptation of Ben Jonson's Volpone.

AB This article focuses on Antony and Cleopatra, more particularly on the construction of the character of Antony, in order to address the problematic relationship between the Homeric tradition - in all its complexity - and early modern drama. The article proposes two processes of reception as complementary. First, Shakespeare, while working from North's Plutarch, may also have had in mind Mary Herbert's Antonius and/or Horace's Ode I. 15 and some of its early modern interpretations. Second, imaginative patterns, already latent in the Homeric text itself, may have filtered down to early modern English texts, with a special focus on the mediation of early modern translations of Homer into Latin.

TI Scanning strategy for surface defects evaluation of large fine optical
   components
SO OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY
AB Defects, such as scratches and digs etc., play an important role in quality control of fine optical components. Dark field microscopic imaging has become one of the most commonly means for surface defects detection. However, the imaging field of view is very limited compared with the increasing aperture of the test parts and sub-aperture scanning is usually employed to increase the detection aperture while ensuring the system resolution. The problems that classic "S" Shape Sub-Aperture (SSSA) strategy faces are the high positioning accuracy requirement for the translation stage and the time-consuming processing of huge number of sub-apertures. Herein, a Sub-Region and Sub-Aperture (SRSA) scanning strategy is proposed. It divides the aperture of test part into subregions. Within each sub-region, classic scanning strategies and stitching methods can be employed the same time when next sub-region is being scanned. The whole aperture of the test part can be obtained when all the subregions are stitched together. Thus the positioning accuracy requirement of translation stage is reduced from the whole aperture to a sub-region while most of the sub-aperture stitching and processing time is covered within the scanning process. The relationship between the positioning accuracy of translation stage and the sizes of subaperture/sub-region is discussed in detail. Comparison experiments show the superiority of the proposed SRSA scanning strategy with which large-aperture, high precision scanning detection of large-aperture optical components can be accomplished efficiently and economically.

When viewed through the lens of sociolinguistics, their romance is fraught with linguistic and pragmatic problems. Toshio and Hana speak different non-prestigious dialects, and also spend much of their interaction arguing. However, they eventually marry. Their path to marriage and the contents of their speech are also interesting from the perspective of cultural linguistics because they reflect competing cultural models for successful (happi endo) romances derived from the analysis of romance fiction. One type of romance reflects Japanese ideals of social contextualization, while the other is based on translations from English, reflecting cultural importation.

TI Identification of human Phosphatidyl Inositol 5-Phosphate 4-Kinase as an
   RNA binding protein that is imported into Plasmodium falciparum
SO BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
AB Plasmodium jalciparum is a causative agent for malaria and has a complex life cycle in human and mosquito hosts. Translation repression of specific set of mRNA has been reported in gametocyte stages of this parasite. A conserved element present in the 3'UTR of some of these transcripts was identified. Biochemical studies have identified components of the RNA storage and/or translation inhibitor complex but it is not yet clear how the complex is specifically recruited on the RNA targeted for translation regulation. We used the 3'UTR region of translationally regulated transcripts to identify Phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinase (PIP4K2A) as the protein that associates with these RNAs. We further show that recombinant PIP4K2A has the RNA binding activity and can associate specifically with Plasmodium 3'UTR RNAs. Immunostainings show that hPIP4K2A is imported into the Plasmodium parasite from RBC. These results identify a novel RNA binding role for PIP4K2A that may play a role in Plasmodium propagation.

TI TRADITIONS OF THE LAKE SCHOOL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES
SO TURISMO-ESTUDOS E PRATICAS
AB Objectives: The article is aimed at finding traditions of the Lake School - of William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Robert Southey - in the creative work of Robert Browning and Oscar Wilde. Methods: The comparative and historical, comparative and typological research methods, technics of the comparative analysis were used in the article. Findings: Traditions of William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Robert Southey are found in works by Robert Browning. "The Dance of Death" is created under the influence of Coleridge's war eclogue "Fire, Famine, and Slaughter", "The First-Born of Egypt" has features similar to Southey's dramas and "The Ruined Cottage" of Wordsworth; both works are characterized by the form of a drama monologue borrowed by Browning from Romantic poets. In the poem "Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came" Coleridge's innovation ("The Rime of the Ancient Mariner") and Wordsworth's poetic language ("Peter Bell") are notable. Browning actively realizes the ballad genre developed by Romantic poets in his poems. Traditions of the poem "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" by Samuel Taylor Coleridge are seen in "The Ballad of Reading Gaol" by Oscar Wilde. The thematic and structural interrelation is manifested in the characteristic imagery and use of close motives and literary details (common elements in the interpretation of suffering and forgiveness and ballad elements designed to emphasize tension and to add monotony and tediousness to descriptions of grief and torment). Novelty: The poems by Robert Browning, which attracted Russian translators at the beginning of the 20th century (Korney Chukovsky, Raul Rabinerson, etc.), caused the greatest interest among Russian translators [20] at the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries. The work of Oscar Wilde, being close to the peculiarities of the Russian perception of the world, also became popular in Russia what was manifested in the emergence of translations created by K.D.Balmont, M.F.Likiardopulo, V.Ya.Bryusov, A.I.Deutch at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries.

TI Cross-Cultural Adaptation and Validation of the Musculoskeletal Pain
   Intensity and Interference Questionnaire for Musicians of the Polish
   Population (MPIIQM-P)
SO MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR
AB Background: The aim of the study was the cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the Musculoskeletal Pain Intensity and Interference Questionnaire for Musicians.
   Material/Methods: The process consisted of the following stages: forward translation, backward translation, analysis by committee of experts, pretest of Polish-language version of questionnaire, and cross-cultural validation: psychometric evaluation. In the last step, a convenience sample of 31 professional orchestra musicians (professional experience 16.7 +/- 9.5 years) was used to validate the new tool. The primary study outcome measurements were construct validity and internal consistency as measured by exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and Cronbach's alpha, respectively.
   Results: A final Polish version of the questionnaire was developed. Using EFA, the 2-factor structure (pain intensity and pain interference) was obtained, taking into account all 9 items, explaining about 76% of the total variance. The pain interference and pain intensity factors were characterized by high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha 0.923 and 0.784, respectively). The lifetime prevalence of playing-related musculoskeletal disorders was 87%.
   Conclusions: Translation and a cross-cultural adaptation of the Polish version of the questionnaire was successfully completed. The results obtained show a correctly carried-out validation process, but further testing of the tool is suggested. The Polish-language version of the validated tool can be used in scientific and clinical practice. The next step would be to estimate cutoff values for severity of health status in orchestra musicians.

TI Silencing of the Target of Rapamycin Complex Genes Stimulates Tomato
   Fruit Ripening
SO MOLECULES AND CELLS
AB The target of rapamycin complex (TORC) plays a key role in plant cell growth and survival by regulating the gene expression and metabolism according to environmental information. TORC activates transcription, mRNA translation, and anabolic processes under favorable conditions, thereby promoting plant growth and development. Tomato fruit ripening is a complex developmental process promoted by ethylene and specific transcription factors. TORC is known to modulate leaf senescence in tomato. In this study, we investigated the function of TORC in tomato fruit ripening using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of the TORC genes, TOR, lethal with SEC13 protein 8 ( LST8), and regulatory-associated protein of TOR (RAPTOR). Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed that the expression levels of tomato TORC genes were the highest in the orange stage during fruit development in Micro-Tom tomato. VIGS of these TORC genes using stage 2 tomato accelerated fruit ripening with premature orange/red coloring and decreased fruit growth, when control tobacco rattle virus 2 (TRV2)-myc fruits reached the mature green stage. TORC-deficient fruits showed early accumulation of carotenoid lycopene and reduced cellulose deposition in pericarp cell walls. The early ripening fruits had higher levels of transcripts related to fruit ripening transcription factors, ethylene biosynthesis, carotenoid synthesis, and cell wall modification. Finally, the early ripening phenotype in Micro-Tom tomato was reproduced in the commercial cultivar Moneymaker tomato by VIGS of the TORC genes. Collectively, these results demonstrate that TORC plays an important role in tomato fruit ripening by modulating the transcription of various ripening-related genes.

TI Prognostic biomarkers of cutaneous melanoma
SO PHOTODERMATOLOGY PHOTOIMMUNOLOGY & PHOTOMEDICINE
AB Background/purpose: Melanomas account for only approximately 4% of diagnosed skin cancers in the United States but are responsible for the majority of deaths caused by skin cancer. Both genetic factors and ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure play a role in the development of melanoma. Although melanomas have a strong propensity to metastasize when diagnosed late, melanomas that are diagnosed and treated early pose a low mortality risk. In particular, the identification of patients with increased metastatic risk, who may benefit from early adjuvant therapies, is crucial, especially given the advent of new melanoma treatments. However, the accuracy of classic clinical and histological variables, including the Breslow thickness, presence of ulceration, and lymph node status, might not be sufficient to identify such individuals. Thus, there is a need for the development of additional prognostic melanoma biomarkers that can improve early attempts to stratify melanoma patients and reliably identify high-risk subgroups with the aim of providing effective personalized therapies.
   Methods: In our current work, we discuss and assess emerging primary melanoma tumor biomarkers and prognostic circulating biomarkers.
   Results: Several promising biomarkers show prognostic value (eg, exosomal MIA ( ie, melanoma inhibitory activity), serum S100B, AMLo signatures, and mRNA signatures); however, the scarcity of reliable data precludes the use of these biomarkers in current clinical applications.
   Conclusion: Further research is needed on several promising biomarkers for melanoma. Large-scale studies are warranted to facilitate the clinical translation of prognostic biomarker applications for melanoma in personalized medicine.

TI Henri- Rene Lenormand's reception in the early twentieth century Spain
SO ONOMAZEIN
AB Even if Lenormand's works are barely read or played in actual days, he was one of the avant-garde authors that generated more attention in the early twentieth century. The French author was enthusiastically welcomed by Spanish public. His works were frequently translated and played in Spanish theaters and intense debates were hold in literary reviews about how to interpret his characters. However, Lenormand's psychological conception of human being divided Spanish criticism in two groups: those who were in favour of his freudian proposals and those conservative critics who rejected Lenormand's novelties because they did not fit in the theatrical trends prevailing in early twentieth century Spain. Another controversial aspect in the Spanish reception of Lenormand's works was the alleged innovative nature of his theater: was he really an avant-garde author or did he merely relocate the great dramas of classical theater into the twentieth century? The aim of this paper is to study the diverse reactions stimulated by Lenormand's works among Spanish criticism.

TI The ERK-MNK-eIF4F signaling pathway mediates TPDHT-induced A549 cell
   death in vitro and in vivo
SO FOOD AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY
AB The eIF4E/eIF4G complex plays a central role in gene expression regulation during the initial stage of translation. This study aimed to determine if the novel small molecule compound, TPDHT, could disrupt the interaction of eIF4E/eIF4G, and if it could exhibit excellent antitumor activity in vivo without causing apparent toxicity effect. This study investigated the antitumor mechanism of TPDHT in vitro and in vivo. TPDHT showed significant anti-proliferative activity on human lung cancer A549 cells, and it induced G0/G1 cycle arrest. Moreover, TPDHT also induced A549 cell apoptosis through the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway. Our results indicate that TPDHT could disrupt the interaction of eIF4E/eIF4G, and the activity of eIF4F plays an important role in TPDHT-induced cell proliferation inhibition and apoptosis. Further research showed that TPDHT could inhibit the Ras/ERK/MNK pathway, and activation of the ERK pathway reversed TPDHT-induced cell proliferation inhibition and apoptosis. Taken together, our study findings indicated that TPDHT exerts an antitumor effect through an intrinsic apoptotic pathway controlled by the ERK/MNK/eIF4F pathway.

TI Mineral Grains, Dimples, and Hot Volcanic Organic Streams: Dynamic
   Geological Backstage of Macromolecular Evolution
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION
AB The hypothesis of hot volcanic organic stream as the most probable and geologically plausible environment for abiogenic polycondensation is proposed. The primary synthesis of organic compounds is considered as result of an explosive volcanic (perhaps, meteorite-induced) eruption. The eruption was accompanied by a shock wave propagating in the primeval atmosphere and resulting in the formation of hot cloud of simple organic compounds-aldehydes, alcohols, amines, amino alcohols, nitriles, and amino acids-products, which are usually obtained under the artificial conditions in the spark-discharge experiments. The subsequent cooling of the organic cloud resulted in a gradual condensation and a serial precipitation of organic compounds (in order of decreasing boiling point values) into the liquid phase forming a hot, viscous and muddy organic stream (named "lithorheos"). That stream-even if the time of its existence was short-is considered here as a geologically plausible environment for abiogenic polycondensation. The substances successively prevailing in such a stream were cyanamide, acetamide, formamide, glycolonitrile, acetonitrile. An important role was played by mineral (especially, phosphate-containing) grains (named "lithosomes"), whose surface was modified with heterocyclic nitrogen compounds synthesized in the course of eruption. When such grains got into hot organic streams, their surface catalytic centers (named "lithozymes") played a decisive role in the emergence, facilitation and maintenance of prebiotic reactions and key processes characteristic of living systems. Owing to its cascade structure, the stream was a factor underlying the formation of mineral-polymeric aggregates (named "lithocytes") in the small natural streambed cavities (dimples)-as well as a factor of their further spread within larger geological locations which played a role of chemo-ecological niches. All three main stages of prebiotic evolution (primary organic synthesis, polycondensation, and formation of proto-cellular structures) are combined within a common dynamic geological process. We suppose macromolecular evolution had an extremely fast, "flash" start: the period from volcanic eruption to formation of lithocyte "populations" took not million years but just several tens of minutes. The scenario proposed can be verified experimentally with a three-module setup working with principles of dynamic (flow) chemistry in its core element.

TI Maria Edgeworth's Private Theatricals: Patronage, Zara, and 1814
SO EUROPEAN ROMANTIC REVIEW
AB Maria Edgeworth's Patronage is one of a number of novels by women published in 1814 that refer to private theatricals, the most famous of which is Austen's Mansfield Park. Edgeworth was familiar with the custom of private theatricals in Ireland where her family performed plays and she also attended a performance at the celebrated season of amateur performances in Kilkenny that began in 1802 and lasted until 1819. In this article, I discuss the relevance of these Irish contexts for the intertextual and intertheatrical dimensions of the play staged in Patronage, Aaron Hill's 1735 tragedy Zara. A translation of Voltaire's Zaire (1732), Hill's tragedy was a stock piece in the theatrical repertoire and was included in the influential 1808 collection of plays entitled The British Theatre, edited by Edgeworth's friend Elizabeth Inchbald. I explore the relationship of Zara with another early Georgian tragedy mentioned in Patronage as a possible choice for the performers, Joseph Addison's Cato (1713). The theatricals episode is important for Edgeworth's exploration in Patronage of a number of intersecting themes that resonate with Edgeworth's own literary celebrity around 1814: the relationship between the novel and the theatre, gender and genre, and cosmopolitanism and translation.

TI Advanced technologies for molecular diagnosis of cancer: State of
   pre-clinical tumor-derived exosome liquid biopsies
SO MATERIALS TODAY BIO
AB Exosomes are membrane-defined extracellular vesicles (EVs) approximately 40-160 nm in diameter that are found in all body fluids including blood, urine, and saliva. They act as important vehicles for intercellular communication between both local and distant cells and can serve as circulating biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis. Exosomes play a key role in tumor metastasis, are abundant in biofluids, and stabilize biomarkers they carry, and thus can improve cancer detection, treatment monitoring, and cancer staging/prognosis. Despite their clinical potential, lack of sensitive/specific biomarkers and sensitive isolation/enrichment and analytical technologies has posed a barrier to clinical translation of exosomes. This review presents a critical overview of technologies now being used to detect tumor-derived exosome (TDE) biomarkers in clinical specimens that have potential for clinical translation.

TI The adjustment of gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) tonic subunits in
   Huntington's disease: from transcription to translation to synaptic
   levels into the neostriatum
SO NEURAL REGENERATION RESEARCH
AB gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), plays a key role in all stages of life, also is considered the main inhibitory neurotransmitter. GABA activates two kind of membrane receptors known as GABA(A) and GABA(B), the first one is responsible to render tonic inhibition by pentameric receptors containing alpha 4-6, beta 3, delta, or pl-3 subunits, they are located at perisynaptic and/or in extrasynaptic regions. The biophysical properties of GABA(A) tonic inhibition have been related with cellular protection against excitotoxic injury and cell death in presence of excessive excitation. On this basis, GABA(A) tonic inhibition has been proposed as a potential target for therapeutic intervention of Huntington's disease. Huntington's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a genetic mutation of the huntingtin protein. For experimental studies of Huntington's disease mouse models have been developed, such as R6/1, R6/2, HdhQ92, HdhQ150, as well as YAC128. In all of them, some key experimental reports are focused on neostriatum. The neostriatum is considered as the most important connection between cerebral cortex and basal ganglia structures, its cytology display two pathways called direct and indirect constituted by medium sized spiny neurons expressing dopamine D1 and D2 receptors respectively, they display strong expression of many types of GABA(A) receptors, including tonic subunits. The studies about of GABA(A) tonic subunits and Huntington's disease into the neostriatum are rising in recent years, suggesting interesting changes in their expression and localization which can be used as a strategy to delay the cellular damage caused by the imbalance between excitation and inhibition, a hallmark of Huntington's disease.

TI m(6)A Methyltransferase METTL3 Promotes the Progression of Primary Acral
   Melanoma via Mediating TXNDC5 Methylation
SO FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
AB m(6)A modification is one of the most important post-transcriptional modifications in RNA and plays an important role in promoting translation or decay of RNAs. The role of m(6)A modifications has been highlighted by increasing evidence in various cancers, which, however, is rarely explored in acral melanoma. Here, we demonstrated that m(6)A level was highly elevated in acral melanoma tissues, along with the expression of METTL3, one of the most important m(6)A methyltransferase. Besides, higher expression of METTL3 messenger RNA (mRNA) correlated with a higher stage in primary acral melanoma patients. Knockdown of METTL3 decreased global m(6)A level in melanoma cells. Furthermore, METTL3 knockdown suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of melanoma cells. In METTL3 knockdown xenograft mouse models, we observed decreased volumes and weights of melanoma tissues. Mechanistically, we found that METTL3 regulates certain m(6)A-methylated transcripts, thioredoxin domain containing protein 5 (TXNDC5), with the confirmation of RNA-seq, MeRIP-seq, and Western blot. These data suggest that METTL3 may play a key role in the progression of acral melanoma, and targeting the m(6)A dependent-METTL3 signaling pathway may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for management of patients of acral melanomas.

TI Songs Lost And Found: Katherine Philips's 'Pompey'S Ghost'
SO MUSIC & LETTERS
AB First staged in Dublin in 1663, Katherine Philips's Pompey, a translation of Corneille's Pompee, was the first play by a woman to be performed on the British stage. It was also pathbreaking in its dramatic incorporation of entr'acte songs, which Philips newly added. This essay explores the complex afterlife of one song from the play, Pompey's Ghost. It was her most widely disseminated text, though it largely circulated anonymously or attributed to other authors. Between 1663 and 1806 the song was set to music at least five times. One late seventeenth-century setting became popular in New England and was known there into the nineteenth century. By the late eighteenth century, through another setting, the song became identified as Scottish in origin. The tune to which Pompey's Ghost was sung in Scotland had been thought lost but can now be identified, restoring more of the song's complex reception history and significance.

AB Michael Tilby, A Miser's Daughter: Awareness of Balzac's Eugenie Grandet in Nineteenth-century England, RLC LXXXVI, no 3, juillet-septembre 2012, p. 273-282. Monolingual English readers had to wait until 1859 for a translation of Eugenie Grandet. Yet, in most cases unbeknown to them, London theatregoers had some familiarity with Balzac's story well before that. In 1835, John Millingen's free adaptation of La Fille de l'Avare, itself a dramatized re-working of Balzac's novel by Bayard and Duport, was briefly staged at London's Theatre Royal. It was followed by two further adaptations of the French play: J. V. Bridgeman's Love and Avarice (1853) and, much more successfully, John Palgrave Simpson's Daddy Hardacre (1857), which, in turn, spawned yet another play for the English stage. The present article traces the fortunes of these different versions and compares and contrasts the ways in which Balzac's story and characters are translated to English settings.

AB Stem-loop-binding proteins (SLBPs) have been revealed to interact with stem-loop of histones, and oocyte-specific and oocyte-preferential SLBP2 have been identified in vertebrates including Xenopus (S. tropicalis) and B. taurus to play a key role in histone translation regulation, but no oocyte-specific SLBPs have been characterized in fish. Here, we have identified and characterized the first fish oocyte-specific SLBP2 in Carassius gibelio. Its full-length cDNA contains 975 bp ORF encoding 324 amino acids. Firstly, the polyclonal antibody specific to C gibelio SLBP2 was prepared. Then, RT-PCR analysis and Western blot detection revealed its oocyte-specific and dynamic expression pattern during oogenesis and embryogenesis of C gibelio. Moreover, in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence localization observed its abundant expression in cortical alveolar stage oocytes and dynamic distribution in different stage oocytes. Altogether, our current data suggest that C. gibelio SLBP2 might play significant role in the early oogenesis and oocyte growth. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

   development at the early stage of Arabidopsis development
SO PLANT SCIENCE
AB Chloroplast biogenesis and development regulation have long been a focus of research; however, the underlying mechanisms of these processes have not yet been fully elucidated. Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins have been shown to play key roles in chloroplast development. Here, we identified a novel P-type PPR protein, Early Chloroplast Development 2 (ECD2), and the ecd2 mutant resulted in embryo lethality. The RNAi lines of ECD2 showed varying degrees of albino cotyledons and abnormal chloroplast development, but true leaves were similar to the wild-type. Further analysis revealed that ECD2 was responsible for chloroplast gene expression and group II intron splicing of several genes. Transcriptome analysis combined with quantitative real-time PCR showed that ECD2 was associated with the expression of ribosomal genes and accumulation of chloroplast ribosomes. Overall, our results indicate that ECD2 is critically important for early chloroplast development in cotyledon.

TI The ribosome in action: Tuning of translational efficiency and protein
   folding
SO PROTEIN SCIENCE
AB Marina V. Rodnina is the winner of the 2015 Hans Neurath Award.Abstract The cellular proteome is shaped by the combined activities of the gene expression and quality control machineries. While transcription plays an undoubtedly important role, in recent years also translation emerged as a key step that defines the composition and quality of the proteome and the functional activity of proteins in the cell. Among the different post-transcriptional control mechanisms, translation initiation and elongation provide multiple checkpoints that can affect translational efficiency. A multitude of specific signals in mRNAs can determine the frequency of translation initiation, choice of the open reading frame, global and local elongation velocities, and the folding of the emerging protein. In addition to specific signatures in the mRNAs, also variations in the global pools of translation components, including ribosomes, tRNAs, mRNAs, and translation factors can alter translational efficiencies. The cellular outcomes of phenomena such as mRNA codon bias are sometimes difficult to understand due to the staggering complexity of covariates that affect codon usage, translation, and protein folding. Here we summarize the experimental evidence on how the ribosometogether with the other components of the translational machinerycan alter translational efficiencies of mRNA at the initiation and elongation stages and how translation velocity affects protein folding. We seek to explain these findings in the context of mechanistic work on the ribosome. The results argue in favour of a new understanding of translation control as a hub that links mRNA homeostasis to production and quality control of proteins in the cell.

TI Cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the Kerlan-Jobe orthopedic
   clinic shoulder and elbow score for German-speaking overhead athletes
SO PHYSIOTHERAPY THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB Background The Kerlan-Jobe Orthopedic Clinic Shoulder and Elbow Score (KJOC) originally developed in English, assesses the functional status of the shoulder and elbow in overhead athletes. To date, no German version of the questionnaire exists. Objective The aim of the study was to translate and to culturally adapt the KJOC into German (KJOC-G) and to test its psychometric properties. Methods The first part of the study consisted of a translation and cross-cultural adaptation process which was performed in six stages according to international recommendations: Initial translations, synthesis, back translations, expert committee review, pretesting of the prefinal version, and final adaptations. Secondly, reliability, validity, and feasibility of the KJOC-G were assessed in German overhead athletes. Results The translation and adaptation process led to minor alterations due to cultural differences while maintaining the general structure and content of the original score. A total of 152 overhead athletes (age 25.0 +/- 6.6 years; 87 men/65 women) were included in the main analyses. The internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.93) and test-retest reliability (ICC2.1 = 0.94) of the overall questionnaire were excellent. Moderate correlations with the German version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire (r = -0.51,p< .05) as well as the DASH-sports module (r = -0.54,p< .05) suggest moderate construct validity. Known-group method analysis showed the ability of the KJOC-G to discriminate between actively playing symptomatic (score: 71.2 +/- 16.0) and asymptomatic (score: 93.1 +/- 8.7) athletes. Conclusion The KJOC-G score is valid, reliable, and suitable for assessing the functional shoulder and elbow status in German-speaking overhead athletes.

TI Agricultural cooperatives participating in vegetable supply chain
   integration: A case study of a trinity cooperative in China
SO PLOS ONE
AB Supply chain integration plays an important role in the development of the vegetable industry in terms of vegetable quality, vegetable safety, and vegetable security in rural China. This paper explores how agricultural cooperatives integrate the vegetable supply chain by taking a trinity cooperative as an example in China. It explains the translation concatenation of supply chain integration for this cooperative by constructing actor networks in four development stages, including the seed stage, start-up stage, development stage, and mature stage. The findings show that supply chain integration in production cooperation, supply & sales cooperation, and credit cooperation is a useful trinity cooperative model of supply chain integration for investigating vegetable supply chain integration through internal integration and external integration. This paper suggests that cooperatives in the vegetable supply chain should facilitate close coordination among different shareholders and further improve the efficiency of supply chain integration. The government should provide training opportunities and funding to encourage cooperatives to participate in supply chain integration within the vegetable industry.

TI Engineered EV-Mimetic Nanoparticles as Therapeutic Delivery Vehicles for
   High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer
SO CANCERS
AB Simple Summary In this review, we begin with the role of natural extracellular vesicles (EVs) in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). Then, we narrow our focus on the advantages of using EV-mimetic nanoparticles as a delivery vehicle for RNAi therapy and other chemotherapeutics. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges of the clinical translation of engineering EV mimetic drug delivery systems and the promising directions of further development. High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most lethal gynecological malignancy among women. Several obstacles impede the early diagnosis and effective treatment options for ovarian cancer (OC) patients, which most importantly include the development of platinum-drug-resistant strains. Currently, extensive efforts are being put into the development of strategies capable of effectively circumventing the physical and biological barriers present in the peritoneal cavity of metastatic OC patients, representing a late stage of gastrointestinal and gynecological cancer with an extremely poor prognosis. Naturally occurring extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been shown to play a pivotal role in progression of OC and are now being harnessed as a delivery vehicle for cancer chemotherapeutics. However, there are limitations to their clinical application due to current challenges in their preparation techniques. Intriguingly, there is a recent drive towards the use of engineered synthetic EVs for the delivery of chemotherapeutics and RNA interference therapy (RNAi), as they show the promise of overcoming the obstacles in the treatment of OC patients. This review discusses the therapeutic application of EVs in OC and elucidates the potential use of engineered EV-mimetic nanoparticles as a delivery vehicle for RNAi therapy and other chemotherapeutics, which would potentially improve clinical outcomes of OC patients.

TI Plastid-Localized EMB2726 Is Involved in Chloroplast Biogenesis and
   Early Embryo Development in Arabidopsis
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB Embryogenesis is a critical developmental process that establishes the body organization of higher plants. During this process, the biogenesis of chloroplasts from proplastids is essential. A failure in chloroplast development during embryogenesis can cause morphologically abnormal embryos or embryonic lethality. In this study, we isolated a T-DNA insertion mutant of the Arabidopsis gene EMBRYO DEFECTIVE 2726 (EMB2726). Heterozygous emb2726 seedlings produced about 25% albino seeds with embryos that displayed defects at the 32-cell stage and that arrested development at the late globular stage. EMB2726 protein was localized in chloroplasts and was expressed at all stages of development, such as embryogenesis. Moreover, the two translation elongation factor Ts domains within the protein were critical for its function. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the cells in emb2726 embryos contained undifferentiated proplastids and that the expression of plastid genome-encoded photosynthesis-related genes was dramatically reduced. Expression studies of DR5:GFP, pDRN:DRN-GFP, and pPIN1:PIN1-GFP reporter lines indicated normal auxin biosynthesis but altered polar auxin transport. The expression of pSHR:SHR-GFP and pSCR:SCR-GFP confirmed that procambium and ground tissue precursors were lacking in emb2726 embryos. The results suggest that EMB2726 plays a critical role during Arabidopsis embryogenesis by affecting chloroplast development, possibly by affecting the translation process in plastids.

SO MEDIA HISTORY
AB The 'cultural translator' is an individual who expresses the essence of entanglement in their career choices, moving between genres, media, or nations. This article suggests that the BBC producer and writer, Nesta Pain, was such an individual. Over the course of her career, Pain not only wrote and produced radio features and radio dramas but was also a successful journalist and author. She translated her experience in radio production onto the stage and on television by exploiting the different possibilities offered by these visual media-all evidence of her transmedial cultural translation. Further adding to the transgressive nature of her career, was her place as a woman in male-dominated radio production arenas.

   literary journalism
SO SOUTH EAST ASIA RESEARCH
CT 5th euroSEAS Conference
CY SEP, 2007
CL Univ Naples, Naples, ITALY
HO Univ Naples
AB Filipino film adaptations have always been historically and culturally linked to theatre and comic art. However, the relationship between printed literature and film adaptations remains underexamined. In addition, works of literary journalism are not generally sourced for film translation. For this reason, Mike de Leon's Kisapmata (Split-Second, 1981), an adaptation of Quijano de Manila's 1961 work of reportage, 'The House on Zapote Street', published in the Philippines Free Press and republished in the anthology Reportage on Crime: Thirteen Horror Happenings that Hit the Headlines (1977, 2009) is a celebrated rarity in Philippine film history. This paper analyses the translation of 'The House on Zapote Street' from English-language reportage into a film that combines family drama, crime thriller and political allegory. It tackles how the difference in language used in the film version has reshaped the visuality of the translation. It also interprets the appropriation of the techniques of literary journalism, such as the treatment of time and space, dramatic reconstruction and status details, to the screen. The intention is to show how a piece of literary journalism can be transposed visually and to understand the cultural significance that can be derived from this process of visual transformation.

TI Plastid ribosome protein L5 is essential for post-globular embryo
   development in Arabidopsis thaliana
SO PLANT REPRODUCTION
AB Plastid ribosomal proteins (PRPs) can play essential roles in plastid ribosome functioning that affect plant function and development. However, the roles of many PRPs remain unknown, including elucidation of which PRPs are essential or display redundancy. Here, we report that the nuclear-encoded PLASTID RIBOSOMAL PROTEIN L5 (PRPL5) is essential for early embryo development in A. thaliana, as homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the PRPL5 gene impairs chloroplast development and leads to embryo failure to develop past the globular stage. We confirmed the prpl5 embryo-lethal phenotype by generating a mutant CRISPR/Cas9 line and by genetic complementation. As PRPL5 underwent transfer to the nuclear genome early in the evolution of Embryophyta, PRPL5 can be expected to have acquired a chloroplast transit peptide. We identify and validate the presence of an N-terminal chloroplast transit peptide, but unexpectedly also confirm the presence of a conserved and functional Nuclear Localization Signal on the protein C-terminal end. This study highlights the fundamental role of the plastid translation machinery during the early stages of embryo development in plants and raises the possibility of additional roles of plastid ribosomal proteins in the nucleus.

TI Rethinking the Refugee Experience in Verbatim Theatre: Hospitality and
   Translation in Jessica Blank and Erik Jensen's Aftermath
SO MODERN DRAMA
AB Focusing on Jessica Blank and Erik Jensen's 2010 play Aftermath to conceptualize verbatim theatre more broadly, this essay explores problems of mediation among refugees, which mostly stem from their linguistic exchanges. While scholarship on verbatim theatre about refugees has tended to analyze encounters between refugees and dramatists (and through the dramatists, audiences), I demonstrate that power relations inherent in the language of hospitality can also be observed between refugees belonging to the same nation. I turn to Derrida's philosophy of hospitality and gift-giving to provide a theoretical framework for my inquiry. Especially when some refugees operate as mediators or translators who collaborate with dramatists, the reactions and opinions of other refugees can disclose the frictions among them and can foreground historical and cultural specificity within broader concerns about intercultural understanding. By challenging homogeneous depictions of refugees, this account offers an alternative to binary approaches to verbatim theatre.

TI Report of a Summer School. Translating Theatre: studies and theatre
   practice.
SO TEATRO E STORIA
AB This article traces the development of a discussion that arose during the seminar sessions of the Summer School Translation and Its Theories: Theatre, Arts, Philosophy, held by the Department of Excellence of Human Sciences of the University of L'Aquila in September 2019.
   Massimo Fusillo, Doriana Legge. A nude Macbeth. Language, sound, and flesh to translate the energy of evil. Taking as a starting point a well-known verse of Act 1, Scene VII in Macbeth, different examples are provided of how the figurative qualities of Shakespeare's baroque language are deposited in multiple translations that amplify the text's possibilities. A particular case in point is that of Macbettu, by Alessandro Serra, a performance where the translation into the Sardinian language is seen as the final expression of a much longer itinerary, an anthropological journey through the Barbagian Carnival, but not only. A work born from the stage, that gives new life to the poetic word as an epidermic reaction that is fully produced through the actor's body.
   Giovanni Carroni. On the translation of Macbettu. A letter. The actor Giovanni Carroni discusses his translation of Alessandro Serra's Macbettu, a work that does not start out from the written word, but from orality, from a "voice/bellow" made of flesh and blood. His translation process is supported by the lesson of Michelangelo Pirra, an anthropologist, writer and dramaturg, who in his novel Sos Sinnos (The Signs), written in Sardinian language, narrates the origin of the voice and words in a mythical dimension.
   Giorgina Pi. Translating our times. A Letter. The artist Giorgina Pi shares some thoughts about the creative process that led to Non non non non non abbastanza ossigeno (Not not not not not enough oxygen) in a letter written during the lockdown period. Linking the physical confinement of the present to that between past and future in Caryl Churchill's play, the theatre director unravels the thread that links political urgency to the translation and staging of a text written in 1971 and situated in the future of the time, 2010, which today has become the recent past.
   Paola Bono. Balancing Acts: translating Caryl Churchill. Paola Bono starts out from her experience of translation and collaboration to the staging of another text by Churchill, Seven Jewish Children, during the sit-ins at Teatro Valle, to trace the current lines of debate about translation for the theatre, seen as a "balancing act"; a definition that is made concrete through her practice as translator and editor of Churchill's works, a project that has currently produced its sixth volume.
   Serena Guarracino. Traps and hijackings: translating as a feminist. Serena Guarracino relates her personal experience of translating Caryl Churchill's work (Traps) through the filter of feminist translation, in the double function of a theoretical approach and a set of translation tools. Among the latter, she discusses in particular the idea of "hijack", an explicit choice of "infidelity" to the original text, and its hermeneutic potential in the practice of translating for the theatre.
   Angela Albanese. Translating for the Theatre. A comment on Polvere/Dust by Saverio la Ruina. The translation of theatre texts, written to be recited and acted out on the stage, is a somersault with increasing levels of difficulty. The author discusses the first level of difficulty: how to deliver meaning from one language to another, with reference to Polvere. Dialogo tra uomo e donna (Dust. Dialogue between man and woman) by the dramaturg and director Saverio la Ruina. She shows how even a text which is apparently "easy" to translate from the perspective of language, can present stringent intertextual constraints from the stylistic and pragmatic points of view.
   Thomas Haskell Simpson. Somersault with Quadruple twist: Seven Iterations in English of Marco Martinelli's Rumore di Acque. Letter. The contribution describes in chronological order seven different versions in English of Marco Martinelli/Teatro delle Albe's play Rumore di Acque (Noise In The Waters), published or produced in the United States between 2011 and 2015.

TI 'Whose side are you on?' The Slap (2011/2015)
SO Continuum-Journal of Media & Cultural Studies
AB Based on the best-selling 2008 novel by Christos Tsiolkas, the eight-part Australian television mini-series, The Slap (Matchbox Pictures, 2011), generated widespread local interest when it premiered nationally on ABC1 television. An ensemble drama, The Slap follows the repercussions of a fateful moment at a suburban barbecue in multicultural Melbourne when an angry adult slaps a misbehaving child that is not his own (but who, arguably, may have deserved the slap). Promoted with the tagline whose side are you on?' each of the eight episodes of the series advances the story from the viewpoint of a different character, in the process allowing barely concealed tensions of class, gender and ethnicity to rise to the surface. Upon the release of the series, Tsiolkas noted the specificity of the drama, stating that its approach to multiculturalism reflected the Australia that we do live in', but the unique programme format attracted international interest, NBC/Universal announcing that it was set to remake the series in the US with Matchbox Pictures' show runner, Tony Ayres, as a co-executive producer. This essay engages critical frameworks of adaptation and translation studies to interrogate various formats of The Slap. It considers not only the cross-cultural remaking of the Australian mini-series for US television, but also the adaptation of Tsiolkas' high profile novel to quality TV' - in ABC's description, a bold, provocative television drama series that forensically examines the mores and morality of contemporary middleclass life' (The Slap, Official ABC website). This analysis consists not only of an interrogation of the industrial situations and narrative strategies of the mini-series, but also - and given that Tsiolkas' novel was heralded locally and internationally as a comment upon contemporary (post-conservative government) Australia - an understanding of its reception contexts.

TI Constructing nation and identity in post-apartheid South Africa: a
   reading of Janice Honeyman's pantomime version of Peter Pan
SO POPULAR ENTERTAINMENT STUDIES
AB South African theatre has a long history of importing, translating, and adapting a variety of European scripts and stories and of staging them in different and innovative ways. Post-apartheid, the practice of theatrical imports and 'translations' continues in the productions produced on local stages. Pantomime is one such genre that has been transported to South Africa and that has been absorbed into the South African entertainment offerings. Little attention has been paid to the ideological implications of translating or reinterpreting pantomime texts into the postcolonial and post-apartheid South African context. This study aims to investigate the re-appropriation, translation and staging of colonial pantomime texts, formats and content in the postcolonial and post-apartheid South African theatrical context by exploring the ways in which Janice Honeyman's 2007 pantomime of Peter Pan: a Swashbuckling Adventure constructs nation and identity within this context. Tamara Bezuidenhout has had a 30 year career as a designer and director and is a postgraduate student and Marie-Heleen Coetzee is Head of Department, Department of Drama, University of Pretoria.

TI Role of The Two Highly Conserved Features of Initiator tRNAs in
   Initiation of Protein Synthesis in Eubacteria
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INDIAN NATIONAL SCIENCE ACADEMY
AB Regulation of translation represents a crucial step in gene expression. In this mini-review, we provide a brief outline of protein synthesis in bacteria, and discuss the participation of a special tRNA, the initiator tRNA (i-tRNA), in the different stages of the initiation step. The conserved features of the bacterial i-tRNA are located in its acceptor and anticodon stems. A Watson-Crick mismatch pair (1x72) at the top of the acceptor stem along with the 2:71 and 3:70 pairs, is important in formylation of the amino acid attached to the i-tRNA. The property of formylation facilitates i-tRNA binding to the 30S ribosome. The second feature of the presence of the three consecutive G:C pairs (29:41; 30:40 and 31:39 positions) in the anticodon stem, highly conserved in the i-tRNAs in all domains of life, plays a crucial role in the transition of i-tRNA through the different stages in formation of the 70S elongation competent complex from the 30S pre-initiation complex.

TI MEDIUM AND FIGURE IN ADAPTATION
SO ETUDES LITTERAIRES
AB As for all translations from a given medium to another, adapting a play for the silver screen is often studied from the inherently limited physical viewpoint peculiar to each medium. Yet, this essay adopts a different tack, drawing on Charles Sanders Peirce's pragmatism to focus instead on the figures that characterise each medium. How is one to ask about the nature of cinema nowadays ? Beginning with this difficult question, this essay will then define the medium before illustrating its contribution to cinematic epistemology through, for example, the all-important American. romantic comedy, a genre firmly rooted in, yet now freed from, the stage. This essay will end with a study of the Robert Lepage movie No, adapted from his namesake play.

TI Structure-Based Energetics of mRNA Decoding on the Ribosome
SO BIOCHEMISTRY
AB The origin of high fidelity in bacterial protein synthesis on the ribosome remains a fundamental unsolved problem despite available three-dimensional structures of different stages of the translation process. However, these structures open up the possibility of directly computing the energetics of tRNA selection that is required for an authentic understanding of fidelity in decoding. Here, we report extensive computer simulations that allow us to quantitatively calculate tRNA discrimination and uncover the energetics underlying accuracy in code translation. We show that the tRNA-mRNA interaction energetics varies drastically along the path from initial selection to peptide bond formation. While the selection process is obviously controlled by kinetics, the underlying thermodynamics explains the origin of the high degree of accuracy. The existence of both low- and high-selectivity states provides an efficient mechanism for initial selection and proofreading that does not require codon-dependent long-range structural signaling within the ribosome. It is instead the distinctly unequal population of the high-selectivity states for cognate and noncognate substrates that is the key discriminatory factor. The simulations reveal the essential roles played both by the 30S subunit conformational switch and by the common tRNA modification at position 37 in amplifying the accuracy.

TI Insight into the structure, physiological function, and role in cancer
   of m6A readers-YTH domain-containing proteins
SO CELL DEATH DISCOVERY
AB YT521-B homology (YTH) domain-containing proteins (YTHDF1-3, YTHDC1-2) are the most crucial part of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) readers and play a regulatory role in almost all stages of methylated RNA metabolism and the progression of various cancers. Since m6A is identified as an essential post-transcriptional type, YTH domain-containing proteins have played a key role in the m6A sites of RNA. Hence, it is of great significance to study the interaction between YTH family proteins and m6A-modified RNA metabolism and tumor. In this review, their basic structure and physical functions in RNA transcription, splicing, exporting, stability, and degradation as well as protein translation are introduced. Then we discussed the expression regulation of YTH domain-containing proteins in cancers. Furthermore, we introduced the role of the YTH family in cancer biology and systematically demonstrated their functions in various aspects of tumorigenesis and development. To provide a more institute understanding of the role of YTH family proteins in cancers, we summarized their functions and specific mechanisms in various cancer types and presented their involvement in cancer-related signaling pathways.

TI Italian Shakespeare
SO LINGUE ANTICHE E MODERNE
AB Audiences at Anglophone productions of Shakespeare bring to the theatre assumptions and expectations about the plays formed over many years of study and familiarity: English speakers grow up with Shakespeare texts. But familiarity can occasion rigidity about texts, and inhibit the degree of interpretive innovation possible in performance. Productions in translation for non-English-speaking audiences are often revelatory, presenting the plays as if new, as, indeed, they are to much of the audience. This essay considers Italian productions of Romeo and Juliet and Twelfth Night that for English speakers were strikingly original; in Italian, elements of the plays that to Anglophone audiences were over-familiar or melodramatic became high points of the drama. Shakespeare here became the essence of theatre, unconstrained by tradition or language.

TI Dissecting characteristics and dynamics of differentially expressed
   proteins during multistage carcinogenesis of human colorectal cancer
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
AB AIM: To discover novel biomarkers for early diagnosis, prognosis or treatment of human colorectal cancer.
   METHODS: iTRAQ 2D LC-MS/MS analysis was used to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the human colonic epithelial carcinogenic process using laser capture microdissection-purified colonic epithelial cells from normal colon, adenoma, carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma tissues.
   RESULTS: A total of 326 DEPs were identified, and four DEPs (DMBT1, S100A9, Galectin-10, and S100A8) with progressive alteration in the carcinogenic process were further validated by immunohistochemistry. The DEPs were involved in multiple biological processes including cell cycle, cell adhesion, translation, mRNA processing, and protein synthesis. Some of the DEPs involved in cellular process such as "translation" and "mRNA splicing" were progressively up-regulated, while some DEPs involved in other processes such as "metabolism" and "cell response to stress" was progressively downregulated. Other proteins with up-or down-regulation at certain stages of carcinogenesis may play various roles at different stages of the colorectal carcinogenic process.
   CONCLUSION: These findings give insights into our understanding of the mechanisms of colorectal carcinogenesis and provide clues for further investigation of carcinogenesis and identification of biomarkers.

TI The Shaping of Lu Xun's Public Image and His Portrait Images
SO FRONTIERS OF LITERARY STUDIES IN CHINA
AB After Lu Xun published "A Madman's Diary" (Kuangren riji) and "The True Story of Ah Q" (A Q zhengzhuan), through the active introduction by modern Korean mass media, Lu Xun enjoyed the highest popularity of all modern Chinese literary author in Korea Peninsula. "A Madman's Diary" translated by Ryu Sooin, was published in the magazine Donggwang (The oriental light) in 1927. Yang Baekhwa's translation of "The True Story of Ah Q" was serialized in The Chosun Ilbo (The Korea daily) in 1930. "Lu Xun and His Works" by Jeong Raedong, who conduct systematic criticism on Lu Xun's literature, was published in The Korea Daily in 1931. Lu Xun was thus differentiated from the so-called "Zhou Brothers" and claimed a place of his own as a representative Chinese writer. After that, Lu Xun's various works were translated into Korean, and he was acknowledged as "a Chinese literary master" and "a world-class writer" in the Korean literary world. Lu Xun's literature was hence widely acknowledged. Lee Kwangsoo even created another character called "Park Seondal" based on the motif of "Ah Q." With the development of mass media, people were eager to see Lu Xun's personal image. In the 1930s, major Korean media, such as The Shin Dong-a (The new East Asia), The Dong-a Ilbo (The East Asia daily), The Chosun Ilbo (The Korea daily), The Maeil Sinbo (The daily report), Chokwang (The morning light) and Samcheonli (Three thousand miles), successively published Lu Xun's portraits and photos, helping visualize Lu Xun's image and making great contributions to shaping the public image of Lu Xun and his literature. Through these major media in Korea, Lu Xun's works and his reputation became widely known, and his portrait images were also circulated. In February 1938, the Hwarang Garden Troupe staged the play The True Story of Ah Q. Considering the commercial nature of the theatre at that time, the public performance of The True Story of Ah Q indicates that Lu Xun and his works had achieved a solid foothold in the public mind. However, Korean people's access to Lu Xun's literature was blocked after March 1938, when Japanese imperialists imposed a blanket ideological clampdown. With the advent of liberation on August 15, 1945, the modern Korean public strongly needed Lu Xun's life experience and literary spirit as enlightenment. Hence, translation and research of Lu Xun's literary works became active again. In particular, in 1946, after the publication of The Collected Short Stories of Lu Xun (Volumes 1-2), jointly translated by Kim Kwangju and Lee Yongkyu, which included Lu Xun's major works, Korean people were able to gain a more systematic access to Lu Xun's literature. The inspirational value of Lu Xun's literature was re-ignited after Korea's liberation and independence. Lu Xun was thus once again praised as "a literary giant" and "a great writer."

TI 'A versifying maid of honour': Anne Finch and the libretto for 'Venus
   and Adonis'
SO REVIEW OF ENGLISH STUDIES
AB The anonymous libretto for John Blow's Venus and Adonis (c. 1683) may be the work of Anne Kingsmill, later Anne Finch, who was a Maid of Honour to the second Duchess of York at the time it was performed. Earlier musical dramas originating in that court, such as Ariane and Calisto, also have mythological plots, pastoral interludes, and an emphasis on female characters. While at court, Finch began a translation of Tasso's Aminto, a pastoral drama resembling Venus and Adonis. 'The Grove, a partially blotted manuscript poem 'Written when I was a Maid of Honour', has close verbal parallels with the musical work. A Maid of Honour would have reasons to conceal her authorship of this delicately erotic libretto. Finch later remarked on that she had been careful not 'to lett any attempts of mine in Poetry shew themselves whilst I livd in such a publick place as the Court, where every one would have made their remarks upon a Versifying Maid of Honour' Her efforts to efface or conceal later works with close resemblances to the opera suggest that she remained determined to cover her tracks. There are numerous verbal parallels between Venus and Adonis and later works by Finch, and if some of the phrases are conventional, their frequency points to Finch as the author of Venus and Adonis.

TI Phosphoproteomics Reveals the Effect of Ethylene in Soybean Root under
   Flooding Stress
SO JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH
AB Flooding has severe negative effects on soybean growth. To explore the flooding-responsive mechanisms in early-stage soybean, a phosphoproteomic approach was used. Two-day-old soybean plants were treated without or with flooding for 3, 6, 12, and 24 h, and root tip proteins were then extracted and analyzed at each time point. After 3 h of flooding exposure, the fresh weight of soybeans increased, whereas the ATP content of soybean root tips decreased. Using a gel-free proteomic technique, a total of 114 phosphoproteins were identified in the root tip samples, and 34 of the phosphoproteins were significantly changed with respect to phosphorylation status after 3 h of flooding stress. Among these phosphoproteins, eukaryotic translation initiation factors were dephosphorylated, whereas several protein synthesis-related proteins were phosphorylated. The mRNA expression levels of sucrose phosphate synthase 1F and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G were down-regulated, whereas UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase mRNA expression was up-regulated during growth but down-regulated under flooding stress. Furthermore, bioinformatic protein interaction analysis of flooding-responsive proteins based on temporal phosphorylation patterns indicated that eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G was located in the center of the network during flooding. Soybean eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G has homology to programmed cell death 4 protein and is implicated in ethylene signaling. The weight of soybeans was increased with treatment by an ethylene-releasing agent under flooding condition, but it was decreased when plants were exposed to an ethylene receptor antagonist. These results suggest that the ethylene signaling pathway plays an important role, via the protein phosphorylation, in mechanismsof plant tolerance to the initial stages of flooding stress in soybean root tips.

TI Decision technologies as normative instruments: Exposing the values
   within
SO PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING
AB Objective: Describe some of the implicit normative and value judgments made in decision technologies development and use.
   Methods: Using conceptual analysis of published models, we first outline some of the background assumptions of the knowledge translation/evidence-based medicine view of decision technologies. We then describe how normative judgments are embedded in decision technology development and use, drawing from empirical normative analysis of qualitative interviews with clinical practice guidelines developers (n = 18) and users (n = 17) in Canada and the UK.
   Results: Normative judgments are made in at least three stages of decision technologies' "life cycle": (1) in the identification of contexts where decisions are seen as requiring support; (2) in determining what type of information and options should be part of the content of decision technologies; (3) in the negotiation between different actors regarding how effectiveness of decision technologies should be judged. These findings contrast with the knowledge translation/evidence-based medicine picture of decision technologies as neutral carriers of facts, or 'pure' synthesis of research evidence.
   Conclusion: Normative judgments are at play throughout the life cycle of decision technology development and use. References to scientific notions of truth and validity in the knowledge translation/evidence-based medicine model tend to overlook the socio-political dimension of decision technology development and implementation, as well as the contested nature of what "good decision" these technologies aim to support.
   Practice implications: Empirical normative analysis is an important research tool to better understand the values, interests and power relationships embedded in decision technologies. Such lines of inquiry could foster a more open debate among stakeholders - including patients and members of the public regarding the norms promoted by practice guidelines and patient decision aids. It also offers new insights in understanding the problem of implementing decision technologies in clinical practice. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The Portuguese version of the musculoskeletal pain intensity and
   interference questionnaire for musicians (MPIIQM-Pt): Translation,
   cultural adaptation, and multicenter validation study in professional
   orchestra musicians
SO PAIN PRACTICE
AB Objectives: We aim to assess the validity and reliability of the Musculoskeletal Pain Intensity and Interference Questionnaire for Musicians (MPIIQM) and to add to its cross-cultural adaptation process by translating, culturally adapting, and validating the MPIIQM into European Portuguese language in the population of Portuguese musicians. Methods: A Portuguese version of the MPIIQM (MPIIQM-Pt) was created through a process of forward and back translation, pilot testing, and cultural adaptation by expert panel evaluation. The psychometric evaluation was performed in a validation sample of 134 musicians, at baseline and after 7 days. Results: The high degree of internal consistency and the substantial test-retest reliability coefficients were demonstrated for each subscale (alpha = 0.896 and ICC = 0.997 for "pain intensity, " and alpha = 0.879 and ICC = 0.999 for "pain interference, " respectively). Exploratory factor analysis indicated two-factor structure (pain intensity and interference) that explained 75.5% of the variance. Both convergent and divergent validity are well demonstrated, confirming more than 90% of the previously defined hypotheses regarding correlations with other measures. Discussion: MPIIQM-Pt is the first validated questionnaire to evaluate pain among Portuguese musicians. It showed excellent psychometric properties, both in terms of internal consistency, test-retest reliability, factor analysis, and construct validity. Therefore, it is a valid and reliable tool suitable for both research and clinical practice purposes. MPIIQM-Pt will allow the development of more robust studies on pain among musicians and the improved assessment and monitoring of pain in this population, filling an important gap in this field of Pain Medicine.

TI EIF5A expression and its role as a potential diagnostic biomarker in
   hepatocellular carcinoma
SO JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB Introduction and objectives: Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (EIF5A) is a member of the identified eIF family and played an important role in cell proliferation. There are few studies about the correlation between EIF5A and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
   Materials and methods: We evaluated the expression of the EIF5A in human HCC cell lines and tissues by western blot analysis. Immunohistochemistry analysis of EIF5A was performed on a tissue microarray including 10 normal liver samples and 90 pathological section of HCC. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was introduced to obtain an optimal cut-off score for EIF5A positive expression.
   Results: Western blot results showed that EIF5A was highly expressed in HCC cell lines and tissues. Based on ROC curve analysis, 1/10 (10.0%) of normal hepatic tissues and 67/90 (74.4%) of HCC tissues were tested positive for EIF5A expression, which indicated that EIF5A were significantly up-regulated in HCC tissues compared with normal liver tissues (chi(2)=17.177, P<0.001). Furthermore, expression of EIF5A was significantly correlated with histological grade (P=0.048), clinical stage (P=0.003) and pT stage (P=0.003) but not correlated with sex (P=0.617) and age (P=0.831).
   Conclusions: In our study, we demonstrated the expression of EIF5A is closely correlated with HCC. In consideration of its relationship with clinicopathological parameters including histological grade, clinical stage and pT stage of HCC, EIF5A could be a potential biomarker.

TI In-depth study of lin-28 suggests selectively conserved let-7
   independent mechanism in Drosophila
SO GENE
AB Lin-28 is a conserved RNA-binding protein that is involved in a wide range of developmental processes and pathogenesis. At the molecular level, Lin-28 blocks the maturation of let-7 and regulates translation of certain mRNA targets. In Drosophila, Lin-28 is reported to play a role in oogenesis, muscle formation, and the symmetric division of adult intestinal stem cells. In this study, we characterized Drosophila Lin-28 through a detailed examination of its temporal and spatial expression. Lin-28 is specifically expressed in embryonic nervous and cardiac systems. However, loss or gain of lin-28 function does not cause any abnormality during embryonic development. Instead, the ubiquitous overexpression of Lin-28 leads to lethality from late larval stage to pupal stage, and eye-specific overexpression causes severe cell loss. The ectopic expression of human Lin28A has the same effect as Drosophila Lin-28, indicating functional conservation in Lin-28 orthologs. We also examined the effect of Lin-28 on let-7 biogenesis through the mutant and overexpression analysis. Lin-28 does not block the production of let-7 in Drosophila, which suggests the let-7 independent pathway as a molecular mechanism of Lin-28.

TI Thomas Francklin's Minos: A Recently Discovered Imitation of Lucian from
   the 1770s
SO STUDIES IN PHILOLOGY
AB Thomas Francklin's comic two-act play, Minos, was neither performed nor published and only known from Francklin's correspondence with David Garrick in the 1770s. A manuscript of this play has recently come to light, filling in a gap in theater history and revealing the last significant imitation of Lucian in the eighteenth century. This article describes and analyzes the play and its satirical targets, contextualizes the play in Francklin's oeuvre, and explains its relationship to other imitations and translations of Lucian. I suggest that one reason this play remained unperformed was that the combination of classical themes and performable drama found in Minos was no longer appealing to theater audiences, signaling the decline of classical imitation in the later eighteenth century.

TI Circular RNAs and hereditary bone diseases
SO INTRACTABLE & RARE DISEASES RESEARCH
AB Circular RNA (circRNA) is a non-linear form of RNA derived from exonic, intronic, and exon-intron gene regions. circRNAs are characterized by covalent closed loops, highly stable nuclease resistance, and specific expression in species and developmental stages. CircRNA molecules have been identified as playing roles in the regulation of cell transcription, transcriptional expression after translation, interactions with microRNAs, and protein coding. A high stability and tissue-and disease-specific expression allow circRNAs to serve as potential biomarkers both for diseases and prognosis. CircRNAs function in bone remodeling by directly participating in bone-related signaling pathways and by forming the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA axis. Studies have seldom reported on the low incidence of circRNAs in genetic bone disorders. The current study reviews the characteristics of circRNAs and recent research on their role in rare hereditary bone diseases.

TI PARP12 regulates mouse oocyte meiotic maturation
SO JOURNAL OF CELLULAR PHYSIOLOGY
AB Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) is an important post-translational modification of proteins that involves the transfer of ADP-ribose moieties, and plays important roles in many biological processes including DNA repair, gene expression, RNA processing, ribosome biogenesis, and protein translation. Though it is accepted that PARylation is crucial for oocyte maturation, little is known about how Mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation (MARylation) regulates this process. Here, we report that Parp12, a mon(ADP-ribosyl) transferase of poly(ADP-ribosyl) polymerase (PARP) family, was highly expressed at all stages of oocytes during meiotic maturation. At germinal vesicle (GV) stage, PARP12 was mainly distributed in cytoplasm. Interestingly, PARP12 formed granular aggregation near to spindle poles during metaphase I (MI) and metaphase II (MII). PARP12 depletion results in abnormal spindle organization and chromosome misalignment in mouse oocytes. Chromosome aneuploidy frequency in PARP12 knockdown oocytes was significantly increased. Importantly, PARP12 knockdown triggers activation of spindle assembly checkpoint as shown by active BUBR1 in PARP12-KD MI oocytes. Besides, F actin was significantly attenuated in PARP12-KD MI oocytes which may affect the asymmetric division process. Transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that PARP12 depletion disrupts transcriptome homeostasis. Collectively, our results showed that the maternally expressed mono(ADPribosyl) transferases PARP12 was essential for oocyte meiotic maturation in mouse.

TI Plasma MicroRNA as a novel diagnostic
SO CLINICA CHIMICA ACTA
AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, single-stranded, endogenous, non-coding RNAs necessary for proper gene expression. Their mechanism of action controls translation by base-pairing with target messenger RNA (mRNAs) thus leading to translation blockage or mRNA degradation. Many studies have shown that miRNAs play pivotal roles in cancer, cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative disorders. The lack of blood-derived biomarkers and those markers of poor specificity and sensitivity significantly impact the ability to diagnose in general and at early disease stage specifically. As such, new, non-invasive and quantifiable biomarkers are needed. As post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, miRNAs have been confirmed to be notably stable in cells, tissues and body fluids. These and other advantages make miRNAs ideal candidates as potential biomarkers and early experimental findings support this finding. This review examines the use of miRNAs as biomarkers in cancer, neurodegenerative, cardiovascular and liver disease and viral infection.

TI mTOR and other effector kinase signals that impact T cell function and
   activity
SO IMMUNOLOGICAL REVIEWS
AB T cells play important roles in autoimmune diseases and cancer. Following the cloning of the T cell receptor (TCR), the race was on to map signaling proteins that contributed to T cell activation downstream of the TCR as well as co-stimulatory molecules such as CD28. We term this "canonical TCR signaling" here. More recently, it has been appreciated that T cells need to accommodate increased metabolic needs that stem from T cell activation in order to function properly. A central role herein has emerged for mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). In this review we briefly cover canonical TCR signaling to set the stage for discussion on mTOR signaling, mRNA translation, and metabolic adaptation in T cells. We also discuss the role of mTOR in follicular helper T cells, regulatory T cells, and other T cell subsets. Our lab recently uncovered that "tonic signals", which pass through proximal TCR signaling components, are robustly and selectively transduced to mTOR to promote baseline translation of various mRNA targets. We discuss insights on (tonic) mTOR signaling in the context of T cell function in autoimmune diseases such as lupus as well as in cancer immunotherapy through CAR-T cell or checkpoint blockade approaches.

TI RRP15 deficiency induces ribosome stress to inhibit colorectal cancer
   proliferation and metastasis via LZTS2-mediated beta-catenin suppression
SO CELL DEATH & DISEASE
AB Ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) plays a pivotal role in carcinogenesis by regulating protein translation and stress response. Here, we find that RRP15, a nucleolar protein critical for RiBi and checkpoint control, is frequently upregulated in primary CRCs and higher RRP15 expression positively correlated with TNM stage (P < 0.0001) and poor survival of CRC patients (P = 0.0011). Functionally, silencing RRP15 induces ribosome stress, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis, resulting in suppression of cell proliferation and metastasis. Overexpression of RRP15 promotes cell proliferation and metastasis. Mechanistically, ribosome stress induced by RRP15 deficiency facilitates translation of TOP mRNA LZTS2 (Leucine zipper tumor suppressor 2), leading to the nuclear export and degradation of beta-catenin to suppress Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in CRC. In conclusion, ribosome stress induced by RRP15 deficiency inhibits CRC cell proliferation and metastasis via suppressing the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, suggesting a potential new target in high-RiBi CRC patients.

SO STUDIES IN SPANISH & LATIN AMERICAN CINEMAS
AB The article analyses the translation to cinema of Los de la mesa 10 (Feldman, 1960), based on Osvaldo Dragun's play. The article addresses this relationship through four axes: the coincidental interests between the director and the autor based on obtaining a horizontal consecration; the filmic approach to the parameters of modernity through staging decisions; the representation of the city and the inclusion of recognizable spaces; and the role played by the critics at the time of making known the proposal and the confrontation that they maintained with the power field. The chosen methodological approach seeks to reconstruct the facts from a double perspective: presenting attention to both the internal aspects and their production conditions and the context in which the proposal was made known and the reactions generated among the specialized receivers.

TI Rasputin Functions as a Positive Regulator of Orb in Drosophila
   Oogenesis
SO PLOS ONE
AB The determination of cell fate and the establishment of polarity axes during Drosophila oogenesis depend upon pathways that localize mRNAs within the egg chamber and control their on-site translation. One factor that plays a central role in regulating on-site translation of mRNAs is Orb. Orb is a founding member of the conserved CPEB family of RNA-binding proteins. These proteins bind to target sequences in 3' UTRs and regulate mRNA translation by modulating poly(A) tail length. In addition to controlling the translation of axis-determining mRNAs like grk, fs(1)K10, and osk, Orb protein autoregulates its own synthesis by binding to orb mRNA and activating its translation. We have previously shown that Rasputin (Rin), the Drosophila homologue of Ras-GAP SH3 Binding Protein (G3BP), associates with Orb in a messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complex. Rin is an evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding protein believed to function as a link between Ras signaling and RNA metabolism. Here we show that Orb and Rin form a complex in the female germline. Characterization of a new rin allele shows that rin is essential for oogenesis. Co-localization studies suggest that Orb and Rin form a complex in the oocyte at different stages of oogenesis. This is supported by genetic and biochemical analyses showing that rin functions as a positive regulator in the orb autoregulatory pathway by increasing Orb protein expression. Tandem Mass Spectrometry analysis shows that several canonical stress granule proteins are associated with the Orb-Rin complex suggesting that a conserved mRNP complex regulates localized translation during oogenesis in Drosophila.

TI The emergence of the knowledge economy and the changing role of
   translators as knowledge brokers: a case of the sharing economy in China
SO TRANSLATOR
AB Before the 1970s, gross national product or gross domestic product was used to measure national development, but this indicator has been criticized for over-emphasizing material wealth. This paper begins by discussing the 'quality of life' and 'human capability' concepts, which may provide a broader view of development. Endogenous-Growth Theory of knowledge and innovation is then introduced, offering an alternative to the classical economic models of development such as the Stages-of-Economic-Growth Model and the Exogenous-Growth Model. The aim is to explain the role played by sharing, reusing and expanding knowledge through communication and mobile technology in the sharing economy. In particular, the introduction of Uber into China is used as a case study to illustrate that, in future, translators (and translator trainers) may need to focus more on mediating between sources of knowledge and users of knowledge as well as building links between different stakeholders.

TI Simulation of English speech emotion recognition based on transfer
   learning and CNN neural network
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS
AB The difference between English and Chinese expressions is that English emphasizes the stress of syllables, so the recognition of English speech emotions plays an important role in learning English. This study uses transfer learning as the technical support to study English speech emotion recognition. The acoustic model based on weight transfer has two different training strategies: single-stage training and two-stage training strategy. By comparing the performance of the English speech emotion recognition model based on CNN neural network and the model proposed in this paper, the statistical comparison data is drawn into a statistical graph. The research results show that transfer learning has certain advantages over other algorithms in English speech emotion recognition. In the subsequent teaching and real-time translation equipment research, transfer learning can be applied to English models.

TI Mammalian UPF3A and UPF3B can activate nonsense-mediated mRNA decay
   independently of their exon junction complex binding
SO EMBO JOURNAL
AB Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is governed by the three conserved factors-UPF1, UPF2, and UPF3. While all three are required for NMD in yeast, UPF3B is dispensable for NMD in mammals, and its paralog UPF3A is suggested to only weakly activate or even repress NMD due to its weaker binding to the exon junction complex (EJC). Here, we characterize the UPF3A/B-dependence of NMD in human cell lines deleted of one or both UPF3 paralogs. We show that in human colorectal cancer HCT116 cells, NMD can operate in a UPF3B-dependent and -independent manner. While UPF3A is almost dispensable for NMD in wild-type cells, it strongly activates NMD in cells lacking UPF3B. Notably, NMD remains partially active in cells lacking both UPF3 paralogs. Complementation studies in these cells show that EJC-binding domain of UPF3 paralogs is dispensable for NMD. Instead, the conserved "mid" domain of UPF3 paralogs is consequential for their NMD activity. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the mammalian UPF3 proteins play a more active role in NMD than simply bridging the EJC and the UPF complex.

TI Deep Insights in Circular RNAs: from biogenesis to therapeutics
SO BIOLOGICAL PROCEDURES ONLINE
AB Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have emerged as a universal novel class of eukaryotic non-coding RNA (ncRNA) molecules and are becoming a new research hotspot in RNA biology. They form a covalent loop without 5 cap and 3 ' tail, unlike their linear counterparts. Endogenous circRNAs in mammalian cells are abundantly conserved and discovered so far. In the biogenesis of circRNAs exonic, intronic, reverse complementary sequences or RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play a very important role. Interestingly, the majority of them are highly conserved, stable, resistant to RNase R and show developmental-stage/tissue-specific expression. CircRNAs play multifunctional roles as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, regulators of transcription and post-transcription, parental gene expression and translation of proteins in various diseased conditions. Growing evidence shows that circRNAs play an important role in neurological disorders, atherosclerotic vascular disease, and cancer and potentially serve as diagnostic or predictive biomarkers due to its abundance in various biological samples. Here, we review the biogenesis, properties, functions, and impact of circRNAs on various diseases.

TI Heywood's Ages and Chapman's Homer: nothing in common?
SO CLASSICAL RECEPTIONS JOURNAL
AB In the same period when George Chapman published his translation of the Iliad, Thomas Heywood was offering Homer's 'treasure' to the reputedly lowbrow audience of the Red Bull Theatre. Though the Ages are based on multiple sources, Heywood emphasizes Homer's importance by using him as a chorus in three of the five plays. Starting with the notion that Heywood's Ages have been understudied and underestimated, this article offers a new angle on those plays by challenging the idea that Heywood and Chapman stand at opposite ends of the literary and cultural spectrum - Chapman's elitist presentation contrasting with Heywood's vulgarizing enterprise. Rather, it seeks to obtain a fuller perception of the Ages by relocating them within the network of interactions that was the literary and theatrical milieu of the time. The article shows that Heywood engages with Homer in a variety of ways, both mediated and unmediated. It highlights Heywood's interest in Chapman, which suggests the Ages may be a dramatic response to his rival's translation. Finally, it looks at how both English authors use Homer for self-fashioning purposes, and how the stage character sheds light not only on the playwright but on the Red Bull audience and their skills.

These trips were real literary campaigns in which the writer had to act as a literary agent, a profession that had just began to be consolidated. Thanks to the intervention of numerous personalities, in particular Fernando Leon y Castillo and Adolfo Calzado, among others, Don Benito managed to overcome many difficulties and to internationalize his novels (Misericordia, Gloria.) and some of his dramas. In this sense, Electra was the work that allowed him to cross the borders of the Pyrenees.

TI Characterization and Developmental Expression Patterns of Four Hexamerin
   Genes in the Bumble Bee, Bombus terrestris (Hymenoptera: Apidae)
SO JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE
AB Hexamerins are members of the hemocyanin superfamily and play essential roles in providing amino acids and energy for the nonfeeding stages of insects. In this study, we cloned and analyzed the expression patterns of four hexamerin genes (hex 70a, hex 70b, hex 70c, and hex 110) at different worker development stages and queen diapause statuses in the bumble bee, Bombus terrestris. The results of this study showed that hex 110 has the longest open reading frame (ORF; 3,297 bp) compared to the ORFs of hex 70a (2,034 bp), hex 70b (2,067 bp), and hex 70c (2,055 bp). The putative translation product of Hex 70a, Hex 70b, Hex70c, and Hex 110 has 677, 688, 684, and 1,098aa with predicted molecular mass of 81.13, 79.69, 81.58, and 119 kDa. In the development stages of workers, the expression levels of hex 70a, hex 70b, and hex 70c increased gradually from the larval stage and exhibited high expression levels at the pink eyed and brown eyed pupae stage, whereas hex 110 exhibited the highest expression level at the larval period. Four hexamerin genes were highly expressed at the prediapause status of queen (P < 0.05), and compared to the eclosion queen, the lowest upregulation was 3.7-fold, and the highest upregulation was 1,742-fold. The expression levels of hex 70b, hex 70c, and hex 110 at diapause were significantly higher than those at postdiapause (P < 0.05). In conclusion, hexamerins may play important roles in queen diapause and metamorphosis of larval and pupal stages.

TI Building on the Ccr4-Not architecture
SO BIOESSAYS
AB In a recent issue of Nature Communications Ukleja and co-workers reported a cryo-EM 3D reconstruction of the Ccr4-Not complex from Schizosaccharomyces pombe with an immunolocalization of the different subunits. The newly gained architectural knowledge provides cues to apprehend the functional diversity of this major eukaryotic regulator. Indeed, in the cytoplasm alone, Ccr4-Not regulates translational repression, decapping and deadenylation, and the Not module additionally plays a positive role in translation. The spatial distribution of the subunits within the structure is compatible with a model proposing that the Ccr4-Not complex interacts with the 50 and 30 ends of target mRNAs, allowing different functional modules of the complex to act at different stages of the translation process, possibly within a circular constellation of the mRNA. This work opens new avenues, and reveals important gaps in our understanding regarding structure and mode of function of the Ccr4-Not complex that need to be addressed in the future.

TI Regulatory role of mitochondrial genes in the tenderisation of lamb meat
   during postmortem ageing
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The tenderness of mutton is one of the qualities of prime lamb meat. This study investigated the effects of postmortem time on different meat quality parameters and examined the transcriptome involved in the tenderisation of lamb meat during postmortem ageing. Results showed that the pH value and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels considerably decreased in the early stage (0-4 days) of postmortem ageing, whereas caspases-3 activities increased (0-4 days). The pH value notably increased in the later stage (4-8 days), while ATP levels and caspases-3 activities decreased (4-8 days). The transcriptional changes at the early stage of ageing (0-4 days) play important regulatory roles in translation and hydrogen transmembrane transport. Mitochondrial genes, ATP synthase F0 subunit 6, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, cytochrome c oxidase subunit II, and cytochrome b were identified as the core genes associated with Tan lamb tenderness. In conclusion, mitochondrial genes most likely contribute to lamb meat tenderness as they affect the activation of caspase-3.

SO JOURNAL OF CELLULAR PHYSIOLOGY
AB The incidence of bladder cancer (BCa) in China is the highest among genitourinary system tumors, and its progression is affected by multitudinous pathways, of which cell cycle progress plays an important role. This study screened and enriched differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from four gene expression profiles using bioinformatics analysis methods. The enrichment and analysis of gene function showed that these genes were highly correlated with cell cycle regulation. Identification of candidate small molecules was conducted to evaluate the application of clinical transformationin these DEGs. Prognostic and stage-related expression analysis further sorted five highly expressed genes associated with worse prognosis and higher stages in patients with BCa. Further analysis revealed their interaction in cell cycle regulation and genetical alteration. Meanwhile, we validated the elevated expression of these genes through transcription and translation levels. Taking the results together, we could infer that these five genes are valuable in diagnosis, prediction, and providing candidate therapeutic targets for patients with BCa in different stages.

TI Morphology of composition functions in persian sentences through a newly
   proposed classified fuzzy method and center of gravity defuzzification
   method
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS
AB Since data mining plays a key role in a variety of research areas including audio processing, text processing, and machine translation, research efforts in the Persian language has been seriously challenging. Due to difficulties such as clinging letters and absence of vowels in words, research in the Persian language has progressed at a far slower pace than in the English language. In spite of all complexities, it is indispensable to conduct further studies on the Persian morphology. Moreover, one of the widely adopted techniques is statistical, where a major drawback is intensive computational load. For that purpose, this research project intended to propose a "classified, statistical" method. Compared to the solely statistical method, the new one offers the advantage of 80% reduction in computation load at each stage against previous stages. This in turn enhances the essential computation speed. The results indicated that sequencing and classification of stages in Persian proved more successful by about 13% against the combined fuzzy and classified method.

AB Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular apicomplexan that causes toxoplasmosis in humans and animals. Central to its dissemination and pathogenicity is the ability to rapidly divide in the tachyzoite stage and infect any type of nucleated cell. Adaptation to different cell contexts requires high plasticity in which heat shock proteins (Hsps) could play a fundamental role. Tgj1 is a type I Hsp40 of T. gondii, an ortholog of the DNAJA1 group, which is essential during the tachyzoite lytic cycle. Tgj1 consists of a J-domain, ZFD, and DNAJ_C domains with a CRQQ C-terminal motif, which is usually prone to lipidation. Tgj1 presented a mostly cytosolic subcellular localization overlapping partially with endoplasmic reticulum. Protein-protein Interaction (PPI) analysis showed that Tgj1 could be implicated in various biological pathways, mainly translation, protein folding, energy metabolism, membrane transport and protein translocation, invasion/pathogenesis, cell signaling, chromatin and transcription regulation, and cell redox homeostasis among others. The combination of Tgj1 and Hsp90 PPIs retrieved only 70 interactors linked to the Tgj1-Hsp90 axis, suggesting that Tgj1 would present specific functions in addition to those of the Hsp70/Hsp90 cycle, standing out invasion/pathogenesis, cell shape motility, and energy pathway. Within the Hsp70/Hsp90 cycle, translation-associated pathways, cell redox homeostasis, and protein folding were highly enriched in the Tgj1-Hsp90 axis. In conclusion, Tgj1 would interact with a wide range of proteins from different biological pathways, which could suggest a relevant role in them.

TI Intergenre and Intercultural Relations of Jeorge Colman's "The Jealous
   Wife": From Fielding to Desforges
SO NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
AB The popular playwright of the 18th century G. Colman the Elder is known in the history of English drama as the author of two famous comedies - The Jealous Wife and The Clandestine Marriage (in collaboration with D. Garrick). Though neither of these plays was ever considered a masterpiece Colman left his mark in the European drama of the 18th century, mostly due to his comedy The Jealous Wife, which generated many adaptations and imitations on the continent. As the author of the article shows, one of the main reasons of the play's appeal to the imitators was that Colman rather aptly adapted in it the well-known novel by H. Fielding - The History of Tom Jones, contributing thus to the perpetuation on the scene of the character of the "good-natured rake", going back to the hero of the book and gaining great popularity in the English comedy of the second half of the 18th century. In the literature of this period The Jealous Wife opens a series of dramatic adaptations of the novel (mainly foreign), and some of them were presumably inspired by Colman's example The other reason of the play's popularity might consist in the growing attention of the theatrical audience to the family matters, which, being aptly treated in the second plot line, attracted dramatists of different trends - from Rococo to Sentimentalism. The transformation of Tom Jones's plot and characters in The Jealous Wife, conditioned by their accommodation to the genre canon of the English comedy of manners, was complemented in the French translations and adaptations of the play (written by M.-J. Riccoboni and P. J.-B. Desforges) by some new shifts caused by domestic scenic and cultural norms and by the sentimentalization of motifs and images, accompanying the transition from the grotesque "humour" comedy to the reduced comic effect of sentimentalist "serious" comedy, or drama.

TI A Comparative Modeling Study of Supertyphoons Mangkhut and Yutu (2018)
   Past the Philippines with Ocean-Coupled HWRF
SO ATMOSPHERE
AB The ocean-coupled Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting (HWRF) system was used to investigate the evolution of Supertyphoons Mangkhut and Yutu (2018) over the Philippines Sea and near landfall in the northern Philippines. The simulation results indicate that Mangkhut at a deepening stage has a smaller track sensitivity to the use of different physics schemes but greater intensity sensitivity, which becomes reversed for Yutu at a weakening stage. When both upstream tracks are well simulated with some specific suite of physics schemes, sensitivity experiments indicate that both track deviations near the northern Philippines are only weakly modified by the air-sea interaction (ocean-coupled or uncoupled processes), the topographic effects of the Philippines terrain (retained or not), and the initial ocean temperature change along both typhoon tracks. The interactions between the internal typhoon vortex and the large-scale flow play an important role in the overall movement of both typhoons, which were explored for their structural and convective evolutions near the terrain. The wavenumber-one potential vorticity (PV) tendency budget of the typhoon vortex was analyzed to explain the induced typhoon translation from different physical processes. The west-northwestward translation for the stronger Mangkhut near the northern Philippines is primarily induced by both horizontal and vertical PV advection but with the latter further enhanced to dominate the northward deflection when closing in to the terrain. However, the northwestward translation and track deflection near landfall for the weaker Yutu are driven by the dominant horizontal PV advection. Differential diabatic heating is relatively less important for affecting the movement of both typhoons near landfall.

TI OASL1 Traps Viral RNAs in Stress Granules to Promote Antiviral Responses
SO MOLECULES AND CELLS
AB Oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) protein family is the major interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes responsible for the activation of RNase L pathway upon viral infection. OAS-like (OASL) is also required for inhibition of viral growth in human cells, but the loss of one of its mouse homolog, OASL1, causes a severe defect in termination of type I interferon production. To further investigate the antiviral activity of OASL1, we examined its subcellular localization and regulatory roles in IFN production in the early and late stages of viral infection. We found OASL1, but not OASL2, formed stress granules trapping viral RNAs and promoted efficient RLR signaling in early stages of infection. Stress granule formation was dependent on RNA binding activity of OASL1. But in the late stages of infection, OASL1 interacted with IRF7 transcripts to inhibit translation resulting in down regulation of IFN production. These results implicate that OASL1 plays context dependent functions in the antiviral response for the clearance and resolution of viral infections.

TI Honks, Whistles, and Harp: The Transnational Sound of Harpo Marx
SO MIRANDA
AB This article investigates the role music and sound played in Harpo Marx's singular ability to traverse complex, controversial social and political boundaries-an ability that influenced Harpo's selection as the first American to perform in the USSR after its formal recognition by the USA. The Marx Brothers burst into cinema during Hollywood's transition from silent films to talkies-a transition essential to the effective translation of Harpo's character from stage to screen. Although Harpo never spoke in his movies, he was anything but silent. His character was a creature of sound, dependent on an emotive level of communication accessible to all with little need for translation-emotions he expressed in honks, whistles and, most eloquently, in his music. This allowed Harpo to transcend class and wartime politics; a freedom not afforded his brothers, or any character explicitly tied to verbal language and, by extension, a specific cultural outlook.

TI miR-186 Inhibits Muscle Cell Differentiation through Myogenin Regulation
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB The complex process of skeletal muscle differentiation is organized by the myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs), Myf5, MyoD, Myf6, and myogenin, where myogenin plays a critical role in the regulation of the final stage of muscle differentiation. In an effort to investigate the role microRNAs (miRNAs) play in regulating myogenin, a bioinformatics approach was used and six miRNAs (miR-182, miR-186, miR-135, miR-491, miR-329, and miR-96) were predicted to bind the myogenin 3-untranslated region (UTR). However, luciferase assays showed only miR-186 inhibited translation and 3-UTR mutagenesis analysis confirmed this interaction was specific. Interestingly, the expression of miR-186 mirrored that of its host gene, ZRANB2, during development. Functional studies demonstrated that miR-186 overexpression inhibited the differentiation of C2C12 and primary muscle cells. Our findings therefore identify miR-186 as a novel regulator of myogenic differentiation.

TI THE ARMENIAN VERSION OF PS.-HIPPOLYTUS DE CONSUMMATIONE MUNDI AND ITS
   IMPACT ON THE ARMENIAN APOCALYPTIC TRADITION
SO MUSEON
AB This article presents for the first time the Armenian version of an eschatological composition known as Ps.-Hippolytus De Consummatione Mundi (BHG 812z, CPG 1910) in comparison with its Greek original, and evaluates its possible impact on other Armenian apocalyptic texts, particularly Agarangel On the end of the world. It first discusses briefly the textual tradition of the Armenian Ps.-Hippolytus and reveals that it is extant in at least two recensions. Their distinctive features are exposed. Then, the article explores some common themes, the so-called 'eschatologically sensitive formulae', that Ps.-Hippolytus and Agarangel On the end of the world sham, emphasising both text's engagement in anti-Jewish polemic. Such topoi, particularly in relation to the function of the Jews in the eschatological drama and their fate during the Last Judgement, are significant given that they are attested only in very few other texts. This could lead to the hypothesis of a direct dependence between these two texts. However, a more detailed comparison provides grounds to refuse this possibility. Nevertheless, a shared cultural-geographical milieu of the two texts' redaction may be hypothesised and a possible relative and absolute dating proposed, suggesting a date of the composition of Agarangel On the end of the world at the time of Emperor Heraclius and the so-called last great conflict of Late Antiquity - Byzantine-Persian wars.

TI A step-by-step microRNA guide to cancer development and metastasis
SO CELLULAR ONCOLOGY
AB Background Cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality. The neoplastic transformation of normal cells to cancer cells is caused by a progressive accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations in oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes and epigenetic regulators, providing cells with new properties, collectively known as the hallmarks of cancer. During the process of neoplastic transformation cells progressively acquire novel characteristics such as unlimited growth potential, increased motility and the ability to migrate and invade adjacent tissues, the ability to spread from the tumor of origin to distant sites, and increased resistance to various types of stresses, mostly attributed to the activation of genetic stress-response programs. Accumulating evidence indicates a crucial role of microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) in the initiation and progression of cancer, acting either as oncogenes (oncomirs) or as tumor suppressors via several molecular mechanisms. MiRNAs comprise a class of small similar to 22 bp long noncoding RNAs that play a key role in the regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, acting as negative regulators of mRNA translation and/or stability. MiRNAs are involved in the regulation of a variety of biological processes including cell cycle progression, DNA damage responses and apoptosis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal cell transitions, cell motility and stemness through complex and interactive transcription factor-miRNA regulatory networks.
   Conclusions The impact and the dynamic potential of miRNAs with oncogenic or tumor suppressor properties in each stage of the multistep process of tumorigenesis, and in the adaptation of cancer cells to stress, are discussed. We propose that the balance between oncogenic versus tumor suppressive miRNAs acting within transcription factor-miRNA regulatory networks, influences both the multistage process of neoplastic transformation, whereby normal cells become cancerous, and their stress responses. The role of specific tumor-derived exosomes containing miRNAs and their use as biomarkers in diagnosis and prognosis, and as therapeutic targets, are also discussed.

TI The Origins of the Prose Captions in H.D.'s Helen in Egypt
SO REVIEW OF ENGLISH STUDIES
AB H.D.'s Helen in Egypt, written between 1952 and 1955 and published posthumously in 1961, is a major work of a modernist poet at the height of her powers. Yet critical attention to it has been relatively sparse, most likely due to the puzzling effect created by the dynamic combination of poetry and prose. Conventional readings of this poem have either ignored the prose segments altogether or interpreted them through psychoanalytic, feminist and postmodernist perspectives. But an important letter H.D. wrote to Norman Holmes Pearson on the 3rd of February, 1955 reveals that she decided to include the prose segments after she had visited a nearby recording studio where she had made the spontaneous decision to give brief introductions to the poems. The letter furthermore indicates that she envisioned her own translation of Euripides' Ion to be a model for crafting the prose interludes-and indeed Euripidean drama and its criticism turns out to offer crucial perspectives for understanding how they function. This essay seeks, therefore, to problematize conventional readings of this poem and offer new considerations of its hybrid textuality by situating it within the contexts of Euripidean drama and twentieth century theories of orality. When read in this light, Helen in Egypt reveals itself to be a reflection of its compositional process both structurally and at the level of its narrative, thereby constituting a unique example of a reflexive modernist text that fuses poetry and prose as well as oral and textual consciousness.

TI The tyranny of the tool: surtitling live performances
SO PERSPECTIVES-STUDIES IN TRANSLATION THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB Surtitling is a complementary communication system that renders the verbal utterances taking place on stage into a written format and makes this accessible to members of the audience. Beyond the decisions of the professionals involved in the surtitling process, many of the characteristics related to surtitling content and its format are determined by a number of paralinguistic aspects. In this context, the effectiveness of both the surtitling process and the end result will depend on the following: the facilities for accessible services within the building where live performances take place; the development of technological innovations included in live performances; and the specifications of the surtitling technologies used.
   Central to the study detailed by this paper are the technical aspects related to the existing surtitling systems used in different live performances in scenic art venues. After a short introduction, dealing with the main features of stage performances, such as music, drama, stage, translation and surtitling practice, Section 2 examines the different indoor and outdoor spaces where live performances take place. In Section 3, new live performance spaces are presented. In Section 4, the surtitling practices of stage performances are outlined. In Section 5, commercially available software programmes are analysed, following the specifications for each genre. Section 6 concludes with a reflection on the multiple accessibility solutions that the latest developments in technology could offer to live performances.

TI Stop the Show The Al-Midan theatre scandal and the dynamics of
   delegitimization
SO PERFORMANCE RESEARCH
AB On 17 April 2015, in honour of Palestinian Prisoners' Day, A Parallel Time was performed with Hebrew translation the first time at the Palestinian-Arab Al-Midan Theatre. The play, created by Bashar Murkus, was inspired by the personal story and writings of Walid Daka, a Palestinian citizen of Israel convicted for aiding in the murder of soldier Moshe Tamam. On the night of the performance, niece of the deceased soldier Ortal Tamam led a demonstration against the play, claiming it glorified terrorists. News quickly spread to the press and social media, inciting what ultimately became a 'big scandal'. Using a wide range of sources, this article reconstructs the scandal of A Parallel Time and demonstrates its bipolar dynamic. At one pole is a play produced by a state-supported theatre about the life of 'security prisoners', and at the other are protest performances that embodied bereavement discourse in Israel, the public support they received from politicians and rallies for freedom of expression. The scandal managed to transform a small play by a theatre unknown among Jewish Israelis into a public, multi-player drama. This drama also included bureaucratic and judicial performances that legally validated the 'symbolic crusade' against Palestinian theatre, and exposed the weaknesses of Israeli democracy. This article will propose that this type of big scandal, which culminated in the shutdown of a theatre, is in fact an interruption-and will work to unveil its components and the dynamics of delegitimization that characterized it.

TI Identifying MicroRNAs and Transcript Targets in Jatropha Seeds
SO PLOS ONE
AB MicroRNAs, or miRNAs, are endogenously encoded small RNAs that play a key role in diverse plant biological processes. Jatropha curcas L. has received significant attention as a potential oilseed crop for the production of renewable oil. Here, a sRNA library of mature seeds and three mRNA libraries from three different seed development stages were generated by deep sequencing to identify and characterize the miRNAs and pre-miRNAs of J. curcas. Computational analysis was used for the identification of 180 conserved miRNAs and 41 precursors (pre-miRNAs) as well as 16 novel pre-miRNAs. The predicted miRNA target genes are involved in a broad range of physiological functions, including cellular structure, nuclear function, translation, transport, hormone synthesis, defense, and lipid metabolism. Some pre-miRNA and miRNA targets vary in abundance between the three stages of seed development. A search for sequences that produce siRNA was performed, and the results indicated that J. curcas siRNAs play a role in nuclear functions, transport, catalytic processes and disease resistance. This study presents the first large scale identification of J. curcas miRNAs and their targets in mature seeds based on deep sequencing, and it contributes to a functional understanding of these miRNAs.

AB This article examines the popularity of the most important plays performed in the Amsterdamse Schouwburg between 1650 and 1670 on the basis of the receipts recorded in the archives. This recent research into Dutch theatre history and the Amsterdamse Schouwburg shows that the public enjoyed a repertoire that was much more international and multifaceted than just the classic Biblical tragedies mentioned in the literary histories. From the mid-seventeenth century, it was the translations of Spanish comedias that attracted a large audience. People enjoyed both the spectacle and the important roles for women. This had major consequences for the Schouwburg's staff, because, for the first time, actresses had to be hired. These Dutch actresses were versatile divas with a great sense of drama, and the audience came especially to see them. Further research into this topic is recommended.

TI Literature as laboratory: Hilda Kuper's factional representations of

SO AFRICAN STUDIES
AB Anthropologists have long recognised the intersections between factual and fictional representations of other cultures, and have actively engaged in producing imaginative cultural translations alongside ethnographic accounts. This resulting 'blurring of genres' has also been investigated by anthropologists, but often at the expense of the imagined subject and the social, political, and cultural forces at work in the literary versions. Hilda Kuper's literary expression attests to how an anthropologist can negotiate the boundaries of science and art to produce a literature of protest that acknowledges the larger project of writing back to empire, engages with South African apartheid, and intervenes in the representation of Swaziland by earlier colonial and travel narratives by producing alternative visions that at once affirm and critique custom and tradition. At the same time, her fiction and drama betray the tensions at work in the ethnographic imagination.

This study focused on Tppp2 (tubulin polymerization promoting protein family member 2), whose encoded protein localizes in elongating spermatids at stages IV-VIII of the seminiferous epithelial cycle in testis and in mature sperm in the epididymis. In human and mouse sperm, in vitro inhibition of TPPP2 caused significantly decreased motility and ATP content. Studies on Tppp2 knockout (KO) mice demonstrated that deletion of TPPP2 resulted in male subfertility with a significantly decreased sperm count and motility. In Tppp2(-/-) mice, increased irregular mitochondria lacking lamellar cristae, abnormal expression of electron transfer chain molecules, lower ATP levels, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and increased apoptotic index were observed in sperm, which could be the potential causes for its oligoasthenozoospermia phenotype. Moreover, we identified a potential TPPP2-interactive protein, eEf 1b (eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 beta), which plays an important role in protein translation extension. Thus, TPPP2 is probably a potential pathogenic factor in oligoasthenozoospermia. Deficiency of TPPP2 might affect the translation of specific proteins, altering the structure and function of sperm mitochondria, and resulting in decreased sperm count, motility and fertility.

TI Finding Patria and Pietas in Leeds: Tony Harrison and Virgil's Aeneid
SO ENGLISH STUDIES
AB Since his translation of Aeschylus's Oresteia, produced at the National Theatre in 1981, Tony Harrison has been closely associated with ancient Greek literature, especially that of the dramatic poets. And while his work since the 1980s has often drawn on fifth-century BC Athenian drama, his training as a Classicist is steeped in Latin poetry, particularly that of Virgil. Little has been written, however, about the place of Virgil or Latin poetry more broadly, in Harrison's poetic imagination. This is largely because of the relative paucity of works by Harrison which explicitly engage with Latin poetry. This paper will argue, however, that there is as much to learn from the absence of explicit engagement as there is to learn from the works that do engage with the Latin poetic tradition, particularly when it comes to the influence of Virgil's Aeneid.

TI TRANSLATING A FAVELA MUSICAL: VINICIUS DE MORAES' ORFEU DA CONCEICAO IN
   GERMAN
SO CADERNOS DE TRADUCAO
AB Vinicius de Moraes' musical Orfeu da Conceicao. Tragedia carioca em tres atos (1954) can be considered both a classic of Brazilian literature and world literature. Vinicius links the Greek myth with Afro-Brazilian culture, musical pieces that became bossa nova classics, and stages a black Orpheus on a favela hill in Rio de Janeiro. The play has been picturized several times but has been hardly translated. This article would like to outline a few challenges for a translation into German. First and foremost, strategies need to be developed for conveying Afro-Brazilian culture. Firstly, the semantic field "favela" and the favela slang will be examined, secondly, the translation of the musical pieces and the semantic field "samba". It turns out to be useful to leave terms in the original which refer to a specific Brazilian socio-cultural context, for example the diminutive neguinho/neguinha or samba instruments. Another possibility is the adaptation of a term (morro) in German (favela hill) in order to transport the socio-cultural meaning from the source language to the target language. These strategies help to emphasize a specific Brazilian or Afro-Brazilian character of the piece in translation as well. In this context, the paratext has a culture-mediating function.

SO JUNG JOURNAL-CULTURE & PSYCHE
AB The much-anticipated English translation of Children's Dreams is a welcome addition to the corpus of Jung's published writings. The informal style of Jung's spoken word is preserved as Jung analyzes childhood dreams reported by adults or analysands. Jung's summary of his dream analysis method, which is presented in the first chapter, is a valuable introduction for anyone interested in the dreams of children or adults. Jung's general schema for dreams based on the dramatic structure of the Greek mystery dramas is described. The seminar members, who included Marie-Louise von Franz, Aniela Jaffe, Margaret Sachs, Jolande Jacobi, Hans Baumann, and others, did much to draw Jung out in their attempt to understand analytical psychology, and his exchanges with them bring the seminar to life, almost as if it were happening today.

TI Peculiarities in Activation of Hydrolytic Activity of Elongation Factors
SO BIOCHEMISTRY-MOSCOW
AB Translational GTPases (trGTPases) belong to the family of G proteins and play key roles at all stages of protein biosynthesis on the ribosome. Unidirectional and cyclic functioning of G proteins is ensured by their ability to switch between the active and inactive states due to GTP hydrolysis accelerated by the auxiliary GTPase-activating proteins. Although trGTPases interact with the ribosomes in different conformational states, they bind to the same conserved region, which, unlike in classical GTPase-activating proteins, is represented by ribosomal RNA. The resulting catalytic sites have almost identical structure in all elongation factors suggesting a common mechanism of GTP hydrolysis. However, fine details of the activated state formation and significantly different rates of GTP hydrolysis indicate the existence of distinctive features upon GTP hydrolysis catalyzed by the different factors. Here, we present a contemporary view on the mechanism of GTPase activation and GTP hydrolysis by the elongation factors EF-Tu, EF-G, and SelB based on the analysis of structural, biochemical, and bioinformatics data.

TI How can developmental biology help feed a growing population?
SO DEVELOPMENT
AB Agriculture is challenged globally from a variety of fronts, including a steady increase in world population, changes in climate and a requirement to reduce fertiliser inputs. In the production of crops that are able to overcome these challenges, developmental biology can play a crucial role. The process of domesticating wild progenitors into edible crops is closely linked to modification of developmental processes, and the steps that are needed to face the current challenges will equally require developmental modifications. In this Spotlight, we describe the achievements by developmental biologists in identifying the genes responsible for domestication of some of the most important crops, and highlight that developmental biology is in a unique position to remain centre stage in improving crop performance to meet current and future demands. We propose that the explosive technological advances in sequencing, genome editing and advanced data processing provide an excellent opportunity for researchers to combine scientific disciplines and realise the continued potential of plants as the primary food source for generations to come.

TI The Tragicomic Philosophy of Waiting for Godot
SO MODERN LANGUAGE QUARTERLY
AB Samuel Beckett's interest in tragicomedy has been clear since he attached the subtitle A Tragicomedy in Two Acts to the English translation of Waiting for Godot. This article articulates what exactly Beckettian tragicomedy does. Godot, Beckett's foremost tragicomedy, stages the interplay of his wide-ranging literary and philosophical influences. Drawing on figures such as Arthur Schopenhauer, Jean Racine, Henri Bergson, Arnold Geulincx, and Fritz Mauthner, the play bends toward tragedy but undercuts any sense of finality with its slow unrolling. More than a metaphysical statement, this temporal model of tragicomedy offers a Beckettian ethics insistent on both the resigned compassion of tragedy and comedy's power to critique. In outlining Godot's tragicomic philosophy, the essay charts Beckett's deployment of the various figures who inspire his play but also shows how this tragicomic paradigm functions in the theater-and how it inspires future dramatists.

TI Tales of Detailed Poly(A) Tails
SO TRENDS IN CELL BIOLOGY
AB Poly(A) tails are non-templated additions of adenosines at the 3 ' ends of most eukaryotic mRNAs. In the nucleus, these RNAs are co-transcriptionally cleaved at a poly(A) site and then polyadenylated before being exported to the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, poly(A) tails play pivotal roles in the translation and stability of the mRNA. One challenge in studying poly(A) tails is that they are difficult to sequence and accurately measure. However, recent advances in sequencing technology, computational algorithms, and other assays have enabled a more detailed look at poly(A) tail length genome-wide throughout many developmental stages and organisms. With the help of these advances, our understanding of poly(A) tail length has evolved over the past 5 years with the recognition that highly expressed genes can have short poly(A) tails and the elucidation of the seemingly contradictory roles for poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) in facilitating both protection and deadenylation.

TI Elf3 deficiency during zebrafish development alters extracellular matrix
   organization and disrupts tissue morphogenesis
SO PLOS ONE
AB E26 transformation specific (ETS) family transcription factors are expressed during embryogenesis and are involved in various cellular processes such as proliferation, migration, differentiation, angiogenesis, apoptosis, and survival of cellular lineages to ensure appropriate development. Dysregulated expression of many of the ETS family members is detected in different cancers. The human ELF3, a member of the ETS family of transcription factors, plays a role in the induction and progression of human cancers is well studied. However, little is known about the role of ELF3 in early development. Here, the zebrafish elf3 was cloned, and its expression was analyzed during zebrafish development. Zebrafish elf3 is maternally deposited. At different developmental stages, elf3 expression was detected in different tissue, mainly neural tissues, endoderm-derived tissues, cartilage, heart, pronephric duct, blood vessels, and notochord. The expression levels were high at the tissue boundaries. Elf3 loss-of-function consequences were examined by using translation blocking antisense morpholino oligonucleotides, and effects were validated using CRISPR/Cas9 knockdown. Elf3-knockdown produced short and bent larvae with notochord, craniofacial cartilage, and fin defects. The extracellular matrix (ECM) in the fin and notochord was disorganized. Neural defects were also observed. Optic nerve fasciculation (bundling) and arborization in the optic tectum were defective in Elf3-morphants, and fragmentation of spinal motor neurons were evident. Dysregulation of genes encoding ECM proteins and matrix metalloprotease (MMP) and disorganization of ECM may play a role in the observed defects in Elf3 morphants. We conclude that zebrafish Elf3 is required for epidermal, mesenchymal, and neural tissue development.

TI AGAIN ABOUT "MY KINGDOM FOR A HORSE": THE WAY OF INTERPRETATION OF
   "RICHARD III"
SO STUDIA LITTERARUM
AB The article reveals a new way of interpreting the last words of Shakespeare's Richard III on the Bosworth battlefield (5.4.7, 13). As evidenced by numerous parodies and anecdotes the phrase became an idiom in the age of Shakespeare, and in the 19th century Russian translations has survived metamorphoses ranging from the fairy "half the kingdom" to the alternative "the whole kingdom" for a horse. The available interpretations in scientific editions don't clarify the expression. It is absent in historical (Hall, Holinshed) and possible literary (Richardus Tertius, True Tragedy) sources, but corresponds to the logic of character and actions of Shakespeare's Richard. We traced the development of the "white horse" motive, identified its heraldic symbolism and the leading biblical allegory associated with the image of the victor in the battle for the world (Rev. 19: 11, 16), as well as the playwright's emphasis on the tyrant's progressing madness. The revealed increase in biblical lexis ("irons of wrath," "cast," etc) and imagery (non-sunrise, the paradox of "George" and "dragon"), the symbolism of the stage space (set in accordance with the iconography of the Crucifixion and the Last Judgment) allow us to read the denouement of the cross-cutting theme of the fight between "the world" and "nothing" (1.2.240) in spirit and tradition of religious play. Richard's "wager" takes the play beyond the boundaries of the genres codified by the Folio (Histories and Tragedies) and raises it to a mystery play, demonstrating the last battle in Heaven. Paradoxically, the first Russian translator of the play, S. Sergievsky, at the end of the 18th century most accurately succeeded in conveying the meaning of the "bet," following the French translation by Pierre Antoine de La Place.

TI Cultural continuity and national emasculation: Werner Herzog's and
   Dariush Mehrjui's cinematic adaptations of Georg Buchner's Woyzeck
SO JOURNAL OF ADAPTATION IN FILM & PERFORMANCE
AB Taking the example of German dramatist Georg Buchner's play Woyzeck, this article presents several arguments to differentiate an influential discourse on film adaptations: the discourse of fidelity - the idea that adaptations are evaluated by their close translation of an original work of literature to the cinematic screen. After having criticized this discourse in terms of the textual and editorial status of Buchner's drama, the article provides a comparative case study contrasting two adaptations of Georg Buchner's Woyzeck to differentiate the issue: Werner Herzog's approach Woyzeck (1979) and Dariush Mehrjui's transcultural adaptation Postchi (Postman) (1972). While Herzog's film is often considered a faithful adaption, it not only provides interesting transformations of Buchner's drama but, as will be argued, Herzog chose his specific, theatricalized approach to make the film relevant to German audiences of the 1970s by recreating a lost connection to Germany's cultural heritage. The supposed faithfulness of his adaptation has to be considered in this specific context. Mehrjui's transcultural adaptation, in contrast, transposes Buchner's Woyzeck to an Iranian context, making it relevant for specific historical and societal issues in Iran in the 1970s. Buchner's Woyzeck, in which the theme of the eponymous character's impotence plays an important role, becomes an allegorical story of national emasculation in Mehrjui's adaptation. As different as Herzog's and Mehrjui's cinematic approaches and intentions may be - creating national cultural continuity versus creating a story of national emasculation - they both develop highly creative adaptations of Buchner's Woyzeck.

TI CMMCSegNet: Cross-Modality Multicascade Indirect LGE Segmentation on
   Multimodal Cardiac MR
SO COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE
AB Since Late-Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) visualizes myocardial infarction, and the balanced-Steady State Free Precession (bSSFP) cine sequence can capture cardiac motions and present clear boundaries; multimodal CMR segmentation has played an important role in the assessment of myocardial viability and clinical diagnosis, while automatic and accurate CMR segmentation still remains challenging due to a very small amount of labeled LGE data and the relatively low contrasts of LGE. The main purpose of our work is to learn the real/fake bSSFP modality with ground truths to indirectly segment the LGE modality of cardiac MR by using a proposed cross-modality multicascade framework: cross-modality translation network and automatic segmentation network, respectively. In the segmentation stage, a novel multicascade pix2pix network is designed to segment the fake bSSFP sequence obtained from a cross-modality translation network. Moreover, we propose perceptual loss measuring features between ground truth and prediction, which are extracted from the pretrained vgg network in the segmentation stage. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on the multimodal CMR dataset and verify its superiority over other state-of-the-art approaches under different network structures and different types of adversarial losses in terms of dice accuracy in testing. Therefore, the proposed network is promising for Indirect Cardiac LGE Segmentation in clinical applications.

TI Effect of PAIP1 on the metastatic potential and prognostic significance
   in oral squamous cell carcinoma
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORAL SCIENCE
AB Poly Adenylate Binding Protein Interacting protein 1 (PAIP1) plays a critical role in translation initiation and is associated with the several cancer types. However, its function and clinical significance have not yet been described in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and its associated features like lymph node metastasis (LNM). Here, we used the data available from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) to analyze PAIP1 expression in oral cancer. The publicly available data suggests that PAIP1 mRNA and protein levels were increased in OSCC. The high PAIP1 expression was more evident in samples with advanced stage, LNM, and worse pattern of invasion. Moreover, the in vitro experiments revealed that PAIP1 knockdown attenuated colony forming, the aggressiveness of OSCC cell lines, decreasing MMP9 activity and SRC phosphorylation. Importantly, we found a correlation between PAIP1 and pSRC through the analysis of the IHC scores and CPTAC data in patient samples. Our findings suggest that PAIP1 could be an independent prognostic factor in OSCC with LNM and a suitable therapeutic target to improve OSCC patient outcomes.

TI Overview of m(6)A and circRNAs in human cancers
SO JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
AB N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A), the richest post-transcriptional modification of RNA in eukaryotic cells, is dynamically installed/uninstalled by the RNA methylase complex ("writer") and demethylase ("eraser") and recognized by the m(6)A-binding protein ("reader"). M(6)A modification on RNA metabolism involves maturation, nuclear export, translation and splicing, thereby playing a critical role in cellular pathophysiology and disease processes. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs with a covalently closed loop structure. Due to its conserved and stable properties, circRNAs could participate in physiological and pathological processes through unique pathways. Despite the recent discovery of m(6)A and circRNAs remains in the initial stage, research has shown that m(6)A modifications are widespread in circRNAs and regulates circRNA metabolism, including biogenesis, cell localization, translation, and degradation. In this review, we describe the functional crosstalk between m(6)A and circRNAs, and illustrate their roles in cancer development. Moreover, we discuss the potential mechanisms and future research directions of m(6)A modification and circRNAs.

TI Ca2+ Regulates ERp57-Calnexin Complex Formation
SO MOLECULES
AB ERp57, a member of the protein disulfide isomerase family, is a ubiquitous disulfide catalyst that functions in the oxidative folding of various clients in the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In concert with ER lectin-like chaperones calnexin and calreticulin (CNX/CRT), ERp57 functions in virtually all folding stages from co-translation to post-translation, and thus plays a critical role in maintaining protein homeostasis, with direct implication for pathology. Here, we present mechanisms by which Ca2+ regulates the formation of the ERp57-calnexin complex. Biochemical and isothermal titration calorimetry analyses revealed that ERp57 strongly interacts with CNX via a non-covalent bond in the absence of Ca2+. The ERp57-CNX complex not only promoted the oxidative folding of human leukocyte antigen heavy chains, but also inhibited client aggregation. These results suggest that this complex performs both enzymatic and chaperoning functions under abnormal physiological conditions, such as Ca2+ depletion, to effectively guide proper oxidative protein folding. The findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms underpinning crosstalk between the chaperone network and Ca2+.

TI Evaluating the Quality of Engineering Translator Training Based on the
   DEA Model
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
AB This paper adopts the DEA model to conduct in-depth research and analysis on the evaluation of the quality training of engineering English translation talents. The BIM application performance of nine engineering projects is empirically analyzed, including slack value analysis, correlation validity analysis, and BIM application performance path optimization. The nine cases have an unreasonable allocation of resources invested in BIM application in the early stage so that the performance path optimization is carried out to find out the key paths for the reallocation of resources. Further analysis of BIM application performance improvement strategies, including strengthening the training of BIM application professionals. The fuzzy two-stage DEA model with adjustable fuzzy opportunity constraint constructed for the situation where both intermediate and final processes have non-desired outputs. First, the additive efficiency decomposition model in the exact number environment is extended to the non-desired output situation. Second, the generalized fuzzy measure and opportunity constraint planning are applied to further extend the model to a non-expected output fuzzy DEA model, and a two-stage DEA model with adjustable fuzzy opportunity constraints is constructed. There are still some differences between the two. Strengthening practice is the general trend of current curriculum reform in our country. Finally, the proposed model is applied to the evaluation problem of quality training of engineering English translators. The adjustable fuzzy opportunity-constrained DEA model proposed in this paper can effectively evaluate the efficiency of real production and operation activities. The research results of this paper not only enrich the existing DEA model theoretical system but also have broad application prospects and values in practical problems. We provide a reasonable guarantee in terms of system and funding and pay attention to the follow-up communication with employers to strengthen the implementation of the influence of social forces on the quality evaluation of English teaching in higher education. To a certain extent, this study enriches the theoretical research on the quality evaluation of English translation talents' quality training and can play a role in strengthening and improving the quality evaluation of translation talents' quality training at the present stage.

TI Senecavirus A Enhances Its Adaptive Evolution via Synonymous Codon Bias
   Evolution
SO VIRUSES-BASEL
AB Synonymous codon bias in the viral genome affects protein translation and gene expression, suggesting that the synonymous codon mutant plays an essential role in influencing virulence and evolution. However, how the recessive mutant form contributes to virus evolvability remains elusive. In this paper, we characterize how the Senecavirus A (SVA), a picornavirus, utilizes synonymous codon mutations to influence its evolution, resulting in the adaptive evolution of the virus to adverse environments. The phylogenetic tree and Median-joining (MJ)-Network of these SVA lineages worldwide were constructed to reveal SVA three-stage genetic development clusters. Furthermore, we analyzed the codon bias of the SVA genome of selected strains and found that SVA could increase the GC content of the third base of some amino acid synonymous codons to enhance the viral RNA adaptive evolution. Our results highlight the impact of recessive mutation of virus codon bias on the evolution of the SVA and uncover a previously underappreciated evolutionary strategy for SVA. They also underline the importance of understanding the genetic evolution of SVA and how SVA adapts to the adverse effects of external stress.

TI miR-1273g-3p modulates activation and apoptosis of hepatic stellate
   cells by directly targeting PTEN in HCV-related liver fibrosis
SO FEBS LETTERS
AB MicroRNA (miRNA) play a pivotal role in the development of liver fibrosis. However, the functions of miRNA in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver fibrosis remain unclear. In this study, we systematically analyzed the microarray data of the serum miRNA in patients with HCV-induced hepatic fibrosis. Among 41 dysregulated miRNA, miR-1273g-3p was the most significantly upregulated miRNA and correlated with the stage of liver fibrosis. Overexpression of miR-1273g-3p could inhibit translation of PTEN, increase the expression of -SMA, Col1A1, and reduce apoptosis in HSCs. Hence, we conclude that miR-1273g-3p might affect the activation and apoptosis of HSCs by directly targeting PTEN in HCV-related liver fibrosis.

TI Chronicles of Dolos and Apate in Plant microRNAs
SO BIOLOGIA
AB Not all transcribed eukaryotic RNAs are precisely protein-coding, some seem to be non-functional and are the results of spurious transcription, while many others play pivotal roles in specific regulation of gene expression and direct translation. The regulation in the shape of gene silencing occurs at two stages of transcriptional and post-transcriptional. In transcriptional layer, either an RNA-directed DNA methylation and/or chromatin remodeling can be modulated by non-protein coding RNAs in the nucleus. In post-transcriptional regulation, sequence-specific regulation of complementary target mRNAs is remaining the principal cause. miRNA-mediated gene regulation machinery that triggers the regular transcription of mRNAs is evolutionarily ancient and is the topic of this review.

TI Can Patrolling Liver-Resident T Cells Control Human Malaria Parasite
   Development?
SO TRENDS IN IMMUNOLOGY
AB Recently, a population of non-recirculating, tissue-resident memory CD8(+) T cells has been identified; cells that seems to act as key sentinels for invading microorganisms with enhanced effector functions. In malaria, the liver represents the first site for parasite development before a definite infection is established in circulating red blood cells. Here, we discuss the evidence obtained from animal models on several diseases and hypothesize that liver-resident memory CD8(+) T cells (hepatic T-RM) play a critical role in providing protective liver-stage immunity against Plasmodium malaria parasites. Although observations in human malaria trials are limited to peripheral blood, we propose recommendations for the translation of some of these findings to human malaria research.

TI Resistance to Rhabdoviridae Infection and Subversion of Antiviral
   Responses
SO VIRUSES-BASEL
AB Interferon (IFN) treatment induces the expression of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). However, only a selection of their products have been demonstrated to be responsible for the inhibition of rhabdovirus replication in cultured cells; and only a few have been shown to play a role in mediating the antiviral response in vivo using gene knockout mouse models. IFNs inhibit rhabdovirus replication at different stages via the induction of a variety of ISGs. This review will discuss how individual ISG products confer resistance to rhabdoviruses by blocking viral entry, degrading single stranded viral RNA, inhibiting viral translation or preventing release of virions from the cell. Furthermore, this review will highlight how these viruses counteract the host IFN system.

TI Representation of Body Orientation in Vestibular-Defective Patients
   Before and After Unilateral Vestibular Loss
SO FRONTIERS IN SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE
AB Introduction: The unilateral vestibular syndrome results in postural, oculomotor, perceptive, and cognitive symptoms. This study was designed to investigate the role of vestibular signals in body orientation representation, which remains poorly considered in vestibular patients.
   Methods: The subjective straight ahead (SSA) was investigated using a method disentangling translation and rotation components of error. Participants were required to align a rod with their body midline in the horizontal plane. Patients with right vestibular neurotomy (RVN; n =8) or left vestibular neurotomy (LVN; n = 13) or vestibular schwannoma resection were compared with 12 healthy controls. Patients were tested the day before surgery and during the recovery period, 7 days and 2 months after the surgery.
   Results: Before and after unilateral vestibular neurotomy, i.e., in the chronic phases, patients showed a rightward translation bias of their SSA, without rotation bias, whatever the side of the vestibular loss. However, the data show that the lower the translation error before neurotomy, the greater its increase 2 months after a total unilateral vestibular loss, therefore leading to a rightward translation of similar amplitude in the two groups of patients. In the early phase after surgery, SSA moved toward the operated side both in translation and in rotation, as typically found for biases occurring after unilateral vestibular loss, such as the subjective visual vertical (SVV) bias.
   Discussion and Conclusion: This study gives the first description of the immediate consequences and of the recovery time course of body orientation representation after a complete unilateral vestibular loss. The overall evolution differed according to the side of the lesion with more extensive changes over time before and after left vestibular loss. It is noteworthy that representational disturbances of self-orientation were highly unusual in the chronic stage after vestibular loss and similar to those reported after hemispheric lesions causing spatial neglect, while classical ipsilesional biases were reported in the acute stage. This study strongly supports the notion that the vestibular system plays a major role in body representation processes and more broadly in spatial cognition. From a clinical point of view, SSA appeared to be a reliable indicator for the presence of a vestibular disorder.

TI Sir William Lower at The Hague
SO ENGLISH STUDIES
AB One of the most neglected literary figures among English royalist exile communities is Sir William Lower. Living at The Hague during the last five years of the Interregnum, Lower was close to, and is likely to have held positions at, the courts of both Mary of Orange and Elizabeth of Bohemia. His work in this period, which was published in his adopted home city, therefore represents a rich resource for examining the influence of translation and drama in "writing" the royalist exile, and for assessing the particular features of life and letters in the United Provinces which both chime with and distinguish it from other centres of royalist displacement on the continent. This essay considers, in particular, how Lower's works exhibit a complex partisanship which seeks to combine, inter alia, the cultural elevation derived from the romance genre with the linguistic faithfulness and personal loyalties of the author.

SO SHAW-THE JOURNAL OF BERNARD SHAW STUDIES
AB This article focuses on how Bernard Shaw's plays build bridges to Chinese culture, through looking at the famous Chinese painter Xu Bei Hong's Slave and the Lion (1924) and Shaw's Androcles and the Lion (1912). Xu's oil painting was created in 1924 in Berlin, where Siegfried Trebitsch's translation of Androcles and the Lion had been staged in November 1912. Much of the message Xu invested in the painting reflected ideas young Chinese intellectuals were gathering from Shaw and his plays, especially concerning negotiations between authority and the individual will within the struggle for survival and resistance to oppression. Xu was part of an intricate network making use of Shaw to advocate social reforms and boost Chinese nationalism. The article examines the coexistence of the Western and Chinese perspectives in the painting to show how Xu dexterously made use of the original myth to provide multiple levels of meanings.

TI 'TIS THE TIME'S PLAGUE, WHEN MADMEN LEAD THE BLIND': THE CROWN-VIRUS IN
   KING LEAR
SO COMMUNIO VIATORUM
AB This article is an exploration of the political theological themes in the drama of William Shakespeare, specifically King Lear which seem to be of especial relevance during this time of coronavirus. Two lines of inquiry are pursued: firstly, the mimetic theory of Rene Girard, and secondly the insights of political theologians of the early modern period, taking their lead from Ernst Kantorowicz's The King's Two Bodies (1957). Girard's approach is fruitful, given his interest in Shakespeare, and given his view of plague as both metaphor and palimpsest for social conflict. Kantorowitz and others have used Shakepearean tragedy to map the traumatic "translation of sovereignty" in the early modern period. Applying these two lines of investigation to the coronavirus crisis sheds light on a challenge which, far from being purely scientific or epidemiological, is fraught with unfinished business from the theological past; what Eric Santner calls the "royal remains."

TI Tail characteristics of Trypanosoma brucei mitochondrial transcripts are
   developmentally altered in a transcript-specific manner
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY
AB The intricate life cycle of Trypanosoma brucei requires extensive regulation of gene expression levels of the mtRNAs for adaptation. Post-transcriptional gene regulatory programs, including unencoded mtRNA 3' tail additions, potentially play major roles in this adaptation process. Intriguingly, T. brucei mitochondria] transcripts possess two distinct unencoded 3' tails, each with a differing functional role; i.e., while one type is implicated in RNA stability (in-tails), the other type appears associated with translation (ex-tails). We examined the degree to which tail characteristics differ among cytochrome c oxidase subunits I and III (C01 and CO3), and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (NDI) transcripts, and to what extent these characteristics differ developmentally. We found that CO1, CO3 and ND1 transcripts possess longer in-tails in the mammalian life stage. By mathematically modelling states of in-tail and ex-tail addition, we determined that the typical length at which an in-tail is extended to become an ex-tail differs by transcript and, in the case of ND1, by life stage. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first evidence that developmental differences exist in tail length distributions of mtRNAs, underscoring the potential involvement of in-tail and ex-tail populations in mitochondrial post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms.

TI Biomaterial-induced macrophage polarization for bone regeneration
SO CHINESE CHEMICAL LETTERS
AB As the main target cells of immune regulation, macrophages play an important role in the bone regen-eration process. Macrophages can be polarized into the M1 and M2 types under the stimulation of dif-ferent factors. They have proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects, respectively, and play key roles in different stages of bone regeneration. The ratio of M1 to M2 macrophages can be regulated by im-munomodulatory biomaterials to promote bone repair and regeneration. In this paper, we review the recent literature on the chemical, physical and biological properties of biomaterials and the regulation of macrophage polarization under the influence of other factors. We also cover new methods for preparing immunomodulatory biomaterials for bone regeneration. This paper will provide new design ideas for the development of biomaterials with immunological properties and will support the clinical translation of bone-related medical biomaterials.

SO FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB Eukaryotic messenger mRNAs contain many RNA methyl chemical modifications, in which N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) plays a very important role. The modification process of RNA methylation is a dynamic reversible regulatory process that is mainly catalyzed by "Writer" m(6)A methyltransferase, removed by "Eraser" m(6)A demethylase, and recognized by the m(6)A binding protein, thereby, linking m(6)A modification with other mRNA pathways. At various stages of the life cycle, m(6)A modification plays an extremely important role in regulating mRNA splicing, processing, translation, as well as degradation, and is associated with gametogenesis and fertility for both sexes. Normal gametogenesis is a basic guarantee of fertility. Infertility leads to trauma, affects harmony in the family and seriously affects the quality of life. We review the roles and mechanisms of RNA m(6)A methylation modification in infertility and provide a potential target for infertility treatment, which can be used for drug development.

SO HUMAN REPRODUCTION UPDATE
AB Infertility affects similar to 7% of couples of reproductive age with little change in incidence in the last two decades. ART, as well as other interventions, have made major strides in correcting this condition. However, and in spite of advancements in the field, the age of the female partner remains a main factor for a successful outcome. A better understanding of the final stages of gamete maturation yielding an egg that can sustain embryo development and a pregnancy to term remains a major area for improvement in the field. This review will summarize the major cellular and molecular events unfolding at the oocyte-to-embryo transition. We will provide an update on the most important processes/pathways currently understood as the basis of developmental competence, including the molecular processes involved in mRNA storage, its recruitment to the translational machinery, and its degradation. We will discuss the hypothesis that the translational programme of maternal mRNAs plays a key role in establishing developmental competence. These regulations are essential to assemble the machinery that is used to establish a totipotent zygote. This hypothesis further supports the view that embryogenesis begins during oogenesis. A better understanding of the events required for developmental competence will guide the development of novel strategies to monitor and improve the success rate of IVF. Using this information, it will be possible to develop new biomarkers that may be used to better predict oocyte quality and in selection of the best egg for IVF.

TI Immersion positively effects learning in virtual reality games compared
   to equally interactive 2d games
SO INFORMATION AND LEARNING SCIENCES
AB Purpose - This study isolates the effect of immersion on players' learning in a virtual reality (VR)-based game about cellular biology by comparing two versions of the game with the same level of interactivityand different levels of immersion. The authors identify immersion and additional interactivity as two key affordances of VR as a learning tool. A number of research studies compare VR with two-dimensional or minimally interactive media; this study focuses on the effect of immersion as a result of the head mounted display (HMD).
   Design/methodology/approach - In the game, players diagnose a cell by exploring a virtual cell and search for clues that indicate one of five possible types of cystic fibrosis. Fifty-one adults completed all aspects of the study. Players took pre and post assessments and drew pictures of cells and translation before and after the game. Players were randomly assigned to play the game with the HMD (stereoscopic view) or without the headset (non-stereoscopic view). Players were interviewed about their drawings and experiences at the end of the session.
   Findings - Players in both groups improved in their knowledge of the cell environment and the process of translation. Players who experienced the immersive stereoscopic view had a more positive learning effect in the content assessment, and stronger improvement in their mental models of the process of translation between pre- and post-drawings compared to players who played the two-dimensional game.
   Originality/value - This study suggests that immersion alone has a positive effect on conceptual understanding, especially in helping learners understand spatial environments and processes. These findings set the stage for a new wave of research on learning in immersive environments; research that moves beyond determining whether immersive media correlate with more learning, toward a focus on the types of learning outcomes that are best supported by immersive media.

TI De novo transcriptome and proteome analysis of Dictyophora indusiata
   fruiting bodies provides insights into the changes during morphological
   development
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES
AB De novo transcriptome assembly and shotgun proteome analysis of Dictyophora indusiata fruiting bodies were performed. A total of 19,704 unigenes were sequenced, and 4380 proteins were identified. Annotation and functional analysis of the identified proteins were significantly enriched in small molecule synthetic and metabolic processes, protein modification regulation (phosphorylation and ubiquitination), and vesicle transport. Furthermore, quantitative developmental transcriptome analysis was performed between the peach-shaped and mature fruiting bodies, and the results revealed that the metabolism and transport activities were upregulated in the mature stage, while protein translation was downregulated; this regulation is likely the main reason for the significant changes in the nutrients of fruiting bodies. Furthermore, the cell wall stress-dependent MAPK sub-pathway was activated in the mature stage, and fungal cell wall degradation-related genes were upregulated, which could promote reconstruction of the cell wall and might play a key role in the morphological development of D. indusiata fruiting bodies.

TI Searching moderation in alcohol consumption adjusting knowledge to
   practice
SO SALUD MENTAL
AB Alcohol abuse in Mexico has an enormous impact on people's health. This problem has led authorities to undertake actions to combat and reduce both consumption levels and their consequences. The interventions, focusing on handling problem drinkers -people who already show symptoms of dependence and consume more than one drug, including alcohol-, have proved their effectiveness in various scenarios. In the work setting, this problem is no exception and has also been a focus of concern and the implementation of actions to prevent excess alcohol consumption and provide care for persons beginning to display problems.
   However, implementing programs in the workplace has proved complicated. Other countries have found that many programs are not correctly evaluated or simply not evaluated, making it impossible to determine their effectiveness in solving the problems for which they were designed. Moreover, the personnel that implement them are not properly trained, programs are expensive to implement, and conflicts of interest tend to arise.
   In Mexico, low-cost, effective actions have been implemented for this population. However, the time available for undertaking preventive activities is limited, while the length of workers' shifts means that they do not have enough time for these activities.
   One current challenge is the lions lotion of Research as a tool for the development of efficient, simpler, more practical, and safer interventions, without ignoring the discovery of new information regarding health and disease prevention, as well as creating more efficient treatments and improving existing ones. Within this perspective, researchers worked to produce a brief intervention to reduce harmful alcohol consumption among the working population. It is based on the principles of cognitive social theory put forward by Bandura, in which alcohol consumption is regarded as learned behavior, that causes problems and may be replaced by healthy behaviors, provided dependence has not developed. Another of the components included is motivational theory, according to which the effectiveness of a particular form of treatment is related to individuals' motivation to continue it.
   The aim of this article is to describe the process of translation of research, derived from the implementation of cognitive social and motivational theories to adapt an intervention program designed in a comic book format that is easy to read and understand to teach workers with excess alcohol consumption to moderate their consumption.
   Method
   The work was carried out in two stages:
   Phase 1. Adaptation of a brief intervention to a comic book format. A comic was produced using the elements of a brief intervention. In order to ensure that the concepts put forward in the base theory were accessible to the target population, they were subjected to a process of cognitive laboratories following the methodology proposed by Beatty.
   The comic was produced to make the material easier to read and understand. The process began with a scriptwriter who translated the theoretical contents, together with the terms obtained in the cognitive laboratories into a story that would reflect the target population. This version was subjected to an evaluation described in stage 2.
   Phase 2. Evaluation of language, characters, contents, and format of comic.
   Participants: Researchers worked with 49 subjects from various firms and states in Mexico, 59.2% of whom were men, mostly between the ages of 24 and 42, and over half of whom were married (61.2%). Half had only completed high school or less.
   Instrument: The questionnaire contained demographic questions and indicators to evaluate the comic for: format, understanding of contents, characters, language, and perceived usefulness for reducing problem drinking, among other things.
   Procedure: Participants attended a training course during which they were asked to evaluate the comic. Each one was given a printed copy and a questionnaire. The subjects volunteered to participate and were guaranteed the confidentiality of the information they provided.
   Results
   Over 85% said that they were used to reading on a daily to weekly basis. Most of them thought that the illustrations were attractive and felt that the characters reflected the role they played in the story. They did not like the length of the comic or the fact that the drawings were extremely detailed, with too much text. They also disliked the font and the type of language used.
   Nearly 80% thought that the reading material was neither tedious nor dull. Most rated the story good or very good and thought that the title encouraged people to read it and that they would use it if they had drinking problems. They also identified themselves with the characters and the situations described in the comic. What they liked best was the way the topic was dealt with in a comic, the way the problem was highlighted, the type of language used (colloquial), the message given, the goal setting, the way they became involved in the reading, and the link between users and the family environment.
   Finally, the evaluations of the comic showed that some drawings were regarded as aggressive, the children's language did not match their parents', and the order of the dialogues was confusing.
   This moment in the translation of the intervention made it possible to make changes in several aspects included in the final version. The comic was given to a proofreader to correct spelling mistakes while maintaining the colloquial tone.
   Discussion
   This activity resulted in a comic in which the characters guide the workers through a series of strategies to reduce consumption. This complies with the principles of translating research by adapting the concepts derived from social and motivational cognitive theory, which have proved their effectiveness in dealing with addictive behaviors.
   The inclusion of experts from various areas made it possible to adapt knowledge, by incorporating strategies from the latter into a script that included the dialogues and sketched the characters that would form part of the story. The experts continued to participate during the evaluation process until the final version, with the definitive images, and final dialogues and exercises.
   Having the workers targeted by the intervention try out various aspects of the material made it possible to adjust the language, contents and the story told, the characters' performance and appearance and the way the exercises and dialogues were carried out. This also made it possible to see how useful the workers found it in reducing their own consumption or helping the people around them -family, co-workers and friends- to do so. In order to produce this sort of material, it is essential to use colloquial language that will be understood by the target population, which is the most delicate stage of the process since it involves the correct use of technical assumptions, since otherwise, one would work from a totally different perspective.
   This material can reach men of productive age, who are those that make less use of health services, meaning that it is a tool that covers this inaccessible sector of the population. However, the workers were also given the possibility of seeking help from specialists if they failed to achieve their objectives, in which case the comic achieves the objective of raising awareness.
   Lastly, one of the limitations of the material concerns the fact that the subject himself has to follow up his own progress, meaning that the adaptation must be carried out as rigorously as possible. It also implies that the material must be evaluated through an analysis of the changes that take place in workers as a result of using it.
   The next stage will therefore be to test the intervention through the comic in a controlled test and to evaluate its efficiency in reducing alcohol abuse problems, as well as the subject's possible progression to severe dependence.

TI Shakespeare in La Mancha: Performing Shakespeare at the Almagro Corral
SO SEDERI-YEARBOOK OF THE SPANISH AND PORTUGUESE SOCIETY FOR ENGLISH
   RENAISSANCE STUDIES
AB Shakespeare is one of the most often performed playwrights at the Festival de Teatro Clasico de Almagro [The Almagro Festival of Classical Theater], an event initially created to celebrate Golden Age drama in which, nowadays, Shakespearean productions often outnumber those by individual national authors. Throughout the history of the festival, several Shakespearean productions have been staged in the Corral de Comedias, an original seventeenth-century venue that reactivates the use of space encoded in the playtext due to its similarities with Renaissance playhouses. This article has a double purpose: first, to examine the abundance of Shakespeare in Almagro as a phenomenon that finds its explanation in factors ranging from Shakespeare's popularity to the role of modern translation and, second, to focus on how Shakespearean productions at the Corral de Comedias have negotiated new meanings of Shakespeare in performance, generating an interplay between Renaissance and Golden Age venues in contemporary performance.

TI Using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to design
   and implement a perinatal education program in a large maternity
   hospital
SO BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB Background Implementation science aims to embed evidence-based practice as 'usual care' using theoretical underpinnings to guide these processes. Conceptualising the complementary purpose and application of theoretical approaches through all stages of an implementation project is not well understood and is not routinely reported in implementation research, despite call for this. This paper presents the synthesis and a collective approach to application of a co-design model, a model for understanding need, theories of behaviour change with frameworks and tools to guide implementation and evaluation brought together with the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Method Using a determinant framework such as the CFIR provides a lens for understanding, influencing, and explaining the complex and multidimensional variables at play within a health service that contribute to planning for and delivering effective patient care. Complementary theories, models, frameworks, and tools support the research process by providing a theoretical and practical structure to understanding the local context and guiding successful local implementation. Results This paper provides a rationale for conceptualising the multidimensional approach for implementation using the worked example of a pregnancy, birth, postnatal and early parenting education intervention for expectant and new parents at a large maternity hospital. Conclusion This multidimensional theoretical approach provides useful, practical guidance to health service researchers and clinicians to develop project specific rationale for their theoretical approach to implementation projects.

TI Beyond Disruption: The Life Cycle of Pioneer Communities and Their Role
   in the Rise of a "Digital Society"
SO KOLNER ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SOZIOLOGIE UND SOZIALPSYCHOLOGIE
AB In journalistic discourse, the move toward a "digital society" is often condensed into the concepts and operations of disruptive change, with burgeoning start-ups maneuvering at its epicenter. This article rejects truncated accounts of media and technological change by harnessing the story of the role played by pioneer communities in the process of society's increasingly deep mediatization. Media-related pioneer communities, such as the Quantified Self, Maker, and Hacks/Hackers movements, are characterized by their experimental practices and their imaginaries of society's malleability through media technologies. This article discusses the life cycle of pioneer communities, starting with their formation, when they emerged from the context of social movements and technology-related communities, through their peak phase, whereupon they emerged as start-ups (with their subsequent cultural by-products) and began to receive media attention, to their gradual demise, a stage in their development that is often accompanied by "becoming everyday" as their experimentation melts into quotidian practices. It is argued that the role pioneer communities play in the processes of deep mediatization is their ability to structure horizons by sounding out the possibility of change and by catalyzing translation processes, which means, on the one hand, the translation of ideas between different social domains and, on the other, the transmission of the purely experimental. Through this life cycle, pioneer communities are fundamental, collective actors in society's deeply mediatized rearticulation.

TI Shakespeare's Hamlet/Hamlet, Shakespeare 3.0, and Tugged Hamlet, The
   Comic Prince of The Polish Cabaret POTEM
SO MULTICULTURAL SHAKESPEARE-TRANSLATION APPROPRIATION AND PERFORMANCE
AB Shakespeare's dramas are potentialities. Any Hamlet may be understood as the space in which Shakespeare's thoughts are remembered, as a reproduced copy of the unspecified, unidentified source, the so called original. Simultaneously, it may be conceived of as the space where Shakespeare's legacy and authority is tested, trifled and transgressed. Nowadays Shakespeare's dramas are disseminated in multifarious forms such as: printed materials, audio and video recordings, compact audio discs, digital videos and disc recordings. Since I am fond of the cultural phenomenon called Hamlet, not a singe text or performance, but a continuum of human interaction with intermediated and transcoded versions of the drama, in this article I focus on the abovementioned single play. I accentuate the title character's profound meaning in Shakespeare studies and his iconic status in Western culture in different media. I exploit W.B. Worthen's concept of "Shakespeare 3.0." to demonstrate Shakespeare's presence in digital reality on the example of a comic rendering of Hamlet (Tugged Hamlet, 1992) by the Polish cabaret POTEM. Their cabaret sketch, although it was not created for the Internet audience, is available on-line via YouTube, consituting "Shakespeare 3.0." Furthermore, I pose several questions and attempt to answer them in the course of my analysis: to what extent does the image of a mournful and contemplative Hamlet pervade different dimensions of culture, especially our collective imagination?; what chances of realization has a cultural fantasy of challenging the myth of a witty and contemplative Hamlet when re-written and presented as a pastiche or satire?; was the Polish cabaret POTEM succesful in their comic performance?

TI Wispy and Orb cooperate in the cytoplasmic polyadenylation of localized
   gurken mRNA
SO DEVELOPMENTAL DYNAMICS
AB In Drosophila, the dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis of the oocyte is dependent on Gurken (Grk) protein distribution. This is achieved through the cytoplasmic localization of grk mRNA and regulation of its translation. During mid-late stages of oogenesis, grk mRNA and protein are localized to the dorsal-anterior of the oocyte, while unlocalized grk transcripts are translationally silenced. As females carrying mutations in the gene encoding the CPEB protein Orb lay ventralized eggs due to insufficient Grk levels, it seemed likely that cytoplasmic polyadenylation of grk transcripts may play a role in their translational regulation. We have found that grk is polyadenylated throughout oogenesis, with poly(A) tails of approximately 30-50 A residues. Hyperadenylated grk transcripts, with poly(A) tails of 50-90 As, are detected in late stage egg chambers, but they fail to accumulate in oocytes deficient in Orb or the poly(A) polymerase Wispy (Wisp). wisp females also lay weakly ventralized eggs, demonstrating that they produce inadequate amounts of Grk. Finally, unlocalized grk transcripts are also not appropriately hyperadenylated. Localized cytoplasmic polyadenylation of grk mRNA by Wisp and Orb is necessary to achieve appropriate Grk protein accumulation in the D/A corner of the oocyte during mid to late oogenesis.

TI The "Little Third": Changing Images of Women Characters Involved in
   Extramarital Affairs on Chinese TV
SO COMMUNICATION CULTURE & CRITIQUE
AB For this study, we analyzed the changing images of women characters involved in extramarital affairs in three Chinese TV dramas-Come and Go (CG; Hubei TV & Guangxi TV, 1998), Dwelling Narrowness (DN; Beijing TV & Dragon TV, 2009), and Nothing but Thirty (NT; Dongfang TV & Tencent Video, 2020). We argue here that shifting gender relationships, evolving political, economic, and technological conditions relating to the media industry, and a transition in the broader social environment have motivated a return to patriarchal moral discourse on Chinese TV. Specifically, in keeping with this discourse, extramarital affairs have come to be presented as immoral, primarily for the women involved-the "little third" of the title, this being the literal translation of the Mandarin term for "mistress." We documented this return to patriarchal moral doctrines that are intended to discipline women and limit the diversity and nuance of culturally accepted forms and expressions of sexual attraction and romance on Chinese TV in case studies of the three programs.

TI Temperature-sensitive albino gene TCD5, encoding a monooxygenase,
   affects chloroplast development at low temperatures
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY
AB Chloroplasts are essential for photosynthesis and play critical roles in plant development. In this study, we characterized the temperature-sensitive chlorophyll-deficient rice mutant tcd5, which develops albino leaves at low temperatures (20 degrees C) and normal green leaves at high temperatures (32 degrees C). The development of chloroplasts and etioplasts is impaired in tcd5 plants at 20 degrees C, and the temperature-sensitive period for the albino phenotype is the P4 stage of leaf development. The development of thylakoid membranes is arrested at the mid-P4 stage in tcd5 plants at 20 degrees C. We performed positional cloning of TCD5 and then complementation and knock-down experiments, and the results showed that the transcript LOC_Os05g34040.1 from the LOC_Os05g34040 gene corresponded to the tcd5 phenotype. TCD5 encodes a conserved plastid-targeted monooxygenase family protein which has not been previously reported associated with a temperature-sensitive albino phenotype in plants. TCD5 is abundantly expressed in young leaves and immature spikes, and low temperatures increased this expression. The transcription of some genes involved in plastid transcription/translation and photosynthesis varied in the tcd5 mutant. Although the phenotype and temperature dependence of the TCD5 orthologous mutant phenotype were different in rice and Arabidopsis, OsTCD5 could rescue the phenotype of the Arabidopsis mutant, suggesting that TCD5 function is conserved between monocots and dicots.

TI Rymkiewicz's Telescope: Mediumistic Auto/Biographies of Modern
   Classicism
SO TEKSTY DRUGIE
AB Wojda explores Jaroslaw Marek Rymkiewicz's biographies and autobiographies as presented in his prose, poetry, drama, translations and literary studies. Based on the hermeneutical principle that writing about others is also writing about oneself, Rymkiewicz's (auto)biographies blend into one single discourse, and the metaphor of the telescope corresponds to the mediumship of this discourse. In the poet's modern classicism, this mediumship is related to the formula of imitation as an intermediary between texts and persons an intermediary in which equal weight is given to similarities and differences, closeness and distance. Reading Rymkiewicz's works, especially the poem Exegi monumentum from the collection Thema regium (1978), Wojda draws attention to the paradoxical practice of combining mimeticism with fiction, bodily empiricism with the role of signs, cognition with creation. Assuming a diachronic perspective, Wojda shows that Rymkiewicz's cultural hermeneutics transitioned into a micro-historical hermeneutics of existence,"the text of life'.

SO RENAISSANCE AND REFORMATION
AB The drama of Seneca exercised a major influence on the development of French tragedy in the sixteenth century. His tragedy Agamemnon is thus the origin of plays by Charles Toutain, Roland Brisset and Pierre Matthieu. From one author to another, divergence from the source text became more and more considerable. Initially undertaken by Toutain to enrich the French language, translation became more like imitation with Brisset, in order to educate the public by offering to mediate the unlucky fate of the ancients. The play by Matthieu proposed a new interpretation of the myth by resorting to the invention of scenes and dialogues. The modifications to the original intrigue contributed to a more political orientation of the myth of Agamemnon, through the development of the theme of the destruction of Troy and the inflexion given to the character of Agamemnon, portrayed as both an expiatory victim and a king paying the price of his ambition.

TI eIF3 Peripheral Subunits Rearrangement after mRNA Binding and
   Start-Codon Recognition
SO MOLECULAR CELL
AB mRNA translation initiation in eukaryotes requires the cooperation of a dozen eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) forming several complexes, which leads to mRNA attachment to the small ribosomal 40S subunit, mRNA scanning for start codon, and accommodation of initiator tRNA at the 40S P site. eIF3, composed of 13 subunits, 8 core (a, c, e, f, h, l, k, and m) and 5 peripheral (b, d, g, i, and j), plays a central role during this process. Here we report a cryoelectron microscopy structure of a mammalian 48S initiation complex at 5.8 angstrom resolution. It shows the relocation of subunits eIF3i and eIF3g to the 40S intersubunit face on the GTPase binding site, at a late stage in initiation. On the basis of a previous study, we demonstrate the relocation of eIF3b to the 40S intersubunit face, binding below the eIF2-Met-tRNAi Met ternary complex upon mRNA attachment. Our analysis reveals the deep rearrangement of eIF3 and unravels the molecular mechanism underlying eIF3 function in mRNA scanning and timing of ribosomal subunit joining.

TI Aiding and abetting cancer: mRNA export and the nuclear pore
SO TRENDS IN CELL BIOLOGY
AB mRNA export is a critical step in gene expression. Export of transcripts can be modulated in response to cellular signaling or stress. Consistently, mRNA export is dysregulated in primary human specimens derived from many different forms of cancer. Aberrant expression of export factors can alter the export of specific transcripts encoding proteins involved in proliferation, survival, and oncogenesis. These specific factors, which are not used for bulk mRNA export, are obvious therapeutic targets. Indeed, given the emerging role of mRNA export in cancer, it is not surprising that efforts to target different aspects of this pathway have reached the clinical trial stage. Thus, like transcription and translation, mRNA export may also play a critical role in cancer genesis and maintenance.

TI Tryptophanyl-tRNA Synthetase as a Potential Therapeutic Target
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB Tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (WRS) is an essential enzyme that catalyzes the ligation of tryptophan (Trp) to its cognate tRNA(trp) during translation via aminoacylation. Interestingly, WRS also plays physiopathological roles in diseases including sepsis, cancer, and autoimmune and brain diseases and has potential as a pharmacological target and therapeutic. However, WRS is still generally regarded simply as an enzyme that produces Trp in polypeptides; therefore, studies of the pharmacological effects, therapeutic targets, and mechanisms of action of WRS are still at an emerging stage. This review summarizes the involvement of WRS in human diseases. We hope that this will encourage further investigation into WRS as a potential target for drug development in various pathological states including infection, tumorigenesis, and autoimmune and brain diseases.

TI From Literature to Cultural Literacy: Introduction
SO TEKSTY DRUGIE
AB Naomi Segal's introduction to the volume From Literature to Cultural Literacy (which she edited with Daniela Koleva) focuses on the recent shift in literary scholarship away from poems, fiction or dramas. This shift, which concerns researchers as well as the discipline itself, results from a growing interest in contemporary social and cultural issues. It has led to the transformation of literary scholarship into literary-and-cultural studies - a field that is based on four key concepts: textuality, fictionality, rhetoricity, and historicity. These concepts designate both the object and the method of research. Segal discusses how they have been used in the articles in the volume, in relation to four academic fields, namely cultural memory, migration and translation, electronic textuality, and biopolitics and the body. She also outlines the ways in which contributors have used the notion of cultural literacy, a method of analysing social and cultural problems, in which literary critical competencies turn out to be useful or even essential.

   tumor biology: From molecular mechanisms to therapeutic significance
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB Accumulating evidence has revealed that m(6)A modification, the predominant RNA modification in eukaryotes, adds a novel layer of regulation to the gene expression. Dynamic and reversible m(6)A modification implements sophisticated and crucial functions in RNA metabolism, including generation, splicing, stability, and translation in messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Furthermore, m(6)A modification plays a determining role in producing various m(6)A-labeling RNA outcomes, thereby affecting several functional processes, including tumorigenesis and progression. Herein, we highlighted current advances in m(6)A modification and the regulatory mechanisms underlying mRNAs and ncRNAs in distinct cancer stages. Meanwhile, we also focused on the therapeutic significance of m(6)A regulators in clinical cancer treatment.

TI Perturbing the metabolic dynamics of myo-inositol in developing Brassica
   napus seeds through in vivo methylation impacts its utilization as
   phytate precursor and affects downstream metabolic pathways
SO BMC PLANT BIOLOGY
AB Background: myo-Inositol (Ins) metabolism during early stages of seed development plays an important role in determining the distributional relationships of some seed storage components such as the antinutritional factors, sucrose galactosides (also known as raffinose oligosaccharides) and phytic acid (PhA) (myo-inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate). The former is a group of oligosaccharides, which plays a role in desiccation at seed maturation. They are not easily digested by monogastric animals, hence their flatulence-causing properties. Phytic acid is highly negatively charged, which chelates positive ions of essential minerals and decreases their bioavailability. It is also a major cause of phosphate-related water pollution. Our aim was to investigate the influence of competitive diversion of Ins as common substrate on the biosynthesis of phytate and sucrose galactosides.
   Results: We have studied the initial metabolic patterns of Ins in developing seeds of Brassica napus and determined that early stages of seed development are marked by rapid deployment of Ins into a variety of pathways, dominated by interconversion of polar (Ins phosphates) and non-polar (phospholipids) species. In a time course experiment at early stages of seed development, we show Ins to be a highly significant constituent of the endosperm and seed coat, but with no phytate biosynthesis occurring in either tissue. Phytate accumulation appears to be confined mainly within the embryo throughout seed development and maturation. In our approach, the gene for myo-inositol methyltransferase (IMT), isolated from Mesembryanthemum crystallinum (ice plant), was transferred to B. napus under the control of the seed-specific promoters, napin and phaseolin. Introduction of this new metabolic step during seed development prompted Ins conversion to the corresponding monomethyl ether, ononitol, and affected phytate accumulation. We were able to produce homozygous transgenic lines with 19% - 35% average phytate reduction. Additionally, changes in the raffinose content and related sugars occurred along with enhanced sucrose levels. Germination rates, viability and other seed parameters were unaffected by the IMT transgene over-expression.
   Conclusions: Competitive methylation of Ins during seed development reduces seed antinutritional components and enhances its nutritional characteristics while maintaining adequate phosphate reserves. Such approach should potentially raise the canola market value and likely, that of other crops.

TI Psychometric Properties of the Diabetes Management Self-Efficacy Scale
   in Korean Patients with Type 2 Diabetes
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Objectives. The aims of this study were to perform a cultural translation of the DMSES and evaluate the psychometric properties of the translated scale in a Korean population with type 2 diabetics. Methods. This study was conducted in patients with diabetes recruited from university hospitals. The first stage of this study involved translating the DMSES into Korean using a forward- and backward-translation technique. The content validity was assessed by an expert group. In the second stage, the psychometric properties of the Korean version of the DMSES (K-DMSES) were evaluated. Results. The content validity of the K-DMSES was satisfactory. Sixteen-items clustered into four-subscales were extracted by exploratory factor analysis, and supported by confirmatory factor analysis. The construct validity of the K-DMSES with the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities scale was satisfactory (r = 0.50, P < 0.001). The Cronbach's alpha and intraclass correlation coefficient were 0.92 and 0.85 (P < 0.001; 95% CI = 0.75-0.91), respectively, which indicate excellent internal consistency reliability and test-retest reliability. Conclusions. The K-DMSES is a brief instrument that has demonstrated good psychometric properties. It is therefore feasible to use in practice, and is ready for use in clinical research involving Korean patients with type 2 diabetes.

TI On the short but eventful life of Abdulhalim Memduh
SO MIDDLE EASTERN STUDIES
AB Reforms introduced in 1839 (known as the Tanzimat) which were intended to modernize the Ottoman political and administrative structure, led inevitably to movements which introduced new literary ideas into the Ottoman cultural sphere. One of the first writers who wished to see Ottoman literature catch up with developments in Europe was Abdulhalim Memduh (1866 - 1905). His contributions covered the areas of poetry, prose, drama, journalism and political activism. Memduh was not content with using classical chronicles; he published at the age of 22 the very first History of Ottoman Literature in Turkish, which served as the model for subsequent literary histories. Later, in his short life, he collaborated with Edmond Fazy, a Swiss writer, to publish a book in Paris titled Anthologie de l'amour turc, which contains Turkish love poems in French translation for the first time. This article evaluates the contributions of Abdulhalim Memduh in order to give him a place among the pioneers of 20th century Turkish literature.

TI Unexpected Creatures: Procreative Liberty and the Frankenstein Ballet
SO HASTINGS CENTER REPORT
AB One of the most recent and original adaptations of Mary Wollstonecraft (Godwin) Shelley's Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus (1818) is the ballet version choreographed by Liam Scarlett and performed by the Royal Ballet in 2016 and the San Francisco Ballet in 2017 and 2018. What emerges from this translation is an economical, emotionally wrenching, and visually elegant drama of family tragedy from which we can draw a cautionary tale about contemporary bioethical dilemmas in family making that new and forthcoming biomedical technologies present. This performance of bodies interacting suggests the need for an ethics of acceptance and recognition as people navigate complex familial relationships involving procreative liberty, questions of moral personhood, and parental obligation. In the Frankenstein ballet, the narrative genre of dance-what I'll call "story in the flesh"-invites viewers to identify with the characters and enter into the complexity of interpersonal relations. The ballet becomes a compelling testimony about possible unintended outcomes set in motion by well-intended fallible humans like themselves.

TI Broadway Theatre Fans: communities of narrators and translators
SO POPULAR ENTERTAINMENT STUDIES
AB Theatre fans form vital audience communities that contribute much to the theatrical event. There has been ample discourse about media fans, yet there is a dearth of research into the vibrant theatre fan audience communities that abound on Broadway. Twenty-first century New York theatre fan communities share similar practices with their late nineteenth and early twentieth century predecessors the Bowery b'hoys and the matinee girls. The guiding principles of fan behaviour considered in this article are theatre fans' search for, and construction of community identity through narration and translation. Fan practices that began in the nineteenth century are compared with twenty-first century practices. Broadway theatre fans emerge as communities of narrators and translators who appropriate the stories onstage and stake their ownership of stars and productions. Caroline Heim is a Lecturer in Drama at the Queensland University of Technology. Her latest book, Audience as Performer: the changing role of theatre audiences in the twenty-first century was published by Routledge in 2016.

TI Phase-contrast virtual chest radiography
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Respiratory X-ray imaging enhanced by phase contrast has shown improved airway visualization in animal models. Limitations in current X-ray technology have nevertheless hindered clinical translation, leaving the potential clinical impact an open question. Here, we explore phase-contrast chest radiography in a realistic in silico framework. Specifically, we use preprocessed virtual patients to generate in silico chest radiographs by Fresnel-diffraction simulations of X-ray wave propagation. Following a reader study conducted with clinical radiologists, we predict that phase-contrast edge enhancement will have a negligible impact on improving solitary pulmonary nodule detection (6 to 20 mm). However, edge enhancement of bronchial walls visualizes small airways (<2 mm), which are invisible in conventional radiography. Our results show that phase-contrast chest radiography could play a future role in observing small-airway obstruction (e.g., relevant for asthma or early-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), which cannot be directly visualized using current clinical methods, thereby motivating the experimental development needed for clinical translation. Finally, we discuss quantitative requirements on distances and X-ray source/detector specifications for clinical implementation of phase-contrast chest radiography.

TI Brumoy and the invention of Tragedy: some issues of a relativist
   position
SO CAHIERS MONDES ANCIENS
AB Brumoy's reflections on the birth of tragedy bring together, in 1730, the various propositions of the previous century; they seemingly epitomise the way French Classicism construes the origin of drama and the notion of invention, as it connects the former to what they theorize not as civilisation, but as politeness: an origin framed in retrospect, meant to justify paradoxically a linear conception which leads to claim both the continuity between classical Greece and 17th-century France, and a line of progress by which the French nation is to be sacred as the leader of a genre that their famous ancestors have initiated, but that they have brought to its apogee. That two-fold strategy, which in Brumoy's mind ought to reconcile the Ancients and the Moderns, relies on the theorisation of a balanced relativism, thanks to which he avoids both the criticisms leveled by the Moderns at shows they judge too barbaric for a modern public, and the philological approach of the Ancients Brumoy thought was unable to translate the spirit of the originals and have them appreciated.

TI Country Reporting on the Sustainable Development Goals?The Politics of
   Performance Review at the Global-National Nexus*
SO JOURNAL OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AND CAPABILITIES
AB With the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), debates on governance through goal-setting and performance review have gained momentum. In this article, we explore how the politics of performance review played out in public sustainable development reporting at the global-national nexus. By examining the case of Swedish reporting to the United Nations High Level Political Forum in 2017, we find policy translation, accountability preparation and identity formation to be key functions of SDG reporting. We draw attention to the performative and political features of these functions in the sustainable development realm. With a fast approaching deadline, policy translation of global indicators to the national context glossed over politically contentious issues. Reporting served to enable peer review among governments rather than hierarchical accountability of domestic politics. Moreover, the identity formation function of SDG reporting was strong on the international stage while domestically it was challenged by broader political struggles. In conclusion, our study bears witness of the formative power of public reporting for SDG governance. We call for comparative research to allow for further theory-building on the politics of public reporting on sustainable development.

TI Co-expression Network Analysis Identified Key Proteins in Association
   With Hepatic Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
SO PROTEOMICS CLINICAL APPLICATIONS
AB Purpose Intense efforts have been made in colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment in recent decades. However, the mechanism of development and metastasis of CRC has not been fully cleared. This study is designed to identify key proteins involved in stage III and hepatic metastatic CRC. Experiment design Protein expression profiles of paired tumor and benign tissue samples from stage III and hepatic metastatic CRC patients are characterized by using a label-free proteomics approach. Key proteins relevant to hepatic metastatic CRC are revealed by weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and other bioinformatics tools. Results WGCNA reveals three hub modules: CRC without specific stage (turquoise), stage III CRC (blue), and hepatic metastatic CRC (green). Nine key proteins (heat shock protein family D member 1 (HSPD1), eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 gamma, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1, fibrinogen beta chain (FGB), Talin 1, adaptor related protein complex 2 subunit alpha 2, serrate RNA effector molecule homolog, apolipoprotein C3, phosphoglucomutase 5) are identified. Moreover, upregulation of HSPD1 is validated in CRC tissue by the immunohistochemistry. Upregulation of fibrinogen is validated in metastatic CRC by plasma fibrinogen assay. Conclusion and clinical relevance This study provides the proteomic analysis of stage III and hepatic metastatic CRC to identify key proteins of CRC. FGB plays a key role to serve as diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers for hepatic metastatic CRC.

These include both the power games of global finance, and those disasters that ostensibly concern other strands of geopolitics. The article focuses on two plays, The Comedy of Errors and Pericles, the actions of which unfold in the eastern Mediterranean - an area of the world associated, in the late modern imagination, either with mobility as pleasure (mass tourism and its apparatus) or mobility as crisis (disputed territories, the plight of displaced populations). It highlights the close bonds between prevalent modes - satire and farce in The Comedy of Errors, romance in Pericles - and the plays' distinct strategies for representing human mobility: the sense of agency proper to acquisitive urges, the victimhood of forced displacement.

TI Beethoven Translating Shakespeare: Dramatic Models for the Slow Movement
   of the String Quartet Op. 18, No. 1
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MUSICOLOGICAL SOCIETY
AB According to a footnote in a treatise on music aesthetics of 1856, Beethoven claimed to have had in mind the scene in the burial vault in Romeo and Juliet when he composed the Adagio of op. 18, no. 1. The Shakespeare connection has persisted because, as scholars since Nottebohm have noticed, it is supported by four (French-language) inscriptions in Beethoven's sketches. We ought to ask, however, Which version of the vault scene-that is, which Romeo and Juliet ? As a consequence of eighteenth-century practices of theatrical adaptation, the play was available in various forms. Among contemporary French sources, Steibelt's opera (1793) may be ruled out as a model. Jean-Francois Ducis's adaptation (1772) shows striking concordances with the sketchbook inscriptions, but we have no direct evidence that Beethoven knew it. He arguably knew three different stage versions-all unlikely models: Weisse's bourgeois tragedy (1767) rejected Shakespeare's ending; Gotter and Benda's singspiel rendition (1776) ended happily; and Zingarelli's tragedia per musica (1796) had the title characters sing a final duet in E-flat major, despite the tragic circumstances. Among the available translations, Beethoven acquired Eschenburg's Romeo und Julia (1779 or earlier), but probably not before composing his quartet. However, the appearance in Berlin of A. W. Schlegel's translation of the vault scene coincided with Beethoven's arrival there in May 1796. This masterful poetical translation may have planted the idea realized in the Adagio of op. 18, no. 1. We know (from a letter of 1810) how highly Beethoven regarded Schlegel's translation, Schindler's assertions to the contrary notwithstanding.

TI Unwinding the roles of RNA helicase MOV10
SO WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-RNA
AB MOV10 is an RNA helicase that associates with the RNA-induced silencing complex component Argonaute (AGO), likely resolving RNA secondary structures. MOV10 also binds the Fragile X mental retardation protein to block AGO2 binding at some sites and associates with UPF1, a principal component of the nonsense-mediated RNA decay pathway. MOV10 is widely expressed and has a key role in the cellular response to viral infection and in suppressing retrotransposition. Posttranslational modifications of MOV10 include ubiquitination, which leads to stimulation-dependent degradation, and phosphorylation, which has an unknown function. MOV10 localizes to the nucleus and/or cytoplasm in a cell type-specific and developmental stage-specific manner. Knockout of Mov10 leads to embryonic lethality, underscoring an important role in development where it is required for the completion of gastrulation. MOV10 is expressed throughout the organism; however, most studies have focused on germline cells and neurons. In the testes, the knockdown of Mov10 disrupts proliferation of spermatogonial progenitor cells. In brain, MOV10 is significantly elevated postnatally and binds mRNAs encoding cytoskeleton and neuron projection proteins, suggesting an important role in neuronal architecture. Heterozygous Mov10 mutant mice are hyperactive and anxious and their cultured hippocampal neurons have reduced dendritic arborization. Zygotic knockdown of Mov10 in Xenopus laevis causes abnormal head and eye development and mislocalization of neuronal precursors in the brain. Thus, MOV10 plays a vital role during development, defense against viral infection and in neuronal development and function: its many roles and regulation are only beginning to be unraveled.

TI C/EBP beta-LAP*/LAP Expression Is Mediated by RSK/eIF4B-Dependent
   Signalling and Boosted by Increased Protein Stability in Models of
   Monocytic Differentiation
SO PLOS ONE
AB The transcription factor C/EBP beta plays a key role in monocytic differentiation and inflammation. Its small isoform LIP is associated with proliferation at early premonocytic developmental stages and regulated via mTOR-dependent signalling. During later stages of (pre) monocytic differentiation there is a considerable increase in the large C/EBP beta isoforms LAP*/LAP which inhibit proliferation thus supporting terminal differentiation. Here, we showed in different models of monocytic differentiation that this dramatic increase in the LAP*/LAP protein and LAP/LIP ratio was accompanied by an only modest/retarded mRNA increase suggesting an important role for (post) translational mechanisms. We found that LAP*/LAP formation was induced via MEK/RSK-dependent cascades, whereas mTOR/S6K1 were not involved. Remarkably, LAP*/LAP expression was dependent on phosphorylated eIF4B, an acceleratory protein of RNA helicase eIF4A. PKR inhibition reduced the expression of eIF4B and C/EBP beta in an eIF2 alpha-independent manner. Furthermore, under our conditions a marked stabilisation of LAP*/LAP protein occurred, accompanied by reduced chymotrypsin-like proteasome/calpain activities and increased calpastatin levels. Our study elucidates new signalling pathways inducing LAP*/LAP expression and indicates new alternative PKR functions in monocytes. The switch from mTOR- to RSK-mediated signalling to orchestrate eIF4B-dependent LAP*/LAP translation, accompanied by increased protein stability but only small mRNA changes, may be a prototypical example for the regulation of protein expression during selected processes of differentiation/proliferation.

TI Molecular alterations during larval development of Haemonchus contortus
   in vitro are under tight post-transcriptional control
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY
AB In this study, we explored the molecular alterations in the developmental switch from the L3 to the exsheathed L3 (xL3) and to the L4 stage of Haemonchus contortus in vitro using an integrated transcriptomic, proteomic and bioinformatic approach. Totals of 9,754 mRNAs, 88 microRNAs (miRNAs) and 1,591 proteins were identified, and 6,686 miRNA-mRNA pairs inferred in all larval stages studied. Approximately 16% of transcripts in the combined transcriptome (representing all three larval stages) were expressed as proteins, and there were positive correlations (r = 0.39-0.44) between mRNA transcription and protein expression in the three distinct developmental stages of the parasite. Of the predicted targets, 1,019 (27.0%) mRNA transcripts were expressed as proteins, and there was a negative correlation (r = -0.60 to -0.50) in the differential mRNA transcription and protein expression between developmental stages upon pairwise comparison. The changes in transcription (mRNA and miRNA) and protein expression from the free-living to the parasitic life cycle phase of H. contortus related to enrichments in biological pathways associated with metabolism (e.g., carbohydrate and lipid degradation, and amino acid metabolism), environmental information processing (e.g., signal transduction, signalling molecules and interactions) and/or genetic information processing (e.g., transcription and translation). Specifically, fatty acid degradation, steroid hormone biosynthesis and the Rap1 signalling pathway were suppressed, whereas transcription, translation and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum were upregulated during the transition from the free-living L3 to the parasitic xL3 and L4 stages of the nematode in vitro. Dominant post-transcriptional regulation was inferred to elicit these changes, and particular miRNAs (e.g., hco-miR-34 and hco-miR-252) appear to play roles in stress responses and/or environmental adaptations during developmental transitions of H. contortus. Taken together, these integrated results provide a comprehensive insight into the developmental biology of this important parasite at the molecular level in vitro. The approach applied here to H. contortus can be readily applied to other parasitic nematodes. (C) 2018 Australian Society for Parasitology. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Contemporary Albanian Literature in Kosovo (Now and Here)
SO BALKANISTIC FORUM
AB Albanian literature written from the 1940s to the present day can be called contemporary Albanian literature, or in other words, World Literature after the Second World War. The allowed literature was the only method of socialist realism, which was ideologized and politicized, i.e. subject to communist ideology and politics. It was not free literature, but entirely engaged in the service of socialism and communism. The method of socialist realism had some very narrow and binding criteria for all those who thought of publishing their works. Such were the communist members, the positive hero and the struggle against foreign middle-class influences. In such a situation, we can say that it was purely subject to ideology and communist politics. Due to its very narrow scheme, most of the literary work written during this period had its own value and function during the period of the communist system. This type of literature form some writers was accepted with conviction, while others were used to compromise to publish their works. Although under very strict censure, many important works were published which could have been contrary to socialist realism. Such works were with an indirect expression or with a subtext, often in symbolic and allegorical forms. These works consist of some of the greatest values of contemporary Albanian literature, the first and the foremost authors of this kind of literature, their best works, publishers, and their echoes in the language of translation.

TI The role of circular RNAs in pulmonary hypertension
SO EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY JOURNAL
AB Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are endogenous, covalently circularised, non-protein-coding RNAs generated from back-splicing. Most circRNAs are very stable, highly conserved, and expressed in a tissue-, cell-and developmental stage-specific manner. circRNAs play a significant role in various biological processes, such as regulation of gene expression and protein translation via sponging of microRNAs and binding with RNA-binding proteins. circRNAs have become a topic of great interest in research due to their close link with the development of various diseases. Their high stability, conservation and abundance in body fluids make them promising biomarkers for many diseases. A growing body of evidence suggests that aberrant expression of circRNAs and their targets plays a crucial role in pulmonary vascular remodelling and pulmonary arterial hypertension (group 1) as well as other forms (groups 3 and 4) of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Here we discuss the roles and molecular mechanisms of circRNAs in the pathogenesis of pulmonary vascular remodelling and PH. We also highlight the therapeutic and biomarker potential of circRNAs in PH.

AB Translations from German and Russian (Heinrich Heine, Aleksander Blok, Konstantin Simonov and others), which Kross sent from Siberia to the critic Lumet in Estonia but which were not published, are considered in the second part of Kross's correspondence. Of great interest is Kross's somewhat ironic brief autobiography from 1954, where he also mentions his articles on foreign policy that were published during the first year of Soviet occupation in 1940-1941, but which have hitherto not been identified. Kross continues his criticism of the linguistic ineptitude of Soviet Estonian literary criticism (ideological criticism was inconceivable at that time). His play on American themes, Marc Edfordi kaitsekone (Marc Edford's Defence), which he completed in Siberia, is thoroughly analysed in the correspondence with Lumet, and Lumet predicts - sincerely or hypocritically, nobody knows - that it would be a great success in Estonian theatres. Naturally, the play did not make it to the stage but it has been preserved in manuscript form. Its plot and structure are publicised here for the first time.

TI Emerging functions of helicases in regulation of stress survival in
   malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and their comparison with human
   host
SO PARASITOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
AB The cellular response to various stresses is a universal phenomenon and involves a common set of stress responses that are largely independent of the type of stress. The response to stress is complex and cells can activate multiple signaling pathways that act in concert to influence cell fate and results in a specific cellular outcome, including reduction in macromolecular synthesis by shared pathways, cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, senescence and/or apoptosis. Whether cells mount a protective response or die depends to a great degree on the nature and duration of the stress and the particular cell type. Helicases play essential roles in DNA replication, repair, recombination, transcription and translation, and also participate in RNA metabolic processes including pre-mRNA processing, ribosome biogenesis, RNA turnover, export, translation, surveillance, storage and decay. In order to survive in the human host, the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum has to handle variety of stresses, which it encounters during the erythrocytic stages of its life cycle. In recent past the role of helicases in imparting various stress responses has emerged. Therefore in the present review an attempt has been made to highlight the emerging importance of helicases in stress responses in malaria parasite and their comparison with human host is also presented. It is noteworthy that PfDHX33 and PIDDX60 are larger in size and different in sequence as compared to the HsDHX33 and HsDDX60. The study suggests that helicases are multifunctional and play major role in helping the cells to combat various stresses. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI "A Positive Statement of a Negative Thing": Nietzschean Eternal
   Recurrence as Dramatic Form in Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot
SO MODERN DRAMA
AB Much has been written in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries about the pessimistic tenor of Samuel Beckett's middle-period plays. With specific reference to Waiting for Godot, however, this essay draws a distinction between the pessimistic appearance of the content that partially constitutes this text and the nature of the formal medium through which it is realized. In short, I argue that there is a critical disjunction between what this play says and what this play does. Conceptually speaking, this essay is primarily concerned with Beckett's textual engagement with the theory of eternal recurrence, that is, the idea that all occurrences have happened innumerable times before, and will happen again, and again, in an infinitely recurring cycle. Focusing on how Waiting for Godot developed, both in translation and as a performance piece under the direction of its author, I demonstrate that Beckett's metatheatrical dramatization of eternal recurrence explores this theory's capacity to function as an ethical imperative in the morally nihilistic atmosphere of post-Holocaust Europe. In doing so, Beckett's play implicates the viewer in a dramatization that is aligned with the axiological iteration of eternal recurrence that modern and contemporary scholars associate with Friedrich Nietzsche. Indeed, it is in this sense that Waiting for Godot is, as Beckett himself puts it, "a positive statement of a negative thing."

TI 'HIS BIG LETTER BOOK WITH ZULU AFFAIRS AT ONE END AND HORACE AT THE
   OTHER': Classics in the Colony
SO AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RHETORIC
AB The creation of the Union of South Africa in 1910 also saw the development of the Natal University College and the appointment of the region's first Professor of Classics, Alexander Petrie. To date the writing of the history of the reception of Classics within South Africa, in general, has limited itself to individual case studies. When, however, a broader view has been taken, the scope of the project, both historically and geographically, has necessarily limited the detail of the discussion. Additionally, the field has been dominated by a geographical bent towards the Cape. When the focus has been on Natal, it has often been limited to university-level (or university-related) interaction with the discipline (e. g. departmental reports of the activities of the Natal Branch of the Classical Association of South Africa, biographical obituaries of university lecturers, or reviews of university-led productions of Greek drama). In this paper, therefore, I attempt to go further back, to the beginnings of the history of classical engagement in the Natal Colony (1843-1910). Rather than attempting a comprehensive sketch, in this article I seek to highlight only a few specific British examples of the uses made of their classical education by individuals who could be labelled 'predecessors to Petrie' - that is, educated Victorian men who for various reasons found themselves in the Natal Colony.

SO CONTRAST MEDIA & MOLECULAR IMAGING
AB The optical imaging plays an increasing role in preclinical studies, particularly in cancer biology. The combined ultrasound and optical imaging, named photoacoustic imaging (PAI), is an emerging hybrid technique for real-time molecular imaging in preclinical research and recently expanding into clinical setting. PAI can be performed using endogenous contrast, particularly from oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin and melanin, or exogenous contrast agents, sometimes targeted for specific biomarkers, providing comprehensive morphofunctional and molecular information on tumor microenvironment. Overall, PAI has revealed notable opportunities to improve knowledge on tumor pathophysiology and on the biological mechanisms underlying therapy. The aim of this review is to introduce the principles of PAI and to provide a brief overview of current PAI applications in preclinical research, highlighting also on recent advances in clinical translation for cancer diagnosis, staging, and therapy.

TI The Legend of Ashoka's Hell and References to the Torture Chamber of the
   Mauryan Emperor in Ajneya's Play Uttar Priyadarsi
SO ACADEMIC JOURNAL OF MODERN PHILOLOGY
AB This paper discusses the legend of Ashoka's hell relating to the ancient Indian emperor of Maurya dynasty and his conversion to Buddhism as depicted by the Hindi writer Ajneya(1) (1911-1987) in his play Uttar Priyadarsi of 1967 as well as references made by him to a torture chamber in the imperial palace in Pataliputra. The thesis proposed here is that Ajneya, while re-telling the old Buddhist legend and referring it to the emperor's material prison, seeks to renew how it is perceived and prove its underlying concept. While looking for overlaps between history and legend and focusing on Ashoka's prison-hell, he aims to present the truth about the reason and manner of the emperor's conversion. References to the Buddhist story in Indian and Chinese versions and history of Ashoka are studied to reveal their mutual role in the play. His version of the tale is compared to the relevant part of the Asokavadana, regarded as the most reliable source on the legend of Ashoka. It is illustrated by passages from Ajneya's play translated for the first time in this paper and the available English translations of the Asokavadana with some references to its text in Sanskrit. The analysis presented here proves that the playwright emphasises descriptions of torture and terror that correspond to the state of Ashoka's mind, which is tormented by the phantoms of war against the state of Kalinga. Thus, he provides psychological insight into the main protagonist's Self. Ajneya transforms the legend by making the emperor's regret the main reason for his renunciation of war and conversion to Buddhism. He also changes its ending so that it suits the final message of his play. Priyadarshi's salvation from hell has to be read as liberation from one's exaggerated Self, the reason for his suffering, which is only possible once it is renounced. The analysis proves Ajneya's skills in evoking an ancient dramatic style, and language while presenting Ashoka's dilemma as a modern conflict. In the end, the motif of "entering hell" is referred to as one of the oldest known topoi in world literature.

TI Focusing on discoidin domain receptors in premalignant and malignant
   liver diseases
SO FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
AB Discoidin domain receptors (DDRs) are receptor tyrosine kinases on the membrane surface that bind to extracellular collagens, but they are rarely expressed in normal liver tissues. Recent studies have demonstrated that DDRs participate in and influence the processes underlying premalignant and malignant liver diseases. A brief overview of the potential roles of DDR1 and DDR2 in premalignant and malignant liver diseases is presented. DDR1 has proinflammatory and profibrotic benefits and promotes the invasion, migration and liver metastasis of tumour cells. However, DDR2 may play a pathogenic role in early-stage liver injury (prefibrotic stage) and a different role in chronic liver fibrosis and in metastatic liver cancer. These views are critically significant and first described in detail in this review. The main purpose of this review was to describe how DDRs act in premalignant and malignant liver diseases and their potential mechanisms through an in-depth summary of preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies. Our work aims to provide new ideas for cancer treatment and accelerate translation from bench to bedside.

TI Roles of lncRNAs in brain development and pathogenesis: Emerging
   therapeutic opportunities
SO MOLECULAR THERAPY
AB The human genome is pervasively transcribed, producing a majority of short and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that can influence cellular programs through a variety of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mecha- nisms. The brain houses the richest repertoire of long noncoding transcripts, which function at every stage during central nervous system development and homeostasis. An example of functionally relevant lncRNAs is species involved in spatiotemporal organization of gene expression in different brain regions, which play roles at the nuclear level and in transport, translation, and decay of other transcripts in specific neuronal sites. Research in the field has enabled identification of the contributions of specific lncRNAs to certain brain diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkin- son's disease, cancer, and neurodevelopmental disorders, re- sulting in notions of potential therapeutic strategies that target these RNAs to recover the normal phenotype. Here, we summarize the latest mechanistic findings associated with lncRNAs in the brain, focusing on their dysregulation in neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative disorders, their use as biomarkers for central nervous system (CNS) diseases in vitro and in vivo, and their potential utility for therapeu- tic strategies.

TI Ribosomal protein s15a (RPS15A) knockdown inhibits thyroid cancer cell
   proliferation through induction of apoptosis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE
AB Thyroid cancer has become one of the most common endocrine tumors with a growing incidence. In this study, we identified Ribosomal protein s15a (RPS15A), which mediates the interaction of mRNA and ribosome in the early stage of translation, as an anti-apoptotic protein in the thyroid cancer cells. Knockdown of RPS15A significantly inhibited the proliferation of TT cells, a medullary thyroid cancer cell line with high malignancy. Two different shRNA sequences targeting RPS15A could both specifically down-regulate its endogenous expression, as determined by Real-Time PCR and Western Blot. The inhibited proliferation was related to the cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and an elevated apoptosis in response to RPS15A knockdown determined by flow cytometry. Mechanically, we found that RPS15A-silencing promoted apoptosis through enhancing the expression of bad, bax and p53, whereas through decreasing the levels of survivin and bcl-2. Finally, through the data-mining public Oncomine microarray datasets, we identified that RPS15A was upregulated in thyroid cancer tissues in the TCGA Thyroid dataset. In conclusion, RPS15A plays an essential role in thyroid cancer cells and may be a potential therapeutic target in thyroid cancer.

TI RECENT STUDIES IN GEORGE CHAPMAN (1975-2009)
SO ENGLISH LITERARY RENAISSANCE
AB This essay surveys criticism of George Chapman from 1975 to 2009. 1998 saw the publication of a Penguin edition of some of his major works, and the inclusion of The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois in the Oxford University collection Four Revenge Tragedies. It also marked the beginning of the reissue of the Homeric translations in three volumes of affordable paperback editions, completed in 2008 with the publication of the final volume. At the same time, there has been a small but noticeable upsurge in scholarly publications treating his work. Central to much of this work is Chapman's engagement with political theory, particularly as it is conducted through his imagining of France. Other major strands in recent criticism include several pieces on economic themes in Eastward Ho, as well as a debate as to the nature and significance of the collaborative authorship of that play. The Widow's Tears has also attracted some significant attention, with critics often focusing on the representation of the widow figure. Many of the key debates take place with regards to particular texts, so this essay is organized in sections for the drama (further split into sections on each play); the poetry (again split into sections for each major poetic work); and the translations. There are sections detailing more general criticism at the beginning of the essay, and at the beginning of each new major section. (S. M.).

TI PETRARCHISM AS THE BASIS FOR THE TYPOLOGY OF THE DUBROVNIK (RAGUSAN)
   PASTORAL
SO KNJIZEVNA SMOTRA
AB Croatian literature has nourished the taste for Italian literature and has cultivated a lot of literary types that came out from Italy and spread over Europe. The cultivation of Platonic and Petrarch-style pastoral in Croatian literature leads from Dzore Drzic's eclogue to Mann Drzic's pastoral to Sasin's epigonic pastorals. Vetranovic and Naljeskovic's pastorals are part of a somewhat different semantic system. D. Zlataric published the earliest translation of Tasso's Aminta in 1580, a year before the publication of the original. F. Lukarevic Burina translated Pastora fida in 1592. In the seventeenth century the pastoral tradition was continued by Ivan Gundulic's Dubravka and Junije Palmotic's Atlanta but pastoral streak in those dramas lost its original value remaining as a decoration in the service of baroque poetics.
   In the Croatian pastoral drama the stage presents ways to achieve happiness: the path to one kind of happiness goes through terrestrial life, while the other is achieved through contemplation. The beauty of a nymph and the motive of her supernatural origin are linked to eternity. The beauty of reality resides in the form of a shepherdess but that is a temporary beauty. A pastoral separates urban space from the rustic (and ideal) space of shepherds and nymphs. Beside the style and language of Petrarchist lyrics the authors D. Drzic, N. Naljeskovic, M. Vetranovic and M. Drzic introduce the stylized everyday speech into the Croatian pastoral and so enable its autonomous development (in the works of Italian predecessors the elements of low style are rare and don't exceed the limits of the Bucolic and Vergilian traditions). Worlds, styles and languages don't tend towards mutual destruction but strive for co-existence. While the Italian pastoral followed Sannazzaro's way of artistic simplicity, the Croatian variant relied on a different mode to achieve comic effects.

SO DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROBIOLOGY
AB MicroRNAs regulate gene expression by destabilizing target mRNA and/or inhibiting translation in animal cells. The ability to mechanistically dissect miR-124 ' s function during specification, differentiation, and maturation of neurons during development within a single system has not been accomplished. Using the sea urchin embryo, we take advantage of the manipulability of the embryo and its well-documented gene regulatory networks (GRNs). We incorporated NeuroD1 as part of the sea urchin neuronal GRN and determined that miR-124 inhibition resulted in aberrant gut contractions, swimming velocity, and neuronal development. Inhibition of miR-124 resulted in an increased number of cells expressing transcription factors (TFs) associated with progenitor neurons and a concurrent decrease of mature and functional neurons. Results revealed that in the early blastula/gastrula stages, miR-124 regulates undefined factors during neuronal specification and differentiation. In the late gastrula/larval stages, miR-124 regulates Notch and NeuroD1 during the transition between neuronal differentiation and maturation. Overall, we have improved the neuronal GRN and identified miR-124 to play a prolific role in regulating various transitions of neuronal development.

TI THE NINETEENTH-CENTURY ITALIAN TRANSLATORS OF LORD BYRON'S MARINO
   FALIERO
SO QUADERNI D ITALIANISTICA
AB The tragic story of Marino Faliero, the Doge of Venice who was executed for high treason in 1355, came to the attention of writers and artists of various European countries during the early nineteenth century thanks to a number of historians who published insightful works on the history of the Venetian Republic. Among those who were fascinated by the irascible old warrior who tried to overthrow the oligarchy on becoming head of state was Lord Byron. In 1821, the English poet published the historical drama Marino Faliero, Doge of Venice on the tragic end of a hero whose personal grievances with the Venetian Senate intertwined with an ill-fated plebeian rebellion against the nobility. Byron's popularity in Italy brought the story to the attention of Italian romantic literary circles, where it was not only appreciated as a tragedy of honour and revenge, but also for its ideological implications in the context of the Risorgimento. This study focuses on the three translators who produced the first complete Italian versions of Byron's play published in the nineteenth century, namely Pasquale De Virgili, Giovan Battista Cereseto, and Andrea Maffei. Based on Andre Lefevere's theory on rewriting, it analyses the ideological and poetological reasons behind the translations, how the translators' intentions shaped the target texts, as well as the impact these translations had on Italian literature and the arts. The strategies adopted by the translators are also illustrated through a comparative textual analysis of a sample passage.

   videos for Sri Lankan context-a qualitative study
SO CONFLICT AND HEALTH
AB Background Understanding and addressing the unmet mental health needs burden in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka is the subject of the COMGAP-S two-phase study. Phase Two involves the implementation of the World Health Organization's mental health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) in primary healthcare settings. As part of the contextual adaptation of mhGAP, eleven of the videos provided in the mhGAP training package have been re-filmed by a local team. We investigated the challenges, barriers and good practices of this adaptation effort from the point of view of team participants. Methods Twelve persons from the adaptation team, including students of medicine and drama, doctors, drama lecturers and professionals, consented to in-depth individual interviews following an open-ended topic guide with a member of the COMGAP-S study team. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, translated as necessary, and subjected to thematic analysis. Results The majority of participants perceived the process positively and had pride in their involvement. Expectations, opportunities, and exposure were discussed as stemming from the video production. The main challenges derived from the analysis were lack of discussion around budgeting, logistical difficulties, struggles with team cooperation, and creative differences. Issues around exact translation into the local Tamil dialect and modelling around mental health were emphasised by the majority of participants. Potential uses for the videos were identified beyond the current study and recommendations included setting out clear guidance around available funding and role allocation, and increasing the flexibility in adapting the material. Conclusions This study illustrated details of the adaptation of existing video materials to facilitate locally-based training for non-specialists on mhGAP curricula. With this, we have added to the knowledge base on conducting cultural and language adaptations and our findings indicate participants felt adapting the mhGAP films to local context was vital to ensuring training materials were culturally appropriate and valid.

TI The Lure of Sadness: The Fever of Yueju and The Butterfly Lovers in the
   Early PRC
SO ASIAN THEATRE JOURNAL
AB The first decade of the newly formed People's Republic of China (PRC) has often been considered as the golden age of yueju, an all female theatre. It originated in the countryside of Zhejiang Province and became a popular form of theatre in the metropolis of Shanghai from the 1930s to the 1960s. In particular, the 1950s and 1960s were the crucial decades that saw yueju develop from a form of local drama into a national one, second only to jingju (Peking opera) in nationwide scale, gradually even developing an international influence. In the 1950s, the PRC adapted quite a few local operas into films and exported them throughout Asia, as well as Western countries, in hopes of promoting friendship with neighboring nations as well as blurring the boundaries of the Iron Curtain. The political movements of the early decade of the PRC, such as the reform of local drama genres and the propagation of the Marriage Law, certainly played a role in this cultural phenomenon. This article, however, will also give special attention to the role of the newly formed government's cultural diplomacy in stoking the yueju fever. I argue that its popularity in the 1950s not only needs to be understood in domestic terms but also should be historicized in the context of the Cold War.

TI HMGA2 and high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MEDICINE-JMM
AB HMGA2, the High Mobility Group A2 gene, plays a very important role in fetal development and carcinogenesis. As an oncofetal gene, it is upregulated in tumors of both epithelial and mesenchymal tissue origin. Chromosomal translocations of HMGA2 are common in mesenchymal tumors, whereas the regulatory mechanisms of HMGA2 in malignant epithelial tumors are much more complex. As an architectural transcription factor, it is involved in multiple biological pathways by targeting different downstream genes in different cancers. HMGA2 is upregulated in both the early and late stages of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) and, according to The Cancer Genomic Atlas, is among a signature of genes overexpressed in ovarian cancer. Recent identification of miR-182 as a mediator of BRCA1 and HMGA2 deregulation in ovarian cancer cells may guide us toward a better understanding of the roles of HMGA2 in ovarian carcinogenesis. In this article, we will review recent developments and findings related to HMGA2, including its regulation, oncogenic properties, major functional pathways associated with the tumorigenesis of HGSOC, and its potential role as a biomarker for clinical application.

TI Synchronized motion control and precision positioning compensation of a
   3-DOFs macro-micro parallel manipulator fully actuated by piezoelectric
   actuators
SO SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES
AB The macro-micro combined approach, as an effective way to realize trans-scale nano-precision positioning with multi-dimensions and high velocity, plays a significant role in integrated circuit manufacturing field. A 3-degree-of-freedoms (3-DOFs) macro-micro manipulator is designed and analyzed to compromise the conflictions among the large stroke, high precision and multi-DOFs. The macro manipulator is a 3-Prismatic-Revolute-Revolute (3-PRR) structure parallel manipulator which is driven by three linear ultrasonic motors. The dynamic model and the cross-coupling error based synchronized motion controller of the 3-PRR parallel manipulator are theoretical analyzed and experimental tested. To further improve the positioning accuracy, a 3-DOFs monolithic compliant manipulator actuated by three piezoelectric stack actuators is designed. Then a multilayer BP neural network based inverse kinematic model identifier is developed to perform the positioning control. Finally, by forming the macro-micro structure, the dual stage manipulator successfully achieved the positioning task from the point (2 mm, 2 mm, 0 rad) back to the original point (0 mm, 0 mm, 0 rad) with the translation errors in X and Y directions less than +/- 50 nm and the rotation error around Z axis less than +/- 1 mu rad, respectively.

TI Genome-wide maps of ribosomal occupancy provide insights into adaptive
   evolution and regulatory roles of uORFs during Drosophila development
SO PLOS BIOLOGY
AB Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) play important roles in regulating the main coding DNA sequences (CDSs) via translational repression. Despite their prevalence in the genomes, uORFs are overall discriminated against by natural selection. However, it remains unclear why in the genomes there are so many uORFs more conserved than expected under the assumption of neutral evolution. Here, we generated genome-wide maps of translational efficiency (TE) at the codon level throughout the life cycle of Drosophila melanogaster. We identified 35,735 uORFs that were expressed, and 32,224 (90.2%) of them showed evidence of ribosome occupancy during Drosophila development. The ribosome occupancy of uORFs is determined by genomic features, such as optimized sequence contexts around their start codons, a shorter distance to CDSs, and higher coding potentials. Our population genomic analysis suggests the segregating mutations that create or disrupt uORFs are overall deleterious in D. melanogaster. However, we found for the first time that many (68.3% of) newly fixed uORFs that are associated with ribosomes in D. melanogaster are driven by positive Darwinian selection. Our findings also suggest that uORFs play a vital role in controlling the translational program in Drosophila. Moreover, we found that many uORFs are transcribed or translated in a developmental stage-, sex-, or tissue-specific manner, suggesting that selective transcription or translation of uORFs could potentially modulate the TE of the downstream CDSs during Drosophila development.

TI EIF3B is associated with poor outcomes in gastric cancer patients and
   promotes cancer progression via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway
SO CANCER MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH
AB Purpose: Eukaryotic translation initiation factor (EIF) plays a vital role in protein synthesis. EIF3B is a core subunit of the EIF3 family, and is overexpressed in many tumors. EIF3B is associated with an unfavorable prognosis, as well as the genesis and development of tumors. However, the potential role of EIF3B in gastric cancer (GC) remains unknown. In the current study, we explored the clinical significance and the possible mechanism of EIF3B in the progression of GC.
   Methods: EIF3B expression was analyzed in 78 GC tissue samples through quantitative PCR and in 94 GC tissue samples through immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. The correlation between EIF3B and clinicopathological features was analyzed in GC tissues. The role of EIF3B in GC progression was investigated through in vitro and in vivo assays.
   Results: EIF3B expression was upregulated in GC tissues (73.4%, IHC). High expression of EIF3B was significantly correlated with the depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis and TNM stage (P=0.000, 0.000 and 0.000, respectively). Multivariate analysis indicated that GC patients with high EIF3B expression suffered a poorer 5-year survival. EIF3B promoted GC cell proliferation and was strongly associated with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression in GC samples (P=0.009). It also enhanced tumor cell migration and invasion, which were affected through epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the Stat3 signaling pathway. Knockdown of EIF3B in GC cells suppressed the growth of xenograft tumors and lung metastatic colonization in vivo. Furthermore, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and Western blot results demonstrated that EIF3B activated the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that EIF3B plays an oncogenic role in GC progression and serves as an independent prognostic factor for GC patients.

TI LeishIF4E1 Deletion Affects the Promastigote Proteome, Morphology, and
   Infectivity
SO MSPHERE
AB Leishmania parasites cycle between sand-fly vectors and mammalian hosts, adapting to changing environmental conditions by driving a stage-specific program of gene expression, which is tightly regulated by translation processes. Leishmania encodes six eIF4E orthologs (LeishlF4Es) and five e1F4G candidates, forming different cap-binding complexes with potentially varying functions. Most LeishIF4E paralogs display temperature sensitivity in their cap-binding activity, except for LeishIF4E1, which maintains its cap-binding activity under all conditions. We used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to successfully generate a null mutant of LeishIF4E1 and examine how its elimination affected parasite physiology. Although the LeishIF4E1(-/-) null mutant was viable, its growth was impaired, in line with a reduction in global translation. As a result of the mutation, the null LeishIF4E1(-/-) mutant had a defective morphology, as the cells were round and unable to grow a normal flagellum. This was further emphasized when the LeishIF4E1(-/-) cells failed to develop the promastigote morphology once they shifted from conditions that generate axenic amastigotes (33 degrees C, pH 5.5) back to neutral pH and 25 degrees C, and they maintained their short flagellum and circular structure. Finally, the LeishIF4E1(-/-) null mutant displayed difficulty in infecting cultured macrophages. The morphological changes and reduced infectivity of the mutant may be related to differences in the proteomic profile of LeishIF4E1(-/-) cells from that of controls. All defects monitored in the LeishIF4E1(-/-) null mutant were reversed in the add-back strain, in which expression of LeishIF4E1 was reconstituted, establishing a strong link between the cellular defects and the absence of LeishIF4E1 expression.
   IMPORTANCE Leishmania parasites are the causative agents of a broad spectrum of diseases. The parasites migrate between sand-fly vectors and mammalian hosts, adapting to changing environments by driving a regulated program of gene expression, with translation regulation playing a key role. The leishmanias encode six different paralogs of elF4E, the cap-binding translation initiation factor. Since these vary in function, expression profile, and assemblage, it is assumed that each is assigned a specific role throughout the life cycle. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 system for Leishmania, we generated a null mutant of LeishIF4E1, eliminating both alleles. Although the mutant cells were viable, their morphology was altered and their ability to synthesize the flagellum was impaired. Elimination of LeishIF4E1 affected their protein expression profile and decreased their ability to infect cultured macrophages. Restoring LeishIF4E1 expression restored the affected features. This study highlights the importance of LeishIF4E1 in diverse cellular events during the life cycle of Leishmania.

TI A dynamic alternative splicing program regulates gene expression during
   terminal erythropoiesis
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Alternative pre-messenger RNA splicing remodels the human transcriptome in a spatiotemporal manner during normal development and differentiation. Here we explored the landscape of transcript diversity in the erythroid lineage by RNA-seq analysis of five highly purified populations of morphologically distinct human erythroblasts, representing the last four cell divisions before enucleation. In this unique differentiation system, we found evidence of an extensive and dynamic alternative splicing program encompassing genes with many diverse functions. Alternative splicing was particularly enriched in genes controlling cell cycle, organelle organization, chromatin function and RNA processing. Many alternative exons exhibited differentiation-associated switches in splicing efficiency, mostly in late-stage polychromatophilic and orthochromatophilic erythroblasts, in concert with extensive cellular remodeling that precedes enucleation. A subset of alternative splicing switches introduces premature translation termination codons into selected transcripts in a differentiation stage-specific manner, supporting the hypothesis that alternative splicing-coupled nonsense-mediated decay contributes to regulation of erythroid-expressed genes as a novel part of the overall differentiation program. We conclude that a highly dynamic alternative splicing program in terminally differentiating erythroblasts plays a major role in regulating gene expression to ensure synthesis of appropriate proteome at each stage as the cells remodel in preparation for production of mature red cells.

TI To Be 'An Out-of-the-Synagoguer'
SO JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF THE NEW TESTAMENT
AB Since J. Louis Martyn proposed that John reflected a two-level drama, there has been much criticism of his (anachronistic?) use of the Birkat Ha-Minim to explain the expulsion of Christians from the synagogue. Adele Reinhartz maintains that this is really a case of anti-synagogue propaganda on the part of the evangelist. Yet, in all the exegetical discussion, one aspect which is rarely examined is the nominal form of ?pi omicron sigma upsilon nu alpha gamma omega gamma omicron sigma (Jn 9.22; 12.42; 16.2a), a strange term which Bible translations have to turn into a verb. This label appears to come from a Greek-speaking Jewish milieu, and its negativity is re-appropriated by the author of this Christian text. Social identity research provides an insight into how a positive approach to stigmatizing labels can allow a community to thrive. This can be applied to ?pi omicron sigma upsilon nu alpha gamma omega gamma omicron sigma in John, an insult which actually demonstrates the validity of one's faith and identity. It is good to be a reject.

TI The first analysis of Trichinella spiralis and Trichinella britovi adult
   worm excretory-secretory proteins by two-dimensional electrophoresis
   coupled with LC-MS/MS
SO VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY
AB The two most common Trichinella species present in European countries are Trichinella spiralis and Trichinella britovi. The consumption of raw or undercooked meat with invasive larvae results in trichinellosis. Currently, the most commonly used sources for detecting specific anti-Trichinella antibodies is ELISA with the muscle larvae (ML) excretory-secretory (E-S) proteins. However, these serological methods cannot be efficiently applied at early stage of infection. The aim of the current study was to identify the common and species-specific E-S proteins of T. spiralis and T. britovi adult worms which could have potential for accurate diagnosis of Trichinella infection at an early stage of invasion. Different sets of immunoreactive proteins were identified in T. spiralis and T. britovi proteomes by a combination of two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE), immunoblot and LC-MS/MS analysis. Polyubiquitin-B, a possible enoyl-CoA hydratase/isomerase YngF or polyubiquitin-like protein was found to be common for both species; gene ontology analysis confirmed its involvement in proteolysis, oxidation-reduction and translation processes, as well as in molecular transport. These molecules, being secreted or excreted at an early stage of parasite development, may play a critical role in the processes occurring during the initial steps of the host invasion and hence be suitable for diagnostic test development.

SO GENE
AB Stem-loop binding protein (SLBP) binds a stem-loop structure of the mRNA, which is important for the stability of histone mRNAs and translation process. In the present study, two slbp cDNAs (Ecslbpl and Ecslbp2) were cloned from a protogynous hermaphroditic orange-spotted grouper, Epinephelus coioides. Ecslbpl cDNA contained a 678 base pair (bp) open reading frame (ORF), encoding a predicted polypeptide of 225 amino acids. Ecslbp2 cDNA contained a 1041 bp, encoding a predicted protein of 346 amino acids. The result of real-time PCR revealed that Ecslbpl mRNA was exclusively detected in the ovary. Moreover, it was found to be restricted to oocytes according to in situ hybridization (ISH) analysis. Ecslbpl was found to be hardly detected in gonia and significantly increase in the cytoplasm of primary-growth stage oocytes, but decreased during the process of vitellogenesis. Interestingly, Ecslbp2 expression centralized as a perinuclear speckle in early-primary-growth stage oocytes, which appeared to form into the Balbiani body (Bb) in late-primary-growth stage oocytes. These data indicated that Ecslbp2 might play an important role in the process of oocyte development, and could serve as an oocyte-specific molecular marker for the study of ovary development and sex reversal in groupers.

TI EEF1D overexpression promotes osteosarcoma cell proliferation by
   facilitating Akt-mTOR and Akt-bad signaling
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH
AB Background: Dysregulation of eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 delta (EEF1D) in cancers has been reported; however, the role and mechanisms of EEF1D in osteosarcoma remain poorly understood. The aim of this study is to investigate the expression and role of EEF1D in osteosarcoma and to elucidate its underlying mechanisms.
   Methods: The expression of EEF1D in osteosarcomas and cell lines was evaluated by qRT-PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. EEF1D knockdown using small interfering RNA (siRNA) was employed to analyze the role of EEF1D in osteosarcoma cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. The host signaling pathways affected by EEF1D knockdown were detected using PathScan (R) intracellular signaling array kit.
   Results: The expression of EEF1D was found to be up-regulated in human osteosarcoma tissues and cell lines. Its expression was positively correlated with Enneking stage and the tumor recurrence. EEF1D knockdown inhibited osteosarcoma cell proliferation, colony-forming ability, and cell cycle G2/M transition in vitro. In addition, EEF1D knockdown decreased the levels of phospho-Akt, phospho-mTOR, and phospho-Bad proteins.
   Conclusions: EEF1D is upregulated in osteosarcoma and plays a tumor promoting role by facilitating Akt-mTOR and Akt-Bad signaling pathways. Accordingly, EEF1D is a potential target for cancer therapy.

TI Diversification of piRNAs expressed in PGCs and somatic cells during
   embryonic gonadal development
SO RNA BIOLOGY
AB piRNAs are small non-coding RNAs known to play a main role in defence against transposable elements in germ cells. However, other potential functions, such as biogenesis and differences in somatic and germline expression of these regulatory elements, are not yet fully unravelled. Here, we analysed a variety of piRNA sequences detected in mouse male and female primordial germ cells (PGCs) and gonadal somatic cells at crucial stages during embryonic differentiation of germ cells (11.5-13.5 days post-coitum). NGS of sncRNA and bioinformatic characterization of piRNAs from PGCs and somatic cells, in addition to piRNAs associated with TEs, indicated functional diversification in both cell types. Differences in the proportion of the diverse types of piRNAs are detected between somatic and germline during development. However, the global diversified patterns of piRNA expression are mainly shared between germ and somatic cells, we identified piRNAs related with molecules involved in ribosome components and translation pathway, including piRNAs derived from rRNA (34%), tRNA (10%) and snoRNA (8%). piRNAs from both tRNA and snoRNA are mainly derived from 3' and 5' end regions. These connections between piRNAs and rRNAs, tRNAs or snoRNAs suggest important functions of specialized piRNAs in translation regulation during this window of gonadal development.

TI eIF3f depletion impedes mouse embryonic development, reduces adult
   skeletal muscle mass and amplifies muscle loss during disuse
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON
AB Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, subunit F (eIF3f), a component of eIF3 complex, plays an important role in protein synthesis regulation, although its physiological functions are unknown. We generated and analysed mice carrying a null mutation in the eIF3f gene. We showed that homozygous eIF3f knockout fail to develop and that eIF3f(-/-) embryos die at an early stage of development but after the pre-implantation stage. However, disrupting one eIF3f allele does not affect growth, viability and fertility of heterozygous mice but, instead, reduces eIF3f mRNA and protein levels in all tissues examined. Although heterozygous mice are phenotypically indistinguishable from wild-type mice, they present a diminished body weight and a lean mass reduction associated with normal body size. Interestingly, skeletal muscles are mainly affected and display an altered cell size without modification of fibre number. Skeletal muscles of heterozygous mice show a deficiency in polysome content, a decrease in protein synthesis rate and an inhibition of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) pathway. We then studied the effects of hindlimb immobilization that mimic muscle disuse on heterozygous mice aiming to further explore the involvement of eIF3f in protein synthesis. We found that eIF3f partial depletion amplifies muscle atrophy compared to wild-type mice. Mass and cross-sectional area decreases were associated with reduced MTOR pathway activation and protein synthesis rate. Taken together, our data indicate that eIF3f is essential for mice embryonic development and controls adult skeletal muscle mass via protein synthesis regulation in a MTOR-dependent manner.

TI Chinese Chuanqi Opera in English: Directing The West Wing with Modern
   Music
SO ASIAN THEATRE JOURNAL
AB Part of a lab theatre experiment, this chuanqi opera production was an attempt to revive audience experience of the golden age of Chinese xiqu through text parallelism and music parallelism. Text parallelism requires the matching translation of the lingual features of a chuanqi text into its English double; such features include colloquial lexis, dense rhyming, language parallelism, and a measure of compensation in the adoptive language for the lost tonal patterns of the original. Music parallelism mimics the Ming China practice of employing music contemporary to the audience and composing the libretto to existing popular melodies.

TI Association between Circulation Indole-3-Acetic Acid Levels and Stem
   Cell Factor in Maintenance Hemodialysis Patients: A Cross-Sectional
   Study
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
AB Protein-bound uremic toxin is a cardiovascular (CV) risk factor for patients with end-stage renal disease. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) was found to be associated with CV disease but the detailed pathophysiology remains unknown. Moreover, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades play an important role in the pathogenesis of CV disease. Thus, we explored the association between circulating IAA levels and forty MAPK cascade associated proteins in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD). Circulating total form IAA was quantified by mass spectrometry and forty MAPK cascade associated proteins by a proximity extension assay in 331 prevalent HD patients. Accounting for multiple testing, and in multivariable-adjusted linear regression models, circulating total form IAA levels were positively associated with stem cell factor (beta coefficient 0.13, 95% confidence interval 0.04 to 0.21, p = 0.004). A bioinformatics approach using the search tool for interactions of chemicals (STITCH) tool provided information that IAA may be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, hematopoietic cells, and the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway. The knowledge gained here can be generalized, thereby impacting the non-traditional CV risk factors in patients with kidney disease. Further in vitro work is necessary to validate the translation of the mechanistic pathways.

TI Saint Elsewhere: German and English Reactions to Mendelssohn's Paulus
SO NINETEENTH CENTURY MUSIC
CT Biennial Meeting of the American-Bach-Society
CY MAY, 2008
CL Bethlehem, PA
SP Amer Bach Soc
AB This article examines German and English reactions to Felix Mendelssohn's 1836 oratorio, Paulus. German Protestant audiences recognized Paulus's devotional, or spiritual, quality, which derived from its incorporation of well-known Lutheran chorales. In using chorales and reflective arias and choruses, Mendelssohn followed the model established by Johann Sebastian Bach in his St. Matthew Passion, a work that Mendelssohn had reintroduced to German audiences in 1829. When Paulus was premiered for English audiences in a translation called St. Paul, it was enthusiastically received. But these audiences misunderstood St. Paul's devotional elements, for several reasons. Not only were English audiences unfamiliar with both Bach's music and the Lutheran chorale, they also expected oratorios to follow the model established by Handel. As such, English audiences were confused by those places in St. Paul where the present-day audience is called to reflect and attempted to attribute these numbers to characters in the drama. Mendelssohn responded to this confusion when writing his next oratorio, Elias ( or Elijah), in which he hewed more closely to the Handelian model.

TI Punctuation as Rhetorical Notation? From Colon to Semicolon
SO HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY
AB The word punctuation is not used in English until 1593. The earlier term, used from the late Middle Ages, was pointing, which meant a sign system for pausing in reading. This rhetorically based principle of punctuation continued to operate during the sixteenth century but was gradually superseded by the logical system, which mapped out the grammatical structure of a sentence. The punctuation mark that best typifies the earlier system is the colon, since this was used to identify the cola (members) of a periodic discourse and represented a mid-length pause. This essay will discuss different uses of the colon in a range of printed texts from the second half of the sixteenth century (psalms, hexameter verse, translations from Cicero, prose pamphlets, and drama). Neil Rhodes argues that the 1590s is the decade when the semicolon supersedes the colon in a move that encapsulates the broader transition from pointing to punctuation.

TI The Histone Deacetylase Gene Rpd3 Is Required for Starvation Stress
   Resistance
SO PLOS ONE
AB Epigenetic regulation in starvation is important but not fully understood yet. Here we identified the Rpd3 gene, a Drosophila homolog of histone deacetylase 1, as a critical epigenetic regulator for acquiring starvation stress resistance. Immunostaining analyses of Drosophila fat body revealed that the subcellular localization and levels of Rpd3 dynamically changed responding to starvation stress. In response to starvation stress, the level of Rpd3 rapidly increased, and it accumulated in the nucleolus in what appeared to be foci. These observations suggest that Rpd3 plays a role in regulation of rRNA synthesis in the nucleolus. The RT-qPCR and ChIP-qPCR analyses clarified that Rpd3 binds to the genomic region containing the rRNA promoters and activates rRNA synthesis in response to starvation stress. Polysome analyses revealed that the amount of polysomes was decreased in Rpd3 knockdown flies under starvation stress compared with the control flies. Since the autophagy-related proteins are known to be starvation stress tolerance proteins, we examined autophagy activity, and it was reduced in Rpd3 knockdown flies. Taken together, we conclude that Rpd3 accumulates in the nucleolus in the early stage of starvation, upregulates rRNA synthesis, maintains the polysome amount for translation, and finally increases stress tolerance proteins, such as autophagy-related proteins, to acquire starvation stress resistance.

TI Multimodality Imaging of Constrictive Pericarditis: Pathophysiology and

SO CURRENT CARDIOLOGY REPORTS
AB Purpose of Review The unique pathophysiological changes of constrictive pericarditis (CP) can now be identified with better imaging modalities, thereby helping in its early diagnosis. Through this review, we outline the pathophysiology of CP and its translation into symptomology and various imaging findings which then are used for both diagnosis and guiding treatment options for CP. Recent Findings Multimodality imaging has provided us with the capability to recognize early stages of the disease and identify patients with a potential for reversibility and can be treated with medical management. Additionally, peri-procedural planning and prediction of post-operative complications has been made possible with the use of advanced imaging techniques. Advanced imaging has the potential to play a greater role in identification of patients with reversible disease process and provide peri-procedural risk stratification, thereby improving outcomes for patients with CP.

TI Literacy and Awakening: The Awakening of 1804/1805 in Hopedale, Labrador
SO JOURNAL OF MORAVIAN HISTORY
AB This exploration of literacy and awakening draws attention to the fad that the learning of hymns and the translation of the Passion narrative of the Gospels were instrumental in the acceptance of the Moravian faith among the Labrador Inuit. Literacy, made possible through systematic schooling since 1780, was thus an important factor in the awakening of 1804/5 in Hopedale and contributed to the indigenization of Christianity in the eighteenth-century Moravian settlements of Nain, Okak, and Hopedale. During the awakening a significant shift occurred in the religious self-understanding of the Labrador Inuit when people moved from a relatively superficial understanding of Christianity as a remedy for personal lapses and violations to an existential understanding of the drama of sin and salvation as well as a deeper identification with the religious community. The study also points out the fad that communication through written epistles between Labrador and Greenland may have established a wider religious bond of solidarity between Greenland and Labrador Inuit and encouraged the Hopedale Inuit during their awakening.

TI G-quadruplex in animal development: Contribution to gene expression and

SO MECHANISMS OF DEVELOPMENT
AB During animal development, gene expression is orchestrated by specific and highly evolutionarily conserved mechanisms that take place accurately, both at spatial and temporal levels. The last decades have provided compelling evidence showing that chromatin state plays essential roles in orchestrating most of the stages of development. The DNA molecule can adopt alternative structures different from the helical duplex architecture. G-rich DNA sequences can fold as intrastrand quadruple helix structures called G-quadruplexes or G4-DNA. G4 can also be formed in RNA molecules, such as mRNA, lncRNA and pre-miRNA. Emerging evidences suggest that G4s have crucial roles in a variety of biological processes, including transcription, recombination, replication, translation and chromosome stability. In this review, we have collected recent information gathered by various laboratories showing the important role of G4 DNA and RNA structures in several steps of animal development.

TI N-6-Methyladenosine (m(6)A) readers are dysregulated in renal cell
   carcinoma
SO MOLECULAR CARCINOGENESIS
AB N-6-Methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most common modification of messenger RNA (mRNA) in mammals. It critically influences RNA metabolism and plays an essential role in virtually all types of bioprocesses including gene expression, tissue development, self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells, stress response and circadian clock control. It plays a crucial role in carcinogenesis and could be used as a prognostic and a diagnostic tool and as a target for new anticancer therapies. m(6)A modification is dynamically and reversibly regulated by three types of proteins. Methyltransferases, so-called "writers" add a methyl group to the adenosine, which can be removed by demethylases, also called "erasers." m(6)A-specific RNA-binding proteins, from here on referred to as "readers," preferentially bind to the m(6)A site and mediate biological functions, such as translation, splicing or decay of RNA. In this study, we examined the expression of the six m(6)A readers HNRNPA2B1, HNRNPC, YTHDC1 and YTHDF1-3 in clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC). We show that on mRNA level the expression of all six m(6)A readers is significantly downregulated compared to normal renal tissue and on protein level five out of six readers are dysregulated. Lower levels of some m(6)A readers are correlated with advanced stage and grade as well as associated with a shorter overall, progression-free and cancer-specific survival. In summary, we could show that m(6)A readers are dysregulated in ccRCC and might therefore act as a tumor marker, could give further information on the individual prognosis and be a target of innovative cancer therapy.

TI Dynamic expression of miRNAs and functional analysis of target genes
   involved in the response to male sterility of the wheat line YS3038
SO PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Thermosensitive cytoplasmic male sterile (TCMS) lines play an important role in wheat breeding, heterosis utilization, and germplasm innovation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can regulate the expression level of target genes by inhibiting the translation of these genes. YS3038 is a wheat TCMS line. In this study, the fertility conversion mechanism of YS3038 was studied by examining the abortion characteristics of YS3038, the regulation pattern of miRNAs and the target genes of miRNAs in YS3038. MiRNA-seq was performed on three important stages of YS3038 under sterile and fertile conditions. Then, the clean reads were aligned with some databases to filter other ncRNAs and repeats. The known miRNAs and novel miRNAs were predicted by sequence comparison with known miRNAs from miRbase. Differential expression of miRNAs between different stages and between different fertile conditions was analyzed, and functional analysis of target genes with opposite expression patterns as those of the miRNAs was conducted. The Ubisch bodies and microspores of sterile anthers were covered with filamentous materials. The degradation of the tapetum cells, the chloroplast structure of endothecium cells, and the microspore structure were abnormal. Microspore development was hindered from the late uninucleate stage to the binucleate stage. Twenty, 52, and 68 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRs) were identified at the early uninucleate, late uninucleate, and binucleate stages, respectively, and there were 0, 7, and 72 differentially expressed target genes (DETGs), respectively, at these three stages. At the binucleate stage, 29 DEmiRs had 41 target mRNAs in total, and the expression patterns of the 41 target mRNAs were opposite to those of the 29 miRNAs. Fifteen significantly enriched KEGG pathways were associated with the 41 target mRNAs. Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) play important roles in plant developmental and physiological processes. Some studies have shown that the expression of LRR-RLKs is related to the differentiation of microsporocytes and tapetum cells and to male sterility. An LRR-RLK (TaeRPK) gene was silenced by the barley stripe mosaic virusinduced gene silencing (BSMV-VIGS) method, and the seed setting rates of the TaeRPK-silenced plants (3.51%) were significantly lower than those of the negative control plants (88.78%) (P < 0.01). Thus, the TaeRPK gene is likely to be involved in the fertility conversion of YS3038.

TI Integrated mRNA and Small RNA Sequencing Reveals Regulatory Expression
   of Larval Metamorphosis of the Razor Clam
SO MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB The razor clam,Sinonovacula constricta, is an important economic marine shellfish, and its larval development involves obvious morphological and physiological changes. MicroRNA plays a key role in the physiological changes of the organism through regulating targeted mRNA. This study performed miRNA-mRNA sequencing for eight different developmental stages ofS. constrictausing Illumina sequencing. A total of 2156 miRNAs were obtained, including 2069 known miRNAs and 87 novel miRNAs. In addition, target genes were predicted for key miRNAs differentially expressed between adjacent development samples by integrating the mRNA transcriptome. Further analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes were enriched in complement activation, alternative pathways, translation, and negative regulation of monocyte molecular protein-1 production. KEGG pathway annotation showed significant enrichment in the regulation of the ribosome, phagosome, tuberculosis and fluid shear stress, and atherosclerosis. Ten mRNAs and ten miRNAs that are related to larval metamorphosis were identified using real-time PCR. Furthermore, the double luciferase experiment validated the negative regulatory relationship between miR-133 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma). These results indicated that the target genes regulated by these differentially expressed miRNAs may play an important regulatory role in the metamorphosis development ofS. constricta.

TI Teaching Latin American Migrations Through Theater
SO LATIN AMERICAN THEATRE REVIEW
AB The concept of migration offers a useful organizing principle for an introduction to Latin American theatre, as it encompasses multiple theatre styles and practices. Issues of migration are often in the news (in Latin America and beyond), thereby offering a point of entry for students who may not have studied theatre in the past. Migration in its multiple forms (immigration, emigration, exile, return) has a long history in the theatres of the Americas, including not only contemporary plays set on the US-Mexico border, but also Puerto Rican and Argentine theatre from the first half of the twentieth century and recent theatre from Ecuador, Chile, and Argentina. As a liminal space, the stage offers unique possibilities for the representation of migration. Theatre is a privileged space for the consideration of the migrant's experience of displacement, an intrinsically provisional space, continually redefined. Theatrical techniques used to evoke the displacements of immigration, exile, and return include: narrative and temporal disruption; multiple characters played by a single actor; the mixing of languages, with and without translation; the evocation of the absent or the disappeared; and satirical or grotesque exaggeration.

The essay suggests that answers to the philosophical questions asked by her 2015 film debut second coming - questions about time, embodiment, and intersubjectivity - may be found in ear for eye, a piece tucker green first wrote and directed as a play at the Royal Court in 2018, and subsequently adapted and directed for the cinema (2021). Each work, I argue, illuminates the other; reading them together reveals how they share a common and urgent interest in the form and performance of silence, as an inscription of negative agency and resistance. These pieces exist in a dialogical relationship with dominant traditions of performance practice. Indeed, the mercurial interplay of encounter and utterance defines tucker green's interest in radical staging, in the intermediations and translations of adaptation, and in questions of how form and convention intersect with race and identity.

TI Randomly translational activation inspired by the input distributions of
   ReLU
SO NEUROCOMPUTING
AB Deep convolutional neural networks have achieved great success on many visual tasks (e.g., image classification). Non-linear activation plays a very important role in deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). It is found that the input distribution of non-linear activation is like Gaussian distribution and the most of the inputs are concentrated near zero. It makes the learned CNN likely sensitive to the small jitter of the non-linear activation input. Meanwhile, CNN is easily prone to overfitting with deep architecture. To solve the above problems, we make full use of the input distributions of non-linear activation and propose the randomly translational non-linear activation for deep CNN. In the training stage, non-linear activation function is randomly translated by an offset sampled from Gaussian distribution. In the test stage, the non-linear activation with zero offset is used. Based on our proposed method, the input distribution of non-linear activation is relatively scattered. As the result, the learned CNN is robust to the small jitter of the non-linear activation input. Our proposed method can be also seen as the regularization of non-linear activation to reduce overfitting. Compared to the original non-linear activation, our proposed method can improve classification accuracy without increasing computation cost. Experimental results on CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. For example, the reductions of error rates with VGG architecture on CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100 are 0.55% and 1.61%, respectively. Even when the noise is added to the input image, our proposed method still has much better classification accuracy on CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Erythrocyte-derived drug delivery systems in cancer therapy
SO CHINESE CHEMICAL LETTERS
AB As natural blood components, erythrocytes were good candidates for being used as drug delivery systems to improve the pharmacokinetics, biocompatibility and many other aspects of different drugs. The advantages brought by erythrocytes making erythrocyte-derived drug delivery systems, also known as erythrocyte carriers, suitable for various anti-cancer agents, especially newly invented agents like nanoparticles, which were characterized by their undesired systematic toxicity, anaphylactic reactions and poor biocompatibility. Current researches on erythrocyte carriers in cancer therapy showed inspiring results in four major aspects: cancer enzyme therapy, delivering chemotherapeutic agents, combining with nanoparticles, and several other anti-cancer agents for gene or immune therapy. This novel delivering system was now undergoing the translation process from laboratory to clinical practice. Erythrocyte carriers for cancer enzyme therapy have entered the stage of clinical trial and have showed promising outcomes, and others were still at pre-clinical stage. In summary, erythrocyte-derived drug delivery system might play an indispensable role in the management of cancer in the future.

TI How Does the Design Guidelines for Traditional Cultural Artefacts
   Inspire Design in a Culturally Inspired Design Process? A Comparative
   Study with Novice Design Students
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION
AB Design guidelines for traditional cultural artefacts play an important role in Culturally Inspired Design (CID) activities and design education. In this paper, a comparative study was performed to assess the impact of present-day design guidelines for traditional Chinese cultural artefacts on novice designers in a CID process. In all, 42 novice designers enrolled in a cultural product design course participated in this study, under two different design conditions: an unaided condition and a guideline-aided condition. Each condition includes three stages: identification stage, translation stage and implementation stage. In the unaided condition, each participant was asked to finish an investigative report on traditional cultural artefacts without any guidance and then carry out a detailed cultural product design. These results were then compared with those of the participants in the guideline-aided condition, who received a design guideline for traditional cultural artefacts. The results were assessed by expert raters against six design metrics: breadth, depth, quantity, variety, novelty and quality. They revealed that the design guideline for traditional cultural artefacts in a CID process promoted the analysis of cultural features and increased the novelty and quality of design outcomes but resulted in decreased variety. We propose that the design guideline for traditional cultural artefacts may be useful as part of the design process and as a pedagogical tool in cultural creative design, but the best moment at which to introduce the design guideline should be further examined.

TI Developmental and Activity-Dependent miRNA Expression Profiling in
   Primary Hippocampal Neuron Cultures
SO PLOS ONE
AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionarily conserved non-coding RNAs of similar to 22 nucleotides that regulate gene expression at the level of translation and play vital roles in hippocampal neuron development, function and plasticity. Here, we performed a systematic and in-depth analysis of miRNA expression profiles in cultured hippocampal neurons during development and after induction of neuronal activity. MiRNA profiling of primary hippocampal cultures was carried out using locked nucleic-acid-based miRNA arrays. The expression of 264 different miRNAs was tested in young neurons, at various developmental stages (stage 2-4) and in mature fully differentiated neurons (stage 5) following the induction of neuronal activity using chemical stimulation protocols. We identified 210 miRNAs in mature hippocampal neurons; the expression of most neuronal miRNAs is low at early stages of development and steadily increases during neuronal differentiation. We found a specific subset of 14 miRNAs with reduced expression at stage 3 and showed that sustained expression of these miRNAs stimulates axonal outgrowth. Expression profiling following induction of neuronal activity demonstrates that 51 miRNAs, including miR-134, miR-146, miR-181, miR-185, miR-191 and miR-200a show altered patterns of expression after NMDA receptor-dependent plasticity, and 31 miRNAs, including miR-107, miR-134, miR-470 and miR-546 were upregulated by homeostatic plasticity protocols. Our results indicate that specific miRNA expression profiles correlate with changes in neuronal development and neuronal activity. Identification and characterization of miRNA targets may further elucidate translational control mechanisms involved in hippocampal development, differentiation and activity-depended processes.

TI Bug22 influences cilium morphology and the post-translational
   modification of ciliary microtubules
SO BIOLOGY OPEN
AB Cilia and flagella are organelles essential for motility and sensing of environmental stimuli. Depending on the cell type, cilia acquire a defined set of functions and, accordingly, are built with an appropriate length and molecular composition. Several ciliary proteins display a high degree of conservation throughout evolution and mutations in ciliary genes are associated with various diseases such as ciliopathies and infertility. Here, we describe the role of the highly conserved ciliary protein, Bug22, in Drosophila. Previous studies in unicellular organisms have shown that Bug22 is required for proper cilia function, but its exact role in ciliogenesis has not been investigated yet. Null Bug22 mutant flies display cilia-associated phenotypes and nervous system defects. Furthermore, sperm differentiation is blocked at the individualization stage, due to impaired migration of the individualization machinery. Tubulin post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as polyglycylation, polyglutamylation or acetylation, are determinants of microtubule (MT) functions and stability in centrioles, cilia and neurons. We found defects in the timely incorporation of polyglycylation in sperm axonemal MTs of Bug22 mutants. In addition, we found that depletion of human Bug22 in RPE1 cells resulted in the appearance of longer cilia and reduced axonemal polyglutamylation. Our work identifies Bug22 as a protein that plays a conserved role in the regulation of PTMs of the ciliary axoneme. (C) 2014. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

TI Colloquium: Hydrodynamics and holography of charge density wave phases
SO REVIEWS OF MODERN PHYSICS
AB The Colloquium reviews recent progress in the effective description of strongly correlated phases of matter with spontaneously broken translations, such as charge density waves or Wigner crystals. In real materials, disorder is inevitable and pins the Goldstones of broken translations. The Colloquium describes how pinning can be incorporated into the effective field theory at low energies without making any assumptions on the presence of boost symmetry. The essential role played by gaugegravity duality models in establishing these effective field theories with only approximate symmetries is reviewed. The Colloquium closes with a discussion on the relevance of these models to the phenomenology of dc and ac transport in strongly correlated strange and bad metals, such as high-temperature superconductors.

TI beta 2-adrenergic receptor signaling promotes pancreatic ductal
   adenocarcinoma (PDAC) progression through facilitating PCBP2-dependent
   c-myc expression
SO CANCER LETTERS
AB The beta 2-adrenergic receptor (beta 2-AR) plays a crucial role in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) progression. In this report, we identified poly(rC)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2) as a novel binding partner for beta 2-AR using immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) approach. The association between beta 2-AR and PCBP2 was verified using reciprocal immunoprecipitation. Importantly, we found significant interaction and co-localization of the two proteins in the presence of beta 2-AR agonist in Panc-1 and Bxpc3 PDAC cells. beta 2-AR-induced recruitment of PCBP2 led to augmented protein level of c-myc in PDAC cells, likely as a result of enhanced internal ribosome entry segment (IRES)-mediated translation of c-myc. The activation of beta 2-AR accelerated cell proliferation and colony formation, while knockdown of PCBP2 or c-myc restrained the effect. Furthermore, overexpression of PCBP2 was observed in human PDAC cell lines and tissue specimens compared to the normal pancreatic ductal epithelial cells and the non-cancerous tissues respectively. Overexpression of beta 2-AR and PCBP2 was associated with advanced tumor stage and significantly worsened prognosis in patients with PDAC. Our results elucidate a new molecular mechanism by which beta 2-AR signaling facilitates PDAC progression through triggering PCBP2-dependent c-myc expression. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

TI Expression of aquaporin 8 and phosphorylation of Erk1/2 in cervical
   epithelial carcinogenesis: correlation with clinicopathological
   parameters
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PATHOLOGY
AB Overexpression of aquaporins (AQPs) has been reported in several human cancers. Extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (Erk1/2) are associated with tumorigenesis and cancer progression and may upregulate AQPs expression. In this study, we examined cervical tissue samples to establish the relationship between Erk1/2 and AQPs in cervical carcinoma by RT-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry. We also examined the relationship between AQP8, Erk1/2 and clinicopathological variables in patients with cervical cancer. Our results showed that Erk1/2 was differentially expressed at the level of transcription and was most highly expressed in CIN samples (P < 0.05). At the level of translation, significant differences were seen in the expression of AQP8, Erk1/2 and PErk1/2 (P < 0.05). Expression was highest in CIN samples, where 80.9%, 76.6%, and 66% of samples were positive for AQP8, Erk1/2 and P-Erk1/2, respectively. Expression in cervical carcinoma samples was higher than in normal cervical tissues (P < 0.01). AQP8 expression was associated with the depth of invasion of cervical cancer cells, and the expression of Erk1/2 and P-Erk1/2 was increased in earlier clinical stages and in lymphatic metastasis. AQP8 expression was positively correlated with Erk1/2 expression in cervical cancer. In conclusions, increased AQP8, Erk1/2 and P-Erk1/2 expression may play a role in transformation of CIN into cervical cancer, and in early invasion and lymphatic metastasis of cervical cancer. These proteins could potentially be used as molecular markers for early diagnosis of cervical carcinoma.

TI RECEPTION OF AUSTRIAN EXPRESSIONISM IN CZECH POETRY
SO KNJIZEVNA SMOTRA
AB The Austrian expressionist poet Georg Trakl (1887-1914) had a significant influence on the twentieth-century Czech literature, especially thanks to the early translations of his poetry into Czech by Bohuslav Reynek (1917 and 1924) and later by Ludvik Kundera (1965 and 1995). Numerous translators and poets dealt with Trakl's poetry. At the center of the inquiry is the question of the dissemination of this influence among the Moravian poets - in whose poems and in what way Trakl's work finds its reflection. In the early 1930s collections of young Moravian poets appeared that responded to the previous literary era of poetism, which was characterized by carefree and optimistic worldview. For these poets - Frantipek Halas, Vilem Zavada and Jan ZahradniEek - the motifs of autumn, mourning and death were of great importance. These poets had either a direct or indirect effect (mediated by Bohuslav Reynek's translations) of Trakl's work - similar motifs of doom appear, the same ghostly atmosphere and sometimes literal quotations. Trakl's strongest influence on Czech literature can be found in the second collection of poetry by Frantipek Halas Kohout plapi smrt (The Rooster Shuns Death, 1930). Even in the 1960s, one still speaks of a "traditional atmosphere", such as B. in the book of poems MetliEky (The Rods, 1968) by Jan Skacel. The drama Trakl (from 1998, realized as a radio play in 2002) by the young playwright Marek HoropEak has a special position. It turns out that Trakl's work has a firm place in Czech literature and still radiates to the present day.

TI Identification and expression patterns of 20-hydroxyecdysone-responsive
   genes from Procambarus clarkii
SO GENES & GENOMICS
AB Ecdysteroids play an important role in the regulation of molting process in crustaceans. The suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) technique was employed to search for 20-hydroxyecdysone-responsive genes in the hepatopancreas of the crayfish Procambarus clarkii. Ninety-three putative expressed sequence tags were identified by SSH, including three immune response-related genes, two cell cycle and apoptosis genes, four respiration and energy metabolism genes, four transport-related genes, six metabolism-related genes, two stress response genes, and eight transcription and translation regulation genes. The expression levels of the examined genes were regulated by 20-hydroxyecdysone and varied in the hepatopancreas during the molting stages; data were confirmed by real-time PCR. RNAi of the ecdysteroid receptor had significant effects on the expression levels of 20-hydroxyecdysone-responsive genes. These differentially expressed genes identified by SSH will provide insight into the ecdysteroid signaling pathway in P. clarkii.

TI Der deutschsprachige Berger Extravagant
SO GERMANISCH-ROMANISCHE MONATSSCHRIFT
AB As a genre of highly formal pattern, pastoral poetry evoked satire. Charles Sorel's Le Berger extravagant and its dramatic transformation by Thomas Corneille soon found its way into German literature. Harsdorffer (1647) presented the mad shepherd, who mingled literature with life as an example of the folly of this world. Rist amalgamated him with the "boisterous soldier," using him as a comic figure (1653). Gryphius' translation of Corneille's humorous play was performed at the Silesian court (1661). The interconnection between the pastoral genre with music and its affinity to courtly entertainment proved true in Ming and Sebastiani's opera for a noble wedding in Konigsberg a rare and very early example of this genre. Emperor Leopold I himself composed the music in Vienna (1683) for an adaptation of the plot. It was not until 1717 that Gryphius' text was staged again, this time for a courtly celebration in Blankenburg.

TI Non-subsampled contourlet transform based image denoising in ultrasound
   thyroid images using adaptive binary morphological operations
SO IET COMPUTER VISION
AB Speckle noise reduction is an important preprocessing stage for ultrasound medical image processing. In this paper, a despeckling algorithm is proposed based on non-subsampled contourlet transform. This transform has the property of high directionality, anisotropy and translation invariance, which can be controlled by non-subsampled filter banks. This study aims to denoise the speckle noise in ultrasound images using adaptive binary morphological operations, in order to preserve edges, contours and textures. In morphological operations, structural element plays an important role for image enhancement. In this work, different shapes of structural element have been analysed and filtering parameters have been changed adaptively depending on the nature of the image and the amount of noise in the image. Experimental results of proposed method for natural images, Field II simulated images and real ultrasound images, show that the proposed method is able to preserve edges and image structural details compared with existing methods.

TI "FISH AND TREES ARE ALIKE": THE MOVEMENT OF IDENTITY IN KIRMEN URIBE'S
   BILBAO-NEW YORK-BILBAO
SO HISPANIC REVIEW
AB This article explores the role translation has played in the circulation and promotion of Basque writer Kirmen Uribe's first novel Bilbao-New York-Bilbao (2008). By examining the response both in and outside of the Basque Country, the article shows how particular views of literature within the Basque Country have influenced the work's reception. In particular, drawing from political theories on community formation, it highlights the way art and literature are represented in the novel as spaces in which Basque artist-citizens have the right to participate in the nonviolent creation of their collective reality and to exchange and inspire ideas on the global stage. The article argues that Uribe's novel promotes a productive view of Basque identity as always in movement, and therefore it is not exclusively tied to previous generations and their more violent means of protecting Basque culture.

TI Cancer biomarker discovery and validation
SO TRANSLATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH
AB With the emergence of genomic profiling technologies and selective molecular targeted therapies, biomarkers play an increasingly important role in the clinical management of cancer patients. Single gene/ protein or multi-gene "signature"-based assays have been introduced to measure specific molecular pathway deregulations that guide therapeutic decision-making as predictive biomarkers. Genome-based prognostic biomarkers are also available for several cancer types for potential incorporation into clinical prognostic staging systems or practice guidelines. However, there is still a large gap between initial biomarker discovery studies and their clinical translation due to the challenges in the process of cancer biomarker development. In this review we summarize the steps of biomarker development, highlight key issues in successful validation and implementation, and overview representative examples in the oncology field. We also discuss regulatory issues and future perspectives in the era of big data analysis and precision medicine.

TI Genome-wide analysis of microRNA156 and its targets, the genes encoding
   SQUAMOSA promoter-binding protein-like (SPL) transcription factors, in
   the grass family Poaceae
SO JOURNAL OF ZHEJIANG UNIVERSITY-SCIENCE B
AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that play an important role in post-transcriptional gene regulation in plants and animals by targeting messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for cleavage or repressing translation of specific mRNAs. The first miRNA identified in plants, miRNA156 (miR156), targets the SQUAMOSA promoter-binding protein-like (SPL) transcription factors, which play critical roles in plant phase transition, flower and plant architecture, and fruit development. We identified multiple copies of MIR156 and SPL in the rice, Brachypodium, sorghum, maize, and foxtail millet genomes. Sequence and chromosomal synteny analysis showed that both MIR156s and SPLs are conserved across species in the grass family. Analysis of expression data of the SPLs in eleven juvenile and adult rice tissues revealed that four non-miR156-targeted genes were highly expressed and three miR156-targeted genes were only slightly expressed in all tissues/developmental stages. The remaining SPLs were highly expressed in the juvenile stage, but their expression was lower in the adult stage. It has been proposed that under strong selective pressure, non-miR156-targeted mRNA may be able to re-structure to form a miRNA-responsive element. In our analysis, some non-miR156-targeted SPLs (SPL5/8/10) had gene structure and gene expression patterns similar to those of miR156-targeted genes, suggesting that they could diversify into miR156-targeted genes. DNA methylation profiles of SPLs and MIR156s in different rice tissues showed diverse methylation patterns, and hypomethylation of non-CG sites was observed in rice endosperm. Our findings suggested that MIR156s and SPLs had different origination and evolutionary mechanisms: the SPLs appear to have resulted from vertical evolution, whereas MIR156s appear to have resulted from strong evolutionary selection on mature sequences.

TI NITRIC OXIDE, NORMAL SCIENCE, AND LESSONS LEARNED BY A MARGINALLY
   PREPARED MIND
SO PERSPECTIVES IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
AB The discovery in the late 1970s that the vascular endothelium plays a major role in regulating the caliber of blood vessels caused a minor paradigm shift in thinking about the cardiovascular system. That the gas nitric oxide (NO) was central to this discovery was unexpected and set the stage for a broader series of insights related to gaseous signaling molecules in biological systems. Over the last 25 years, the author's lab has attempted to understand what NO does in alive, awake, exercising humans. This article recounts six lessons learned along the way, about luck, reductionism, and the translation of biomedical discoveries to therapy, as well as about philosophical questions related to big versus small science and curiosity-driven versus goal-directed approaches. The article also poses a fundamental question: would NO in specific and gaseous signaling molecules more generally have been discovered by sequencing, Big Data, and hypothesis-free science?

TI Therapeutic Potential of PI3K/AKT/mTOR Pathway in Gastrointestinal
   Stromal Tumors: Rationale and Progress
SO CANCERS
AB Simple Summary
   Most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) arise due to gain-of-function mutations of KIT and PDGFRA, encoding the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). The introduction of the RTK inhibitor imatinib has significantly improved the management of GISTs; however, drug resistance remains a challenge. Constitutive autophosphorylation of RTKs is associated with the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Especially, this pathway plays a pivotal role in mRNA translation initiation, directly regulated by eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs). This review highlights the progress for targeting PI3K/AKT/mTOR-dependent mechanisms in GISTs and explores the relationship between mTOR downstream eIFs and the development of GISTs, which may be a promising future therapeutic target for this tumor entity.
   Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) originates from interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) in the myenteric plexus of the gastrointestinal tract. Most GISTs arise due to mutations of KIT and PDGFRA gene activation, encoding the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). The clinical use of the RTK inhibitor imatinib has significantly improved the management of GIST patients; however, imatinib resistance remains a challenge. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is a critical survival pathway for cell proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy and translation in neoplasms. Constitutive autophosphorylation of RTKs has an impact on the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. In several preclinical and early-stage clinical trials PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling inhibition has been considered as a promising targeted therapy strategy for GISTs. Various inhibitory drugs targeting different parts of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway are currently being investigated in phase Iota and phase Iota Iota clinical trials. This review highlights the progress for PI3K/AKT/mTOR-dependent mechanisms in GISTs, and explores the relationship between mTOR downstream signals, in particular, eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) and the development of GISTs, which may be instrumental for identifying novel therapeutic targets.

TI Molecular cloning and mRNA expression analysis of ornithine
   decarboxylase antizyme 2 in ovarian follicles of the Sichuan white goose
   (Anser cygnoides)
SO GENE
AB The ornithine decarboxylase antizyme 2 (OAZ2) gene is a member of the antizyme gene family. Antizymes play pivotal roles in various cellular pathways, induding polyamine anabolism and apoptosis. The molecular structure and expression profile of the OAZ2 in goose ovarian follicles have not been reported. In this study, the OAZ2 cDNA sequence of the Sichuan white goose was cloned (Anser cygnoides), and phylogenetic and structural analyses of the OAZ2 were performed. The expression profiling of OAZ2 mRNA in goose ovarian follicles was examined using quantitative real-time PCR. The sequence analysis showed that the 756 bp OAZ2 sequence contained two overlapping open reading frames (ORF). ORF1 was 99 bp in length, and encoded a 32 aa polypeptide. ORF2 was 477 bp in length, and encoded a 158 aa polypeptide. The frameshift site that initiates the translation of ORF2 was located at nucleotide position 97 in the OAZ2. The analysis of OAZ2 mRNA expression in hierarchical follicles showed that the level of OAZ2 mRNA was higher in the SWF and F2 follicular stages than that in the ovarian stroma (P < 0.05). The lowest level of OAZ2 expression was detected in the ovarian stroma. These results suggest that the highly conserved frameshift region plays an important role in sustaining the function of OAZs. Furthermore, the significantly higher level of OAZ2 mRNA in the SWF stage indicates that OAZ2 may be involved in recruiting hierarchical follicles. Our results also suggest that OAZ2 may augment the effects of OAZ1 in follicle development. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Research on the circadian clock gene HNF4a in different malignant tumors
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES
AB Background: The circadian rhythm is produced by multiple feedback loops formed by the core clock genes after transcription and translation, thus regulating various metabolic and physiological functions of the human body. We have shown previously that the abnormal expression of 14 clock genes is related closely to the occurrence and development of different malignant tumors, and these genes may play an anti-cancer or pro-cancer role in different tumors. HNF4a has many typical properties of clock proteins involved in the clock gene negative feedback loop regulation process. We need to explore the function of HNF4a as a circadian clock gene in malignant tumors further. Methods: We used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to download the clinicopathological information of twenty malignant tumors and the corresponding RNA-seq data. The HNF4a RNA-seq data standardized by R language and clinical information were integrated to reveal the relationship between HNF4a and prognosis of patients. Results: Analysis of TCGA data showed that the prognosis of HNF4a was significantly different in BLCA, KIRC, LUSC, and READ. High HNF4a expression is correlated with good prognosis in BLCA, KIRC, and READ but poor prognosis in LUSC. However, HNF4a was associated with the stages, T stages, and lymph node status only in BLCA. Conclusions: HNF4a plays different roles in different malignancies, and the abnormal expression of HNF4a has a great correlation with the biological characteristics of BLCA. The low expression of HNF4a could be a reference index for the metastasis, recurrence, and prognosis of BLCA.

TI The oncogenic and tumor suppressive roles of RNA-binding proteins in
   human cancers
SO JOURNAL OF CELLULAR PHYSIOLOGY
AB Posttranscriptional regulation is a mechanism for the cells to control gene regulation at the RNA level. In this process, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play central roles and orchestrate the function of RNA molecules in multiple steps. Accumulating evidence has shown that the aberrant regulation of RBPs makes contributions to the initiation and progression of tumorigenesis via numerous mechanisms such as genetic changes, epigenetic alterations, and noncoding RNA-mediated regulations. In this article, we review the effects caused by RBPs and their functional diversity in the malignant transformation of cancer cells that occurs through the involvement of these proteins in various stages of RNA regulation including alternative splicing, stability, polyadenylation, localization, and translation. Besides this, we review the various interactions between RBPs and other crucial posttranscriptional regulators such as microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs in the pathogenesis of cancer. Finally, we discuss the potential approaches for targeting RBPs in human cancers.

TI Fuzzy wavelet network based on extended Kalman filter training algorithm
   combined with least square weight estimation: Efficient and improved
   chromatographic QSRR/QSPR models
SO CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS
AB Inspired by the theory of multiresolution analysis (MRA) of wavelet transforms and fuzzy concepts, a fuzzy wavelet network (FWN) is proposed for predicting the gas chromatographic retention time of phenol derivatives on fused-silica, wide-bore, and open-tubular columns with different polarities in terms of quantitative structure-retention relationship (QSRR) studies. The FWN consists of a set of fuzzy rules. Each rule corresponding to a subwavelet neural network (WNN) consists of single-scaling wavelets. The proposed FWN follows a two-stage efficient learning algorithm scheme, which undertakes the extended Kalman filter (EKF) training algorithm for adjusting all translation parameters, dilation parameters, and weight coefficients of the WNNs and then least square estimation for updating all the weights. 4-3-1 FWNs were developed using the descriptors selected by the multiple linear regression (MLR) models as inputs. By learning the translation parameters of the wavelets and adjusting the shape of membership functions, the model accuracy was remarkably improved. The accuracy and robustness of the generated models were illustrated using leave-one-out and leave-multiple-out cross-validations and also by Y-randomization. Sensitivity analysis by sequential zeroing of weights revealed that the molecular geometry and electronic interactions play a major role in the retention behavior of these compounds on non-polar and semi-polar columns, respectively.

TI The Teaching of Interculturality through Literature: New Challenges
SO REVISTA ELECTRONICA INTERUNIVERSITARIA DE FORMACION DEL PROFESORADO
AB The teaching of literature in secondary schools in the Czech Republic (note that this is in the course of Czech literature courses and taught in Czech) contributes in a relevant way to open to young people new worlds. It works starting from the treasury of the world thought, Homer's Odyssey for example through Shakespearean drama and Goethe's Faust, to the novels by Balzac or by Zola, to the twentieth century authors who engaged in the humanist cause by unveiling the hidden facets of human existence. The purpose of our reflection on intercultural topics is first of all to analyze the contribution of reading to the level of knowledge, then to propose the possibilities of using literary texts to demonstrate how much the dialogue between cultures is included in the works themselves, and finally, to consider which contemporary literary texts on a world scale could enrich in a relevant way the choice of books recommended to young Czechs. The conclusion will be a synthesis trying to compare the situation of Czech students to that of young Frenchmen, for example. It will also highlight the role of translation not only in teaching literature, but in knowing the Other.

TI Narrativity discovered and narrativity uncovered: Narration and
   narrativisation in related political discourse
SO SLOVO A SLOVESNOST
AB This paper provides fresh insights about media representations of political debates as highly agonistic environments, and in addition about narratively related (reported) speech as a transformative technique favoured by journalists to report on televised political debates in the next day's newspaper. In doing so it also demonstrates a method (using the discourse analysis software Prospero) for detecting and analysing formulaic semantico-discursive phrases that recur in large textual corpuses. Following a theoretical approach rooted in the ideas of polyphony and narrativisation as an act of translation, it describes two formulas with a strong narrative and argumentative dimension, X udelal B, kdyz rekl A (In saying A, X did B) and Jak X rekl, ... (As X said, ...). I show how both are deployed to support the reporter's rendition of the debates as ongoing argumentative contests, the first to "uncover" the drama behind what was said, the second to project a mission or scenario "discovered" in the words of an authority. A reporter who uses the phrase In saying A, X did B is performing narrativisation, whereas one who uses the phrase As X said, ... is performing critical or apologetic co-narration.

TI "An Inert and Neutral State of Form": Zero-degree Writing, Photography,
   and Early Prose Narrative in French
SO EXEMPLARIA-MEDIEVAL EARLY MODERN THEORY
AB Part of my project on literary form in translation, this article stages a dialogue between, on the one hand, the formal and stylistic qualities of medieval literary French prose in the first half-century of its practice, and, on the other, Roland Barthes's essays on zero-degree writing and on photography. French literary prose, which came to the fore suddenly around 1200 ce, presents itself as an impoverished form of writing lacking the vividness and drama of the well-established verse narration. Why, then, did it enjoy international success? The same question may be asked of early photography, self-evidently so much poorer than painting. Barthes helps us to see how a deliberate "loss of color" helps to generate a new vision of the world - which, for early French prose, was linked to the idealism and violence of crusading. Conversely, reading the utopian Le Degre zero de l'ecriture and, especially, the melancholic La Chambre claire alongside medieval Grail romances helps us to see how the quest for an (envisaged or lost) ideal inspires both, and to understand the role of form and the impetus for renewal in Barthes's final published essay.

TI A systematic review of psychosocial interventions for child soldiers:
   types, length and main findings
SO JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WORK PRACTICE
AB This systematic review was carried out to identify and evaluate psychosocial intervention strategies and procedures addressed to child soldiers. Following an exploration of peer-reviewed articles published between 2004 and 2018 in the PILOTS, Psycnet, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, 28 of them were finally selected. The predominant theme was post-traumatic stress disorder. The intervention techniques used to deal with this and other problems consisted of established therapies (i.e. interpersonal psychotherapy, cognitive behavioural therapy), creative-expressive activities (such as dance, music and drama), and other activities promoting training and social interaction (skills training for leadership, self-regulation and reintegration). The cultural adaptation of the techniques and instruments used for intervention was limited to the translation of the instruments - but without verifying their comprehensibility in the majority of cases, which constitutes a problem when assessing the impact of the interventions carried out in the target population. Given that in most cases the results obtained from the interventions present limitations regarding their explanatory potential and generalisation, this review highlights aspects that can inform and improve psychosocial interventions and research geared towards the recovery of the collective of child soldiers.

TI Utopian Studies in Greece Today: A Brief Survey
SO UTOPIAN STUDIES
AB In the first section, this article offers a sketch of tendencies in the engagement with utopia and utopianism in contemporary Greece: after dwelling on Greek-language scholarly research and translation in the area of utopian studies, it makes reference to film, drama and performance art, architecture and urbanism, and cross-platform cultural initiatives. It concludes with two observations regarding the dominant character of the Greek reception of the utopian problematic in recent years: first, that it is highly political in nature and therefore oriented to concrete social and cultural interventions around the major issues the country has faced and, second, that the increasing resonance of utopia is for these reasons largely unofficial in character, since European research funding is relatively lacking. This gives a strongly "grassroots" character to much of the activity using utopia as method and orientation. The second half of the survey draws on responses to the journal questionnaire to document the activity of one research initiative undertaken in Greece, "Utopia Project 2006-2010," coordinated by Vassilis Vlastaras and Maria Glyka under the auspices of the Athens School of Fine Arts and involving the collaborative work of international artists and academics over a period of five years.

TI Development of a Laser-Based Geometric Imperfection Measurement Platform
   with Application to Cold-Formed Steel Construction
SO EXPERIMENTAL MECHANICS
AB Geometric imperfections play an important role in the strength and behavior of thinwalled metal parts such as those commonly used in cold-formed steel construction. The objective of this paper is to detail a newly developed imperfection measurement platform, where the full-three dimensional (3D) imperfect geometry of a cold-formed steel member can be measured and reconstructed with reasonably high throughput and sufficient accuracy to explore all relevant imperfections. The measurement platform is composed of a two-dimensional laser sensor mounted on rotary and linear stages. Specimens are placed within a rotary ring and along a reference beam. The linear stage provides a means to scan the length of the specimen and the rotary stage a means to scan from any angle. Control of the custom linear and rotary stages are detailed in the paper, and corresponding control accuracies are studied. A procedure for registering the individual scans into the complete 3D model reconstruction (point cloud) is provided by specific calibration tests, from which rotation and translation quantities can be found to transform surfaces measured in local coordinates to a universal global coordinate system. A variety of different imperfection quantities, from basic dimensions and out-of-plane deviations to more advanced spectral and modalbased imperfection magnitudes may be rapidly processed from the 3D model. Accurate understanding of geometric imperfections is critical to the long-term success of analysis-based design paradigms for cold-formed steel constructions. The apparatus detailed herein will be used to provide a broad suite of imperfection information to assist in these new efforts.

   (JANAM)
SO ASIAN THEATRE JOURNAL
AB The Delhi-based Jana Natya Manch, popularly known as JANAM, has been one of the most active street theatre groups in India since 1978. The group was commissioned to create DTC Ki Dhandhli (The Corrupt Trappings of DTC) in 1979 in response to a sudden bus fare hike by the Delhi Transport Corporation. The writing of the play was headed by Safdar Hashmi, one of the founders of the group. This short play, translated here for the first time, was instrumental in garnering public opinion against the financial mishandlings of the DTC. The outcry that the play inspired forced the DTC to roll back the fare revisions. The introduction preceding this translation contextualizes the events of the play and provides a basic introduction to JANAM. The Corrupt Trappings of DTC is one of the earliest plays from the group's repertoire. The short play introduces the reader to the ways in which this theatre group allied itself from its very early days with the everyday struggles of working-class people in the sprawling urban outgrowths surrounding the Indian capital.

Contrast agents have been used to improve sensitivity and specificity of CMR in detecting and evaluating various pathologies. Much effort has been made to develop more efficient contrast reagents to detect cardiovascular diseases at an asymptomatic stage, which has led to a plethora of products in animal studies. However, very few of the developed contrast agents are currently approved for human use. Major obstacles are high dosages, toxicity, body clearance rate and long-term immunogenicity. In this review, we critically assess recent developments in the field of the contrast agents for CMR, highlighting both benefits and current drawbacks. A clearer insight regarding the challenges facing the development of improved contrast agents may help collaborative work to enhance images contrast, decrease toxicity and accelerate their translation into clinical use.

TI Biogenesis, evolution and functional targets of microRNA-125a
SO MOLECULAR GENETICS AND GENOMICS
AB MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional level by inhibiting translation of complementary mRNAs and/or targeting them for degradation. MicroRNAs play crucial roles in development, cell differentiation, and apoptosis. In addition, recent studies indicate that they are important regulators of virus-host interactions. MicroRNA-125a is a homolog of C. elegans lin-4, the first discovered microRNA, shown to dictate the onset of larval stages in the nematode. In this review, we focus on the gene structure of microRNA-125a, its evolution, its expression pattern in mammalian organs and tissues, and its functional targets. Overall, the available data indicate that microRNA-125a plays crucial roles both in development and in the adult tissues. In fact, it (1) contributes to the control of phase transitions in development and/or cell differentiation; (2) regulates the expression of several target proteins that are involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration; (3) interferes with the expression of the hepatitis B virus surface antigen in liver cells, thus counteracting viral replication. These findings suggest that delivery of microRNA-125a mimics or treatments that modulate its cellular expression may be valuable tools for the development of new therapeutic strategies for human diseases, including cancer and viral hepatitis B.

TI Towards understanding particle rigid-body motion during solid-state
   sintering
SO JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN CERAMIC SOCIETY
AB A quantitative understanding of particle rigid body (RB) motion that inherently accompanies grain boundary (GB) diffusion is highly desirable to understand and control the dynamic interplay between coarsening and densification during solid state sintering. By computer simulation using a multi-phase-field approach, we analyze systematically the roles played by each of these processes at different stages of the shrinkage of the internal pore in a three-particle green body as a function of particle size as well as thermodynamic and kinetic factors of interfaces. We demonstrate that particle RB translation promotes both neck growth, and pore rounding and shrinkage. Moreover, the forces acting at GBs and pulling neighboring particles towards one another dynamically evolve as particles fuse. In contrast, particle RB rotation has no contribution to pore shrinkage. The translational force acting on an individual particle varies with not only its size, but also the number and sizes of its neighboring particles.

TI The emerging roles of NGS-based liquid biopsy in non-small cell lung
   cancer
SO JOURNAL OF HEMATOLOGY & ONCOLOGY
AB The treatment paradigm of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has evolved into oncogene-directed precision medicine. Identifying actionable genomic alterations is the initial step towards precision medicine. An important scientific progress in molecular profiling of NSCLC over the past decade is the shift from the traditional piecemeal fashion to massively parallel sequencing with the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS). Another technical advance is the development of liquid biopsy with great potential in providing a dynamic and comprehensive genomic profiling of NSCLC in a minimally invasive manner. The integration of NGS with liquid biopsy has been demonstrated to play emerging roles in genomic profiling of NSCLC by increasing evidences. This review summarized the potential applications of NGS-based liquid biopsy in the diagnosis and treatment of NSCLC including identifying actionable genomic alterations, tracking spatiotemporal tumor evolution, dynamically monitoring response and resistance to targeted therapies, and diagnostic value in early-stage NSCLC, and discussed emerging challenges to overcome in order to facilitate clinical translation in future.

TI The Transmediality of Anachronism: Reconsidering the Revolutionary
   Representations of Antiquity and the Leftist Image of Qu Yuan
SO FRONTIERS OF LITERARY STUDIES IN CHINA
AB "Make the past serve the present!" Thus goes Mao Zedong's slogan on how to appropriate the ancient in revolutionary times. In my previous studies, I have argued that the Chinese writers' engagement with the ancient gave rise to a platform of "necessary anachronism" in cultural transformation. This new project carries further this argument and draws attention to the transmediality in the leftist historical imagination. From the 1940s through the 1970s, the revolutionary representations of the ancient were simultaneously poetic, theatrical, intellectual, and cinematic, to say nothing about the calligraphic and visual adaptations they elicited. This current of reinventing the ancient manifested itself in the historical drama in wartime China and found a coda in the anti-colonial leftist cinematic adaptation of the historical play Qu Yuan in 1970s Hong Kong. Starting with a broader theoretical intervention into the issue of media, this paper emphasizes that the transmedial reinterpretation of the ancient in fact formed a mode of mediation between revolution and history, between politics and aesthetics. In the cultural regime of China's long revolution, the transference or translation of the allegorical-anachronistic energies among different media was a key site of signification, contestation, and crisis.

TI Targeted and Untargeted Proteomics Approaches in Biomarker Development
SO PROTEOMICS
AB An enormous amount of research effort has been devoted to biomarker discovery and validation. With the completion of the human genome, proteomics is now playing an increasing role in this search for new and better biomarkers. Here, what leads to successful biomarker development is reviewed and how these features may be applied in the context of proteomic biomarker research is considered. The "fit-for-purpose" approach to biomarker development suggests that untargeted proteomic approaches may be better suited for early stages of biomarker discovery, while targeted approaches are preferred for validation and implementation. A systematic screening of published biomarker articles using MS-based proteomics reveals that while both targeted and untargeted technologies are used in proteomic biomarker development, most researchers do not combine these approaches. i) The reasons for this discrepancy, (ii) how proteomic technologies can overcome technical challenges that seem to limit their translation into the clinic, and (iii) how MS can improve, complement, or replace existing clinically important assays in the future are discussed.

SO COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR
   BIOLOGY
AB The products of dax1, foxl2a and mis have each been shown to have proliferative and/or differentiative activities during mammalian organogenesis. These factors also play a role in regulating the biosynthesis of estrogen, particularly by modulating the activity of aromatase cyp19a. We demonstrate the transcription and translation of these genes during salmon embryogenesis. We were able to track sex-specific differences in these processes through accurate determination of the sex of each embryo and larva examined from genotyped microsatellites. We detected sex- and stage-specific immunolabeling of the embryonic gut, kidney, gonads, neural cord and skeletal muscle by DAX-1, FOXL2A and MIS. These results indicate the potential of these factors to mediate proliferation and/or differentiation programs during development of these tissues. As well, immunolabeling of skeletal muscle by CYP19B1 throughout the study reveals probable neurogenic activity associated with peripheral radial glial cells and the growing embryonic musculature.

TI MicroRNA-145 Inhibitor Significantly Improves the Development of Bovine
   Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer Embryos In Vitro
SO CELLULAR REPROGRAMMING
AB Directly regulating the translation of POU5F1, SOX2, KLF4, and miRNA-145 plays an important role in maintaining the pluripotency of stem cells and the development of early embryos. In the present study, the expression model of miRNA-145 on bovine somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) and in vitro fertilized (IVF) embryos were investigated and compared. Results indicated that (1) the expression level of miRNA-145 was significantly higher in SCNT embryos than that in IVF embryos after the eight-cell stage; (2) miRNA-145 negatively regulated the POU5F1, SOX2, and KLF4 in bovine embryos; (3) decreasing the expression of miRNA-145 by the miRNA-145 inhibitor significantly enhanced the expression of these three genes and the blastocyst formation rate; it also increased the total cell number and inner cell mass ratio of the bovine day 7 SCNT embryos. In conclusion, decreasing miRNA-145 expression might be a feasible means to enhance SCNT efficiency in bovines.

AB The study was undertaken to decipher the microRNA (miRNA) related markers associated with corpus luteum (CL) tropism in buffalo. The data obtained from deep sequencing of CL tissue from different physiological stages was mined in silico for the identification of miRNA-related markers (SSR & SNP). From the present study, 5 annotated and 176 unannotated miRNA were deduced while comparing with Bos taunts genome. In addition, 4 SSRs and 9 SNPs were deduced from the miRNA sequences. These SSRs were on the genes viz. Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1-like, myocyte enhancer factor 2A, beta casein, T cell receptor gamma cluster 1. The SNP positions on genes viz. PYGO1 (Pygopus family PHD finger 1), LOC100337244 (Multidrug resistance-associated protein 4), FTH1 (Ferritin heavy chain 1), LOC788634 (BOLA class I histocompatibility antigen), PLXND1 (Plexin Dl) and UBC (Ubiquitin C) show that these genes play critical role in CL tropism during estrous cycle in buffalo.

TI OsGatB, the Subunit of tRNA-Dependent Amidotransferase, Is Required for
   Primary Root Development in Rice
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB A short-root rice mutant was isolated from an ethyl methane sulfonate-mutagenized library. From map-based cloning strategy, a point mutation, resulting in an amino acid change from proline to leucine, was identified in the fourth exon of a glutamyl-tRNA (Gin) amidotransferase B subunit family protein (OsGatB, LOC_Os11g34210). This gene is an ortholog of Arabidopsis GatB and yeast PET112. GatB is a subunit of tRNA-dependent amidotransferase (AdT), an essential enzyme involved in Gln-tRNA(Gln) synthesis in mitochondria. Although previous studies have described that cessation in mitochondrial translation is lethal at very early developmental stages in plants, this point mutation resulted in a non-lethal phenotype of smaller root meristem and shorter root cell length. In the root, OsGatB was predominantly expressed in the root tip and played an important role in cell division and elongation there. OsGatB was localized in the mitochondria, and mitochondrial structure and function were all affected in Osgatb root tip cells.

The close-up also plays a crucial role in the move from a stylized operatic mode of representation to a social realist mode in Cantonese cinema, in addition to performing the function of highlighting performance skills or the texture of a sentiment or an emotional trajectory. Here, through an analysis of the salience of the close-up in Cantonese opera films, and the relation between affect, folklore and Cantonese opera films, I argue that the preponderance of heightened emotion in Cantonese opera films, the perpetuation of the commonsensical view and philosophical conceptions in the approach to challenges and aggression, and the role of the close-up in the translation between stage and screen has given rise to an idiomatic Cantonese cinema in correspondence to the cultural context of Hong Kong and its Cantonese audience.

AB Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) was once considered to be the "noise" of genome transcription without biological function. However, increasing evidence shows that lncRNA is dynamically expressed in developmental stage or disease status, playing a regulatory role in the process of gene expression and translation. In recent years, lncRNA is considered to be a core node of functional regulatory networks that controls cardiac and also involves in multiple process of heart failure such as myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, angiogenesis, etc., which would be a therapeutic target for diseases. In fact, it is the development of technology that has improved our understanding of lncRNAs and broadened our perspective on heart failure. From transcriptional "noise" to star molecule, progress of lncRNAs can't be achieved without the combination of multidisciplinary technologies, especially the emergence of high-throughput approach. Thus, here, we review the strategies and technologies available for the exploration lncRNAs and try to yield insights into the prospect of lncRNAs in clinical diagnosis and treatment in heart failure.

SO BIOSCIENCE BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
AB Novel Corona virus (COVID-19) pandemic has affected numerous lives worldwide. This constant transmission of a novel coronavirus and its ability to rapidly spread from human to human has prompted scientists to develop new approaches for the treatment of COVID-19. Nanotechnology is an emerging field that can be implicated to battle against the COVID-19.Nanomedicine could be a significant theranostic means to fight against CoVs and the host cells. Nanoparticles which are embedded with viral antigens or antibodies show promising results against the SARS-CoV-2 and the re-emerging CoV. Through this communication, it is suggested that nanoparticles may play an important role at different stages of COVID-19 pathogenesis, considering their inhibition potential in the initial attachment and membrane fusion during viral entry and infected cell protein fusion. Furthermore, nano encapsulated drugs may be more efficient in activating intracellular mechanisms to cause irreversible damage to viruses and inhibition of viral transcription, translation and replication.

AB The discursive use of language in legal contexts is multifaceted and complex. First, it begins with the chain of oral narrative structures (victim, witness, suspect accounts) and written texts (confessions, notes, depositions, letters, Internet documents, email, tweets, telephone records) used in a court of law. The transcription of oral communiques is a potentially transformative phase of evidence production that may be flawed (ambiguity, error, mistakes, gaps, misrepresentation). Second, it includes or/excludes the textual and narrative representation of nonverbal communication (kinesics, paralanguage, proxemics) and how it is recorded (transcripts, graphics, video, enactments). At each stage of the legal process, interpretation of narrative structures and texts plays a key role in the ultimate meaning of verbal and nonverbal communication. Third, it concerns interrogation strategies and tactics in preliminary evidence gathering as well as in the courtroom. Fourth, it involves translation of documents written in another language or interpretation of oral statements in another language to the language of the courtroom.

TI The role of microRNAs in depression
SO FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
AB Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a psychiatric disorder with increasing prevalence worldwide. It is a leading cause of disability and suicide, severely affecting physical and mental health. However, the study of depression remains at an exploratory stage in terms of diagnostics and treatment due to the complexity of its pathogenesis. MicroRNAs are endogenous short-stranded non-coding RNAs capable of binding to the 3'untranslated region of mRNAs. Because of their ability to repress translation process of genes and are found at high levels in brain tissues, investigation of their role in depression has gradually increased recently. This article summarizes recent research progress on the relationship between microRNAs and depression. The microRNAs play a regulatory role in the pathophysiology of depression, involving dysregulation of monoamines, abnormalities in neuroplasticity and neurogenesis, hyperactivity of the HPA axis, and dysregulation of inflammatory responses. These microRNAs might provide new clue for the diagnosis and treatment of MDD, and the development of antidepressant drugs.

TI Inhibitory microcircuits for top-down plasticity of sensory
   representations
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Rewards influence plasticity of early sensory representations, but the underlying changes in circuitry are unclear. Recent experimental findings suggest that inhibitory circuits regulate learning. In addition, inhibitory neurons are highly modulated by diverse long-range inputs, including reward signals. We, therefore, hypothesise that inhibitory plasticity plays a major role in adjusting stimulus representations. We investigate how top-down modulation by rewards interacts with local plasticity to induce long-lasting changes in circuitry. Using a computational model of layer 2/3 primary visual cortex, we demonstrate how interneuron circuits can store information about rewarded stimuli to instruct long-term changes in excitatory connectivity in the absence of further reward. In our model, stimulus-tuned somatostatin-positive interneurons develop strong connections to parvalbumin-positive interneurons during reward such that they selectively disinhibit the pyramidal layer henceforth. This triggers excitatory plasticity, leading to increased stimulus representation. We make specific testable predictions and show that this two-stage model allows for translation invariance of the learned representation.

TI Unsupervised Online Learning for Robotic Interestingness With Visual
   Memory
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS
AB Autonomous robots frequently need to detect "interesting" scenes to decide on further exploration, or to decide which data to share for cooperation. These scenarios often require fast deployment with little or no training data. Prior work considers "interestingness" based on data from the same distribution. Instead, we propose to develop a method that automatically adapts online to the environment to report interesting scenes quickly. To address this problem, we develop a novel translation-invariant visual memory and design a three-stage architecture for long-term, short-term, and online learning, which enables the system to learn human-like experience, environmental knowledge, and online adaption, respectively. With this system, we achieve an average of 20% higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods in a subterranean tunnel environment. We show comparable performance to supervised methods for robot exploration scenarios showing the efficacy of our approach. We expect that the presented method will play an important role in the robotic interestingness recognition exploration tasks.

TI Role of DNA De-methylation intermediate?5-hydroxymethylcytosine? in
   ovarian cancer management: A comprehensive review
SO BIOMEDICINE & PHARMACOTHERAPY
AB Ovarian cancer remains the most eminent silent killer, with high morbidity and mortality among all gynaecological cancers. The advanced-stage patient???s diagnosis has a low survival rate caused by its asymptomatic progression and diverse histopathological sub-types, wherefore in poor prognosis and highly recurring malignancy with multidrug resistance towards chemotherapy. Epigenetic biomarkers open promising avenues of intriguing research to combat OC malignancy, furthermore a tool for its early diagnosis. 5-hydroxymethycytosine (5-hmC), alias the sixth base of the genome, is an intermediate formed during the recently established DNA demethylation process and catalysed via ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of enzymes. It plays a significant role in regulating gene expression and has sparked interest in various cancer types. This review summarizes the role of active DNA demethylation process, its enzymes and intermediate 5-hmC in epigenetic landscape of ovarian cancer as a potent biomarker for clinical translation in identification of therapeutic targets, diagnostic and prognostic evaluation.

TI Heme Oxygenase-1 in Kidney Health and Disease
SO ANTIOXIDANTS & REDOX SIGNALING
AB Significance: Acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) represent a considerable burden in healthcare. The heme oxygenase (HO) system plays an important role in regulating oxidative stress and is protective in a variety of human and animal models of kidney disease. Preclinical studies of the HO system have led to the development of several clinical trials targeting the enzyme or its products. Recent Advances: Connection of HO, ferritin, and other proteins involved in iron regulation has provided important insight into mechanisms of damage in AKI. Also, HO-1 expression is important in the pathogenesis of hypertension, diabetic kidney disease, and progression to end-stage renal disease. Critical Issues: Despite intriguing discoveries, no drugs targeting the HO system have been translated to the clinic. Meanwhile, treatments for AKI and CKD are urgently needed. Many factors have likely contributed to challenges in clinical translation, including variation in animal models, difficulties in obtaining human tissue, and complexity of the disease processes being studied. Future Directions: The HO system represents a promising avenue of investigation that may lead to targeted therapeutics. Tissue-specific gene modulation, widening the scope of animal studies, and continued clinical research will provide valuable insight into the role HO plays in kidney homeostasis and disease.

TI The naked capitellum: a surgeon's guide to intraoperative identification
   of posterolateral rotatory instability
SO JOURNAL OF SHOULDER AND ELBOW SURGERY
AB Hypothesis: This study's purpose was to provide a reproducible way for surgeons to intraoperatively assess the elbow's lateral ulnar collateral ligament origin and determine whether there is posterolateral rotatory instability (PLRI) despite an intact common extensor origin (CEO). We hypothesized that we could recreate clinically relevant disruption of lateral supporting structures despite an intact CEO and illustrate progressive elbow PLRI.
   Methods: The relationship of the lateral capsule to the capitellum articular surface was noted in 8 cadaveric upper extremities. The lateral capsule and extensor origin were sequentially sectioned at 4 stages: intact, release to the lateral epicondyle, release of the posterior capsular insertion, and release of the CEO. Posterior and lateral translation of the radial head (RH) relative to the capitellum was measured with the forearm in extension and supination.
   Results: The average specimen age was 78.9 years. The lateral capsule originated within 1 to 2 mm of the capitellum articular surface. Lateral capsular sectioning to the 6-o'clock position of the lateral epicondyle created an unstable elbow with posterior and lateral RH translation. Sequential sectioning of the posterior capsular insertion created significant additional RH translation posteriorly (P < .05). With release of the capsule and the extensor origin, the elbow was grossly unstable.
   Conclusions: The elbow's lateral capsuloligamentous complex plays an important role in preventing PLRI. Larger degrees of elbow laxity are associated with further peel back of the capsuloligamentous complex despite an intact CEO. The surgeon must retract the extensor origin intraoperatively to assess for lateral ulnar collateral ligament and/or lateral capsule disruption to prevent a missed case of PLRI.

TI Upregulation of miR-101 during Influenza A Virus Infection Abrogates
   Viral Life Cycle by Targeting mTOR Pathway
SO VIRUSES-BASEL
AB Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding single-stranded RNA, which play an important role in modulating host-Influenza A virus (IAV) crosstalk. The interplay between influenza and miRNA interaction is defined by a plethora of complex mechanisms, which are not fully understood yet. Here, we demonstrate that in IAV infected A549 cells, a synchronous increase was observed in the expression of mTOR up to 24 hpi and significant downregulation at 48 hpi. Additionally, NP of IAV interacts with mTOR and modulates the levels of mTOR mRNA and protein, thus regulating the translation of host cell. RNA sequencing and qPCR analysis of IAV-infected A549 cells and NP transfected cells revealed that miR-101 downregulates mTOR transcripts at later stages of infection. Ectopic expression of miR-101 mimic led to a decrease in expression of NP, a reduction in IAV titer and replication. Moreover, treatment of the cells with Everolimus, a potent inhibitor of mTOR, resulted in an increase of miR-101 transcript levels, which further suppressed the viral protein synthesis. Collectively, the data suggest a novel mechanism that IAV stimulates mTOR pathway at early stages of infection; however, at a later time-point, positive regulation of miR-101 restrains the mTOR expression, and hence, the viral propagation.

TI Open chromatin analysis in Trypanosoma cruzi life forms highlights
   critical differences in genomic compartments and developmental
   regulation at tDNA loci
SO EPIGENETICS & CHROMATIN
AB Background Genomic organization and gene expression regulation in trypanosomes are remarkable because protein-coding genes are organized into codirectional gene clusters with unrelated functions. Moreover, there is no dedicated promoter for each gene, resulting in polycistronic gene transcription, with posttranscriptional control playing a major role. Nonetheless, these parasites harbor epigenetic modifications at critical regulatory genome features that dynamically change among parasite stages, which are not fully understood. Results Here, we investigated the impact of chromatin changes in a scenario commanded by posttranscriptional control exploring the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and its differentiation program using FAIRE-seq approach supported by transmission electron microscopy. We identified differences in T. cruzi genome compartments, putative transcriptional start regions, and virulence factors. In addition, we also detected a developmental chromatin regulation at tRNA loci (tDNA), which could be linked to the intense chromatin remodeling and/or the translation regulatory mechanism required for parasite differentiation. We further integrated the open chromatin profile with public transcriptomic and MNase-seq datasets. Strikingly, a positive correlation was observed between active chromatin and steady-state transcription levels. Conclusion Taken together, our results indicate that chromatin changes reflect the unusual gene expression regulation of trypanosomes and the differences among parasite developmental stages, even in the context of a lack of canonical transcriptional control of protein-coding genes.

TI Stem Cell-derived Exosomal MicroRNA as Therapy for Vascular Age-related
   Diseases
SO AGING AND DISEASE
AB Vascular age-related diseases describe a group of age-related chronic diseases that result in a considerable healthcare burden to society. Vascular aging includes structural changes and dysfunctions of endothelial cell (EC) and smooth muscle cell (SMC) in blood vessels. Compared with conventional treatments for vascular age-related diseases, stem cell (SC) therapy elicits better anti-aging effects via the inhibition/delay ECs and SMCs from entering senescence. Exosomal noncoding RNA (ncRNAs) in vascular aging and stem cellderived exosomal microRNAs (SCEV-miRNAs), especially in mesenchymal stem cells, have an important role in the development of age-related diseases. This review summarizes SCEV-miRNAs of diverse origins that may play a vital role in treating subclinical and clinical stages of vascular age-related disorders. We further explored possible age-related pathways and molecular targets of SCEV-miRNA, which are associated with dysfunctions of ECs and SMCs in the senescent stage. Moreover, the perspectives and difficulties of SCEV-miRNA clinical translation are discussed. This review aims to provide greater understanding of the biology of vascular aging and to identify critical therapeutic targets for SCEV-miRNAs. Though still in its infancy, the potential value of SCEVmiRNAs for vascular age-related diseases is clear.

TI Abce1 orchestrates M-phase entry and cytoskeleton architecture in mouse
   oocyte
SO ONCOTARGET
AB ATP-binding cassette E1 (ABCE1) is a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporters and essential for diverse biological events regulating abroad range of biological functions including viral infection, cell proliferation, anti-apoptosis, translation initiation and ribosome biogenesis. Here, we discovered that Abce1 also plays indispensable roles in mouse oocyte meiotic progression. In the present study, we examined the expression, localization, and function of Abce1 during mouse oocyte meiotic maturation. Immunostaining and confocal microscopy identified that Abce1 localized as small dots in nucleus in germinal vesicle stage. After germinal vesicle breakdown, it dispersedly localized around the whole spindle apparatus. During the anaphase and telophase stages, Abce1 was just like a cap to localize around the two pole region of spindle but not the midbody and chromosome. Knockdown of Abce1 by specific siRNA injection delayed the resumption of meiosis (GVBD) and affected the extrusion of first polar body. Moreover, the process of spindle assembly and chromosome alignment were severely impaired. Abce1-RNAi led to the dissociation of gamma-tubulin and p-MAPK from spindle poles, thus caused mounts of spindle morphology abnormities and chromosome alignment defects, leading to high incidence of aneuploidy. Our findings refresh the knowledge of Abce1 function by exploring its role in oocyte meiotic resumption, spindle assembly and chromosome alignment.

TI Ultra-deep sequencing of ribosome-associated poly-adenylated RNA in
   early Drosophila embryos reveals hundreds of conserved translated sORFs
SO DNA RESEARCH
AB There is growing recognition that small open reading frames (sORFs) encoding peptides shorter than 100 amino acids are an important class of functional elements in the eukaryotic genome, with several already identified to play critical roles in growth, development, and disease. However, our understanding of their biological importance has been hindered owing to the significant technical challenges limiting their annotation. Here we combined ultra-deep sequencing of ribosome-associated poly-adenylated RNAs with rigorous conservation analysis to identify a comprehensive population of translated sORFs during early Drosophila embryogenesis. In total, we identify 399 sORFs, including those previously annotated but without evidence of translational capacity, those found within transcripts previously classified as non-coding, and those not previously known to be transcribed. Further, we find, for the first time, evidence for translation of many sORFs with different isoforms, suggesting their regulation is as complex as longer ORFs. Furthermore, many sORFs are found not associated with ribosomes in late-stage Drosophila S2 cells, suggesting that many of the translated sORFs may have stage-specific functions during embryogenesis. These results thus provide the first comprehensive annotation of the sORFs present during early Drosophila embryogenesis, a necessary basis for a detailed delineation of their function in embryogenesis and other biological processes.

TI Identification of a novel long noncoding RNA that promotes osteoblast
   differentiation
SO JOURNAL OF CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a heterogeneous class of transcripts, longer than 200 nucleotides, 5-capped, polyadenylated, and poorly conserved among mammalian species. Several studies have shown the contribution of lncRNAs to different cellular processes, including regulation of the chromatin structure, control of messenger RNA translation, regulation of gene transcription, regulation of embryonic pluripotency, and differentiation. Although limited numbers of functional lncRNAs have been identified so far, the immense regulatory potential of these RNAs is already evident, indicating that a functional characterization of lncRNAs is needed. In this study, mouse preosteoblastic cells were induced to differentiate into osteoblasts. At 3 sequential differentiation stages, total RNA was isolated and libraries were constructed for Illumina sequencing. The resulting sequences were aligned and transcript abundances were determined. New lncRNA candidates that displayed differential expression patterns during osteoblast differentiation were identified by combining bioinformatics and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses. Among these, lncRNA-1 that exhibited increased expression during osteogenesis and was downregulated during myogenesis. Importantly, knockdown of lncRNA-1 expression in primary mouse preosteoblasts was found to inhibit osteogenic differentiation, reflected by a reduced transcription of the Runx2/p57 and Sp7 bone master genes. Together, our results indicate that lncRNA-1 represents a new regulatory RNA that plays a relevant role during the early stages of osteogenesis.

TI Changes in the Distribution Preference of Soil Microbial Communities
   During Secondary Succession in a Temperate Mountain Forest
SO FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB Soil microbes play a crucial role in a forest ecosystem. However, whether the distribution of bacteria and fungi in different forest succession stages is random or following ecological specialization remains to be further studied. In the present study, we characterized soil bacterial and fungal communities to determine their distribution preference, with different succession communities in a temperate mountain forest. The Kruskal-Wallis method was used to analyze structural differences between bacterial and fungal communities in different succession processes. The specificity of soil microbial distribution in a secondary forest was studied by network analysis. The torus-translation test was used to analyze the species distribution preference of soil microbes in different succession stages. Results showed that the species composition of soil bacteria and fungi differed significantly in different succession processes. The modularity index of fungi (0.227) was higher than that of bacteria (0.080). Fungi (54.47%) had specific preferences than bacteria (49.95%) with regard to forests in different succession stages. Our work suggests that the distribution pattern of most soil microbes in a temperate mountain forest was not random but specialized in temperate mountain forests. Different microbes showed different distribution preferences. Fungi were more sensitive than bacteria during secondary succession in a temperate mountain forest. In addition, microbc environment relations varied during secondary succession. Our results provided new insight into the mechanism through which complex soil microbial communities responded to changes in forest community succession.

TI Add-Aptation: Simon Stephens, Carrie Cracknell and Katie Mitchell's
   'Dialogues' with the Classic Canon
SO JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY DRAMA IN ENGLISH
AB Addition and Add-Aptation: This article discusses, in particular, the playwright Simon Stephens's "English Language versions" of Ibsen's A Doll's House and Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard in the context of the long and tangled history of translation and adaptation. Key differences from the conventional claim to be attempting some kind of fidelity to the original in Stephens's approach to the task of creating a new text are considered: an approach which largely adheres to the overall narrative structure of the original but feels free to play with, in particular, the dialogue. This approach is then contrasted with the act of 'appropriation' of an existing text: whilst the act of appropriation results in the creation of an independent play that exists alongside the original, although Stephens actively disrupts expectations of fidelity, his version is still offered as a play by Ibsen or Chekhov. The process is further problematized by the directorial interventions of Carrie Cracknell and Katie Mitchell, working independently and in collaboration with Stephens on their productions of A Doll's House and The Cherry Orchard respectively. I have labelled this process Add-Aptation, to distinguish it from both adaptation per se and appropriation. In an add-apted text the additions are both deliberate and significant Not the least significant factor in this process is that both directors are women, as is increasingly likely to be the case in the world of contemporary theatre.

TI In-depth profiling of miRNA regulation in the body wall of sea cucumber
   Apostichopus japonicus during skin ulceration syndrome progression
SO FISH & SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY
AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that mediate mRNA degradation or translation repression. Previous study showed that the expression of miRNAs was significantly changed in the body wall of sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus after skin ulceration syndrome (SUS) infection, which is a dynamic process. However, the critical miRNAs from body wall that involved in different infection stages of SUS remain unknown. In this study, four cDNA libraries were constructed with the body wall from healthy and three SUS-infected stages of A. japonicus. A total of 248 conserved miRNAs and five novel miRNAs were identified through Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Compared to the control, 238 miRNAs showed significant differential expression at three stages of SUS progression. Totally, 3149 miRNA-mRNA pairs were identified by target prediction and 314 miRNA-mRNA pairs showed negative correlation. It is noteworthy that 15 miRNAs and four mRNAs were located at the crucial positions of the network built with the anti-correlated miRNA-mRNA pairs. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the predicted targets were involved in many immune-related processes. Deep analysis of miR-31c-5p, miR-29b-3p, NF-kappa B, mucin 2 and titin showed that they may play important roles in the pathogens attachment and recognition, signaling transduction and lesions repair of A. japonicus after SUS infection. These results would be useful for further investigating the potential roles of critical miRNAs and mRNAs in A. japonicus immune regulation.

The full lengths of Bmpop-a and Bmpop-b were 2497 and 2508 bp, deducing 707 and 740 amino acids, respectively. Both of them, possessing the typical characteristics of the Pop family of serine proteinase, were detected to be expressed among different tissues and development stages at the transcription and translation levels. Soluble recombinant BmPop-a (rBmPop-a) had oligopeptidase activity toward the substrates, Z-Gly-Pro-pNA, Z-Gly-Pro-AMC and angiotensin I. An inhibition assay showed that the activity of rBmPop-a was significantly inhibited by KYP-2047 and 517092 in vitro. BmPop-b was identified in the molting fluids at three different stages by Western blotting analysis, showing a predominant expression in the integument. Two isoforms of Bmpop gene and other three genes in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the integument were down-regulated by starvation treatments but up-regulated by refeeding. These results suggested that BmPops may play an important role in balancing the molting fluid pressure to guarantee ecdysis normally. This study provides clues for further elucidating the function and regulation mechanisms of two isoforms of Bmpop gene.

TI The Role of miRNA in Differentiation, Cell Proliferation, and
   Pathogenesis of Poultry Diseases
SO RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB To date, several noncoding RNAs are known that play a prominent role in the processes of transcription, translation, and structural conformation of RNA. By binding miRNA to 3'-untranslated regions, mRNA regulates gene expression in animals through inhibition of translation initiation, elongation, and other mechanisms. There is evidence for the differential expression of miRNA that regulates transcription with the inclusion of several stages of myoblast proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. These molecules play a significant role in cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis. Some miRNAs are known to target 100-200 genes. Polymorphisms of miRNA genes, especially in the competent regions of the genome, can be biomarkers for phenotypic traits important for breeding birds. The findings confirm the key role of miRNA in controlling the metabolic switch that occurs between the embryo development and the chick hatching. Differentially expressed miRNAs and their possible target genes are involved in egg production functions. The available miRNA data complement our understanding of the molecular genetic control underlying abdominal fat accumulation and myogenesis in chickens. Hundreds of differentially expressed miRNAs from individuals differing in body weight were found. A new understanding into the functions of miRNA during chicken gonads' rapid development is being formed. Hundreds of miRNAs expressed by hypothalamic genes and involved in the initial phase of rapid gonad growth have been identified. There is increasingly clear evidence that miRNA play a major role in regulating the innate immune response and are important effectors in complex host-pathogen interaction networks for salmonellosis, Marek's disease, carcinogenic, and other diseases. Many of the miRNAs are associated with cell proliferation, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis. Bacterial pathogens are able to modulate the expression of the host miRNAs and affect the regulation of miRNAs and the outcome of infection. Several miRNAs are induced by TLR activation in innate immune cells and target the 3 '-untranslated regions of the mRNA encoding the components of the TLR signaling system. Modern genome-editing tools suggest an artificial increase in the diversity of miRNAs and an increased use of miRNAs for directional action. Structure determination of RNA, RNA-RNA, RNA-DNA, and ribonucleoprotein complexes is becoming a rapidly developing area requiring the development of new technologies.

TI Towards Political and Aestethic Context of P. Corneille's Tragedy
   "Oedipus"
SO NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
AB The article concerns the analysis of "Oedipus", a tragedy by P. Corneille, staged in Paris in January 1659. The play, created on the advice of Superintendent N. Fouquet, has substantial plot differences as compared with classical Oedipus story schemes, dating back to Sophocles and Seneca. Corneille has considerably shortened the tale about the life of Oedipus and Jocasta, and, at the same time, developed the story of Laius' daughter Dirce and her lover Theseus. While analyzing, the author comes to the conclusion that the central subject-matter of Corneille's tragedy is the search for a true king, a blood descendant of Laius, who could sacrifice himself in order to save Thebes from plague. Initially, Oedipus does not understand his mission, nevertheless, towards the end of the play, he becomes a real king, embodiment of the state as a whole. There is a hypothesis that such political pathos could be explained mostly by historical realia of the Fronde, by the tender age of Louis XIV, as well as by pragmatic orientation of the play towards high society audience, for whose pleasure Corneille 'softened' the dreadful details of the ancient myth, and developed Dirce's and Theseus' characters in conformity with the principles of gallantry The author comes to a conclusion that the play with a modified ancient plot turns out to be the embodiment of the 'beautiful infidels' translation strategy, which is based on a pragmatic change of the initial text in accordance with the needs of a certain public. It has been suggested that Corneille could have become with his play, willingly or unwillingly, a partisan of the ideas of the French high society and Fouquet, whose arrest in 1661 was one of the first independent steps of Louis XIV as a French monarch.

TI The role of the iliotibial band during the pivot shift test
SO KNEE SURGERY SPORTS TRAUMATOLOGY ARTHROSCOPY
AB Several studies have suggested that the iliotibial (IT) band plays a role in knee laxity and that it may affect the magnitude of the pivot shift observed. However, the extent of the role played by the IT band, as well as its mechanism of action, is not currently known. This cadaveric study aimed to quantify the effect of the IT band and the hip abduction angle on the magnitude of anterior tibial translation (ATT) during the pivot shift.
   Six fresh-frozen hip-to-toes specimens were used. Serial sectioning of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and the IT band was performed. Lachman and mechanized pivot shift manoeuvres were employed at each stage, and ATT of the lateral and medial compartments was measured using navigation. Three hip abduction angles were tested for each condition: 0A degrees, 15A degrees and 30A degrees.
   Sequential sectioning of the ACL and the IT band resulted in a significant increase in ATT in both the lateral (Intact = 0 +/- A 0.5 mm; ACL deficient = 8.1 +/- A 0.2 mm; ACL + IT deficient = 10.8 +/- A 0.3 mm) and medial (Intact = 6.7 +/- A 0.4 mm; ACL deficient = 8.4 +/- A 0.3 mm; ACL + IT deficient = 9.9 +/- A 0.3 mm) compartments. No significant increase in ATT was observed after changing the hip abduction angle at each stage.
   An increase in the magnitude of the pivot shift and the Lachman was observed as the constraint of the IT band was removed. Additionally, it was shown that the hip abduction angle at which the pivot shift test was performed did not significantly affect the magnitude of ATT in this cadaveric model.

TI A novel AR translational regulator lncRNA LBCS inhibits castration
   resistance of prostate cancer
SO MOLECULAR CANCER
AB BackgroundProgression to a castration resistance state is the main cause of deaths in prostate cancer (PCa) patients. Androgen Receptor (AR) signaling plays the central role in progression of Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC), therefore understanding the mechanisms of AR activation in the milieu of low androgen is critical to discover novel approach to treat CRPC.MethodsFirstly, we explore the CRPC associated lncRNAs by transcriptome microarray. The expression and clinical features of lnc-LBCS are analyzed in three independent large-scale cohorts. The functional role and mechanism of lnc-LBCS are further investigated by gain and loss of function assays in vitro.ResultsThe expression of Lnc-LBCS was lower in CRPC cells lines and tissues. LBCS downregulation was correlated with higher Gleason Score, T stage and poor prognosis of PCa patients. LBCS overexpression decreases, whereas LBCS knockdown increases, the traits of castration resistance in prostate cancer cells under androgen ablated or AR blocked condition. Moreover, knockdown of LBCS was sufficient to activate AR signaling in the absence of androgen by elevating the translation of AR protein. Mechanistically, LBCS interacted directly with hnRNPK to suppress AR translation efficiency by forming complex with hnRNPK and AR mRNA.ConclusionsLnc-LBCS functions as a novel AR translational regulator that suppresses castration resistance of prostate cancer by interacting with hnRNPK. This sheds a new insight into the regulation of CRPC by lncRNA mediated AR activation and LBCS-hnRNPK-AR axis provides a promising approach to the treatment of CRPC.

TI Imaging-guided delivery of RNAi for anticancer treatment
SO ADVANCED DRUG DELIVERY REVIEWS
AB The RNA interference (RNAi) technique is a new modality for cancer therapy, and several candidates are being tested clinically. In the development of RNAi-based therapeutics, imaging methods can provide a visible and quantitative way to investigate the therapeutic effect at anatomical, cellular, and molecular level; to noninvasively trace the distribution; to and study the biological processes in preclinical and clinical stages. Their abilities are important not only for therapeutic optimization and evaluation but also for shortening of the time of drug development to market. Typically, imaging-functionalized RNAi therapeutics delivery that combines nanovehicles and imaging techniques to study and improve their biodistribution and accumulation in tumor site has been progressively integrated into anticancer drug discovery and development processes. This review presents an overview of the current status of translating the RNAi cancer therapeutics in the clinic, a brief description of the biological barriers in drug delivery, and the roles of imaging in aspects of administration route, systemic circulation, and cellular barriers for the clinical translation of RNAi cancer therapeutics, and with partial content for discussing the safety concerns. Finally, we focus on imaging-guided delivery of RNAi therapeutics in preclinical development, including the basic principles of different imaging modalities, and their advantages and limitations for biological imaging. With growing number of RNAi therapeutics entering the clinic, various imaging methods will play an important role in facilitating the translation of RNAi cancer therapeutics from bench to bedside.

TI Orally delivered rutin in lipid-based nano-formulation exerts strong
   antithrombotic effects by protein disulfide isomerase inhibition
SO DRUG DELIVERY
AB Thrombosis occurs in both macrovasculature and microvasculature, causing various cardio-cerebral vascular diseases. The lack of effective and safe antithrombotic drugs leads to a public health crisis. Mounting evidence suggests that protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) plays a critical role in the initial stage of thrombus formation, motivating the research of the feasibility of PDI inhibitors as novel anti-thrombotics. Rutin, one of the most potent PDI inhibitors, was reported to suppress platelet aggregation and thrombosis in animal models, but further studies and clinical translation were restricted due to its low aqueous solubility and oral bioavailability. In this work, we fabricated rutin-loaded lipid-based nano-formulation (NanoR) and characterized their physical-chemical properties, release profiles, pharmacokinetic process, and pharmacodynamic function against thrombosis in macrovessels and microvessels. NanoR provided increased solubility and dissolution of rutin to achieve earlier T (max) and higher C (max) than the sodium salt of rutin (NaR) after oral gavage. Ex vivo studies demonstrated that NanoR significantly inhibited thrombin generation and clot formation in the plasma of mice. Importantly, such effect was reversed by exogenous recombinant PDI, demonstrating the specificity of the NanoR. In direct current-induced arterial thrombosis model and ferric chloride-induced microvascular thrombosis model, NanoR exhibited greatly enhanced antithrombotic activity compared with NaR. NanoR also showed good safety performance according to tail bleeding assay, global coagulation tests, and histological analysis. Overall, our current results indicated that NanoR offers a promising antithrombotic treatment with potential for clinical translation.

TI A novel LncRNA HITT forms a regulatory loop with HIF-1 alpha to modulate
   angiogenesis and tumor growth
SO CELL DEATH AND DIFFERENTIATION
AB Increasing evidence has indicated that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in human diseases, including cancer; however, only a few of them have been experimentally validated and functionally annotated. Here, we identify a novel lncRNA that we term HITT (HIF-1 alpha inhibitor at translation level). HITT is commonly decreased in multiple human cancers. Decreased HITT is associated with advanced stages of colon cancer. Restoration of the expression of HITT in cancer cells inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo in an HIF-1 alpha-dependent manner. Further study reveals that HITT inhibits HIF-1 alpha expression, mainly by interfering with its translation. Mechanically, HITT titrates away YB-1 from the 5 '-UTR of HIF-1 alpha mRNA via a high-stringency YB-1-binding motif. The reverse correlation between HITT and HIF-1 alpha expression is further validated in human colon cancer tissues. Moreover, HITT is one of the most altered lncRNAs upon the hypoxic switch and HITT downregulation is required for hypoxia-induced HIF-1 alpha expression. We further demonstrate that HITT and HIF-1 alpha form an autoregulatory feedback loop where HIF-1 alpha destabilizes HITT by inducing MiR-205, which directly targets HITT for degradation. Together, these results expand our understanding of the cancer-associated functions of lncRNAs, highlighting the HITT-HIF-1 alpha axis as constituting an additional layer of regulation of angiogenesis and tumor growth, with potential implications for therapeutic targeting.

TI Pisum sativum p68 DEAD-box protein is ATP-dependent RNA helicase and
   unique bipolar DNA helicase
SO PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB DEAD-box helicases play essential role in DNA and RNA metabolism such as replication, repair, recombination, transcription, translation, ribosome biogenesis and splicing which regulate plant growth and development. The presence of helicases in the stress-induced ORFs identified by cDNA microarray indicates that helicases might be playing an important role in stabilizing growth in plants under stress. p68 DEAD-box helicase has been identified and characterized from animal systems but the properties and functions of plant p68 are poorly understood. In this study, the identification, purification and characterization of recombinant p68 from Pisum sativum (Psp68) is presented. Psp68 possesses all the characteristic motifs like DEAD-box ATP-binding and helicase C terminal motifs and is structurally similar to human p68 homologue. Psp68 exhibits ATPase activity in the presence of both DNA and RNA and it binds to DNA as well as RNA. It contains the characteristic RNA helicase activity. Interestingly Psp68 also shows the unique DNA helicase activity, which is bipolar in nature (unwinds DNA in both the 5'aEuro"3' and 3'aEuro"5' directions). The Km values of Psp68 for ATPase are 0.5126 and 0.9142 mM in the presence of DNA and RNA, respectively. The Km values of Psp68 are 1.6129 and 1.14 nM for DNA helicase and RNA helicase, respectively. The unique properties of Psp68 suggest that it could be a multifunctional protein involved in different aspect of DNA and RNA metabolism. This discovery should make an important contribution to better understanding of nucleic acids metabolism plants.

TI Hugo von Hofmannsthal. "Notices for a Xenodoxus" (1920-1925) From the
   neo-baroque to the crisis of modernity
SO ETUDES GERMANIQUES
AB Hugo von Hofmannsthal expressed his wish to adapt the neo-Latin Tragicomedy Cenodoxus (1602-1609) by the Jesuit playwright Jacob Bidermann on the very day his new version of the morality play Jedermann (Everyman) was staged, on 26 August 1920. Hofmannsthal did not use the original Latin version, but the German translation (1635) by Joachim Meichel. From early on, Hofmannsthal set his work in the vicinity of 16th-century historicaUliterary figures, in particular Agrippa and Faust. However, his reading of the Judgment play of Radstadt, of Styrian origin, inspired him to give the Christian tragedy an optimistic ending, in the tradition of the late medieval miracle plays.
   Josef Nadler's theses on Catholic Baroque literature in Southern Germany and Austria had a great impact on Hofmannsthal's choice of subject. However, he intended to tackle once again, and in a novel way, the crisis that his country and the European continent as a whole were going through in the wake of the First World War. In his play, Hofmannsthal makes withering comments about the harmful impact of technological development on the moral values of the community, hence his warnings against interventions on the human body. The distinction, which in his view is absolute, between true and false science, is based on E. Hello's philosophical and theological views and on H. G. Wells' Science Fiction Novel The Island of Dr. Moreau, which reflects the entanglement of man and animal. Thus, Hofmannsthal expresses his anguish at the sight of a world spiralling "out of joint". The reason why his dramatic sketch remained unfinished lies first and foremost in the almost unlimited number of gathered Notes. But even more crucial was Hofmannsthal's renunciation to produce a relatively clear plot line at an early stage of the work, because of his use of the Benjaminian melancholy. The "laziness of the heart", consubstantial with acedia, is indeed contrary to the vital impulse that pushes the protagonist to act without any rest. It is the diametrically opposite of Benjamin's postulate of the sovereign as a character unfit for action.

TI Deconstructing the Saussurean System of Signification Miyagi Satoshi and
   His Mimetic Dramaturgy in Miyagi-Noh Othello
SO CRITICAL SURVEY
AB Shakespeare's Othello has been staged overwhelmingly through the racial relationship between the two protagonists, Othello and Iago, at the expense of another protagonist, Desdemona, partly because of the prominence of racial and military perspectives in European modernity, and partly because of the relatively scarce textual presence of Desdemona. Despite the tremendous efforts and contributions of feminist criticism to rectify the imbalance, this female protagonist has been enclosed in the realm of a patriarchal framework that divides women between 'chaste wife' and 'villainous whore'. Miyagi Satoshi's adaptation and staging of Miyagi-Noh Othello, presented at Shizuoka Arts Theatre in 2018, was a remarkable attempt to address this issue, by transforming the whole play into a memory recollected and enacted by the Ghost of Desdemona, through utilising the Japanese 'Mugen-Noh' format. Through his mimetic dramaturgy employing the 'division of speech and movement' method, Miyagi succeeded in recovering not only Desdemona's testimonies regarding her affectionate and passionate relationship with Othello but also multiple women's 'her-stories' hidden and disregarded by male-centred histories authorised by the Venetian ruling class. The detailed analysis of Miyagi's unique and innovative production will unravel the complicated relationship between actors' words and their bodies in theatrical productions, as well as offer a fresh insight into the hitherto underrated aspect of Othello as an alternative story of inducing everyone's suffering into spiritual atonement by reviving the love which has always already been present even in a society torn by racism, genderism and militarism.

TI Pou5f1/Oct4 Promotes Cell Survival via Direct Activation of mych
   Expression during Zebrafish Gastrulation
SO PLOS ONE
AB Myc proteins control cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis, and play important roles in cancer as well in establishment of pluripotency. Here we investigated the control of myc gene expression by the Pou5f1/Oct4 pluripotency factor in the early zebrafish embryo. We analyzed the expression of all known zebrafish Myc family members, myca, mycb, mych, mycl1a, mycl1b, and mycn, by whole mount in situ hybridization during blastula and gastrula stages in wildtype and maternal plus zygotic pou5f1 mutant (MZspg) embryos, as well as by quantitative PCR and in time series microarray data. We found that the broad blastula and gastrula stage mych expression, as well as late gastrula stage mycl1b expression, both depend on Pou5f1 activity. We analyzed ChIP-Seq data and found that both Pou5f1 and Sox2 bind to mych and mycl1b control regions. The regulation of mych by Pou5f1 appears to be direct transcriptional activation, as overexpression of a Pou5f1 activator fusion protein in MZspg embryos induced strong mych expression even when translation of zygotically expressed mRNAs was suppressed. We further showed that MZspg embryos develop enhanced apoptosis already during early gastrula stages, when apoptosis was not be detected in wildtype embryos. However, Mych knockdown alone did not induce early apoptosis, suggesting potentially redundant action of several early expressed myc genes, or combination of several pathways affected in MZspg. Experimental mych overexpression in MZspg embryos did significantly, but not completely suppress the apoptosis phenotype. Similarly, p53 knockdown only partially suppressed apoptosis in MZspg gastrula embryos. However, combined knockdown of p53 and overexpression of Mych completely rescued the MZspg apoptosis phenotype. These results reveal that Mych has anti-apoptotic activity in the early zebrafish embryo, and that p53-dependent and Myc pathways are likely to act in parallel to control apoptosis at these stages.

TI The comic in Udmurt folklore and artistic literature of the late XIX -
   early XX centuries
SO VESTNIK UGROVEDENIYA-BULLETIN OF UGRIC STUDIES
AB Introduction: the comic is one of the ways of artistic reflection of reality. It shows the peculiarities of the national worldview at the certain period of history. To generalize the stages of evolution of the comic in literature, to establish cause-and-effect relationships of development of genres and forms of the comic, it is necessary to identify its origins. The article discusses the prerequisites for the origin of the comic in Udmurt literature and their originality at the initial stage of its development.
   Objective: to identify the origins and features of formation of comic genres in Udmurt literature in the aspect of continuity of traditions of oral folk art.
   Research materials: satirical and humorous works of Udmurt folklore and the initial stage of development of national literature.
   Results and novelty of the research: prerequisites of the comic in Udmurt literature are contained in laughing culture of the people, in rituals and rites that perform a magical function. An important source of the origin of literary comic genres was the genres of oral folk art with a dominant social function. A significant role was also played by the translation and cultural activities of the enlighteners, as well as the influence of older literatures. Based on the genres of oral and poetic creativity (comic, satirical, dance and game songs, fairy tales, fables, madyos, takmak) and taking into account, first of all, the experience of Russian literature, comic works of various genres are created in the Udmurt language.
   For the first time the article considers poorly studied works of Udmurt comic literature of the late XIX - early XX centuries. These are works of different genres of folklore origins: verses, poems, plays, essays, stories, novellas, feuilletons, parables, fables, madyos, new takmak, pamphlets, "light tales", etc. The educational theme of the first works gradually acquires a social and socio-political meaning complicating the poetics of the comic.

TI Stress Granules Involved in Formation, Progression and Metastasis of
   Cancer: A Scoping Review
SO FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB The assembly of stress granules (SGs) is a well-known cellular strategy for reducing stress-related damage and promoting cell survival. SGs have become important players in human health, in addition to their fundamental role in the stress response. The critical role of SGs in cancer cells in formation, progression, and metastasis makes sense. Recent researchers have found that several SG components play a role in tumorigenesis and cancer metastasis via tumor-associated signaling pathways and other mechanisms. Gene-ontology analysis revealed the role of these protein components in the structure of SGs. Involvement in the translation process, regulation of mRNA stability, and action in both the cytoplasm and nucleus are among the main features of SG proteins. The present scoping review aimed to consider all studies on the effect of SGs on cancer formation, proliferation, and metastasis and performed based on a six-stage methodology structure and the PRISMA guideline. A systematic search of seven databases for qualified articles was conducted before July 2021. Publications were screened, and quantitative and qualitative analysis was performed on the extracted data. Go analysis was performed on seventy-one SGs protein components. Remarkably G3BP1, TIA1, TIAR, and YB1 have the largest share among the proteins considered in the studies. Altogether, this scoping review tries to demonstrate and provide a comprehensive summary of the role of SGs in the formation, progression, and metastasis of cancer by reviewing all studies.

TI Seeing Shakespeare: Narco narratives and neocolonial appropriations of
   Macbeth in the US-Mexico Borderlands
SO LITERATURE COMPASS
AB This essay examines the racializing logics and consequences of drawing analogies between the works of William Shakespeare and the devastatingly violent realities of the drug trade in the Americas. The particular prominence of Macbeth in the wide range of Shakespearean invocations and appropriations in contemporary US narratives about narcotrafficking cannot be attributed simply to the fact that it is a tale of bloody ambition. Rather, the repeated mapping of a play that comes to its conclusion with an English military invasion of its "barbarous" Scottish neighbors onto the US-Mexico Borderlands speaks to much deeper histories of colonial conquest and to neocolonial interventionist policies and actions of the present. The essay concludes by turning to two recent instances in which theater artists have translated and significantly revised Macbeth in order to reframe dominant narratives about narcotrafficking, racial supremacy, and the border. These productions demonstrate the disruptive and transformative potential of Shakespearean appropriations that resist neocolonial power structures and ideologies.

TI Pengchun Chang's Contributions to International Human Rights in Global
   Governance
SO HUMAN RIGHTS QUARTERLY
AB In the early stage of the United Nations, Pengchun Chang (P. C. Chang), the outstanding Chinese representative, participated in the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and made prominent contributions in global governance. This article attempts to use triangulations to analyze and discuss the significant role played by Chang in constructing the international human rights system by employing literature studies, empirical studies and a case study. It is believed that it was not accidental for Chang to make such contributions to international human rights, and his cleverness and wisdom benefited from both the excellent traditional Chinese culture and the Western philosophies and essentials of his Western education.

TI Singular Vortices on a Beta-Plane: A Brief Review and Recent Results
SO PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
AB Purpose. This paper briefly reviews the theory of singular vortices (SV) on a beta-plane.
   Methods and Results: The primary focus of the paper is on a long-term evolution of an individual SV: the governing equations and integrals of motion are given, the algorithm of numerical implementation of these equations for investigation of such an evolution is described, and the results of some numerical experiments are presented. It is shown that the vortex evolution consists of two stages. At an initial (quasi-linear) stage, the near-field radiation of Rossby waves by the vortex produces, near the vortex, a non-stationary secondary dipole - the beta-gyres - which forces the vortex to move (a cyclone drifts northwestward, an anticyclone - southwestward). At the next (nonlinear) stage, the far-field radiation of Rossby waves and self-interactions within the regular component of the motion become of importance. A singular cyclone (anticyclone) migrates slowly into the anticyclonic (cyclonic) beta-gyre; the SV and the beta-gyre form a compact vortex pair which continues to move northwestward (southwestward). As this process takes place, the cyclonic (anticyclonic) beta-gyre gradually drifts away from and ceases to affect the SV, while the SV starts to interact with the Rossby waves it radiated previously, which results in oscillations of its translation speed. The duration of the quasi-linear stage rapidly increases with an increasing intensity of the SV; for vortices of small or moderate intensity, this stage ends rapidly and gives way to the nonlinear stage. The first phenomenological description of the nonlinear stage of a singular monopole's evolution appeared in our recent work on the dynamics of the SV on a beta-plane.
   Conclusions: The theory of singular vortices on a beta-plane developed here significantly broadens our understanding of the evolution and dynamics of localized geophysical vortices which play an important role in the large-scale circulation of the ocean and atmosphere.

TI PTPN11 (SHP2) Is Indispensable for Growth Factors and Cytokine Signal
   Transduction During Bovine Oocyte Maturation and Blastocyst Development
SO CELLS
AB This study was aimed to investigate the role of SHP2 (Src-homology-2-containing phosphotyrosine phosphatase) in intricate signaling networks invoked by bovine oocyte to achieve maturation and blastocyst development. PTPN11 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, non-receptor type 11) encoding protein SHP2, a positive transducer of RTKs (Receptor Tyrosine Kinases) and cytokine receptors, can play a significant role in bovine oocyte maturation and embryo development, but this phenomenon has not yet been explored. Here, we used different growth factors, cytokines, selective activator, and a specific inhibitor of SHP2 to ascertain its role in bovine oocyte developmental stages in vitro. We found that SHP2 became activated by growth factors and cytokines treatment and was highly involved in the activation of oocyte maturation and embryo development pathways. Activation of SHP2 triggered MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinases) and PI3K/AKT (Phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Protein kinase B) signaling cascades, which is not only important for GVBD (germinal vesical breakdown) induction but also for maternal mRNA translation. Inhibition of phosphatase activity of SHP2 with PHPS1 (Phenylhydrazonopyrazolone sulfonate 1) reduced oocytes maturation as well as bovine blastocyst ICM (inner cell mass) volume. Supplementation of LIF (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor) to embryos showed an unconventional direct relation between p-SHP2 and p-STAT3 (Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) for blastocyst ICM development. Other than growth factors and cytokines, cisplatin was used to activate SHP2. Cisplatin activated SHP2 modulate growth factors effect and combine treatment significantly enhanced quality and rate of developed blastocysts.

TI Role of pyroptosis in cancer and its therapeutic regulation
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
AB Pyroptosis is mainly considered a gasdermin-regulated cell death mechanism characterized by cellular lysis and the release of several pro-inflammatory factors. Nowadays, pyroptosis has notably been gained extensive attention from clinicians and researchers. However, current studies report that downregulation of pyroptosismediated cell death plays a significant role in developing multiple cancers. Increasing studies also suggest that pyroptosis can impact all stages of carcinogenesis. Inducing pyroptotic cellular death could be a promising therapeutic option for managing and regulating multiple cancers in the near future. Our current review highlights the molecular and morphological features of pyroptosis and its potential roles in various cancers. In addition, we have also highlighted the biological characteristics and significances of GSDMD and GSDME and their critical functions in cancer progression, management and regulation.

TI Prospero Humiliated: Protestant Theology in The Tempest
SO SHAKESPEARE
AB The storm that opens Shakespeare's The Tempest is natural by all accounts until the start of the second scene. The Master, the Boatswain, and all the cast and crew aboard King Alonso's ship battle against what appear to be natural forces, real movements of the sky and the sea. As is revealed in the second scene, however, reality is not always what it seems. Shakespeare's cunning turn of natural to supernatural sets the stage for a play that will dive deep into the foaming, seething waves of England's seventeenth-century religious debate. The complexity of Prospero's character is at the heart of this play, and the magician's power, his humiliation and his redemption are the subjects of this article. The understanding of redemption that I will operate under has been drawn from Reformation theology, and while I draw from John Calvin and William Perkins at times, I take an especially close look at the writing of Martin Luther. Martin Luther's understanding of theology, his phraseology, his favourite metaphors, and his translation and accompanying interpretation of the gospel were accessible to the people of Shakespeare's England. While I do not seek to prove that Shakespeare is a Lutheran or that he has an affinity for Luther's doctrine, I am convinced that a careful study of The Tempest will reveal that Luther's ogospel for the masseso, and particularly Luther's understanding of Christian redemption, are worked out within the conflict of the play.

TI Silencing of GRA10 protein expression inhibits Toxoplasma gondii
   intracellular growth and development
SO PARASITOLOGY INTERNATIONAL
AB Toxoplasma gondii dense granule proteins (GRAs) are secreted abundantly in both the tachyzoite and bradyzoite stages of the parasite and are known to localize to various compartments of the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) that interfaces with the host cell milieu. Thus, GRAs may play significant roles in the biogenesis of the PV that is important for survival of intracellular T. gondii. GRA10 is a dense granule protein whose role in T. gondii has not yet been characterized. Therefore, in this study, we endeavored to determine the role of GRA10 in the growth and survival of intracellular T. gondii by using phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PPMOs) antisense knockdown approach to disrupt the translation of GRA10 mRNA in the parasites. We expressed and purified a truncated recombinant GRA10 protein to generate anti-GRA10 polyclonal antibodies that we used to characterize GRA10 in T. gondii. We found that GRA10 is a soluble, dense granule-associated protein that is secreted into the parasite cytosol and the parasitophorous vacuole milieu. Using in vitro cultures, we found that knockdown of GRA10 results in severe inhibition of T. gondii growth in human fibroblasts and in ovine monocytic cells. Together, our findings define GRA10 as a dense granule protein that plays a significant role in the growth and propagation of intracellular T. gondii in human fibroblasts and in ovine monocytic cells.

TI Stepan Razin and the Persian Princess: Origins and Fortunes of a Legend
SO JAHRBUCHER FUR GESCHICHTE OSTEUROPAS
AB The focal point of the Razin mythology in Russian culture is undoubtedly his killing of a captive Persian princess by drowning her in the Volga River. The legend most likely originated in 1668 in Cossack folklore. In Ludvig Fabritius' version, it was based on rumours about the ritual sacrifice of a young woman Ca high-born Tatar girl') to the river spirit. After Razin's Persian campaign in 1668-69, the Tatar girl was replaced by a Persian princess, according to Jan Janszoon Struys' version. Later, this legend converged with similar folk ballads and with the folk drama Lodka (The Boat). It did not survive in its complete form; by the mid-19th century there were only traces of it left in Russian folklore. Its subsequent popularity was due to Struys' written account from 1676, which inspired countless remouldings in prose and poetry, theatre and cinema, in painting, sculpture and music. Thanks to the popular song.k-a ostrova na str4en' (From the Shade of the Island into the Current Stream) based on Dmitri Sadovnikov's 1883 poem the legend returned into oral tradition and began to influence 'original' folk memories of Razin's rebellion.
   Two aspects of the story deserve special attention. First, the legend several times crossed and re-crossed the borders of oral and written literature. Second, it presents a striking case of ethno-cultural exchange. In the beginning, a Russian folk legend was first written down in Dutch, then the text saw several translations into French, and these translations, which were often commented and augmented, brought the story back to Russia, where it became part of literary tradition. Later on, some of the poems based on this plot, most of all Sadovnikov's version, were re-absorbed into folk tradition and acquired new details and twists, which again were used by professional writers.

TI Stress Granules in the Anti-Cancer Medications Mechanism of Action: A
   Systematic Scoping Review
SO FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
AB Stress granule (SG) formation is a well-known cellular mechanism for minimizing stress-related damage and increasing cell survival. In addition to playing a critical role in the stress response, SGs have emerged as critical mediators in human health. It seems logical that SGs play a key role in cancer cell formation, development, and metastasis. Recent studies have shown that many SG components contribute to the anti-cancer medications' responses through tumor-associated signaling pathways and other mechanisms. SG proteins are known for their involvement in the translation process, control of mRNA stability, and capacity to function in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. The current systematic review aimed to include all research on the impact of SGs on the mechanism of action of anti-cancer medications and was conducted using a six-stage methodological framework and the PRISMA guideline. Prior to October 2021, a systematic search of seven databases for eligible articles was performed. Following the review of the publications, the collected data were subjected to quantitative and qualitative analysis. Notably, Bortezomib, Sorafenib, Oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, Cisplatin, and Doxorubicin accounted for the majority of the medications examined in the studies. Overall, this systematic scoping review attempts to demonstrate and give a complete overview of the function of SGs in the mechanism of action of anti-cancer medications by evaluating all research.

TI 'Walking the boundaries': Lynne Parker's unpublished version of Federico
   Garcia Lorca's La Casa de Bernarda Alba
SO STUDIES IN THEATRE AND PERFORMANCE
AB Crossing the frontiers looking for inspiration has been part of the Irish literary tradition, and translation and adaptation of continental writers such as Federico Garcia Lorca have played an important role. The dissenting Lorquian voices revive in Ireland to find new meanings for the silences of the original play. This article explores an unpublished version of La Casa de Bernarda Alba, by Lynne Parker (The House of Bernarda Alba, 1993). The study will first review the relationship between Irish theatre and continental drama by the end of the twentieth century, to address its internationalization as well as the relationship between the North and the South; after this, the contexts of (re)creation of the play will be analyzed, with a special interest in the situation of women in society in the Spain of Lorca and the Belfast of Parker. The study will include a revision of the process of Hibernization Parker carried out from the English version she used as a source. Furthermore, an interview with the playwright will be used to illustrate some points. Conclusions aim at recognizing the play as an act of linguistic acculturation and appropriation and as part of the canon of Irish rewritings of Lorca.

TI Spectacles of sexuality: Televisionary activism in Nicaragua
SO CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY
AB This article develops the concept of "televisionary" activism-a mediated form of social justice messaging that attempts to transform culture. Focusing on a locally produced and very popular television show in Nicaragua, I consider how social justice knowledge is produced through television characters' scripting and performance. The ideological underpinnings aspire to a dialogic engagement with the audience, as producers aim to both generate public discourse and benefit from audiences' suggestions and active engagement. Several levels of media advocacy interventions are considered including the production, scripting, and translation of transnational material into local registers. Televisionary activism offers challenges to several conservative social values in Nicaragua by placing topics such as abortion, domestic violence, sexual abuse, homosexuality, and lesbianism very explicitly into the public sphere. At the same time, sexual subjects on the small screen must be framed in particular ways, as, for instance, with the homosexual subjects who are carefully coiffed in normalized human dramas. Finally, many of these televisionary tactics draw from and engage with transnational tropes of identity politics, and "gay" and "lesbian" subjectivity in particular, confounding the relationship between real and idealized sexual subjects in Nicaragua. That is, these televisionary tactics "market" transnational identity politics but derive legitimacy through their very "localness.".

TI Multiliteracies and the teaching of literature in English in a Distance
   Learning course
SO LINGUAS & LETRAS
AB The aim of this paper is to present and discuss a proposal of teaching of literature in English through the analysis of a didactic book, which was organized in 2014 for a "Letras" Course in Distance Education, as well as the students' comments on the Moodle platform. The book contemplates the main literary genres (poetry, short story, drama and novel) and examples of literary texts of these genres expanded to other media, such as songs, adaptations/translations, soap operas and films. In addition to this, there are suggestions of activities for the literary text in basic education and issues concerning teacher's critical thinking based on the multiliteracies pedagogy. Despite the fact that there is no subject about literature in English in Brazilian regular schools, all this material cannot be ignored in a language classroom, once it can contribute to a creative and critical development of our students. This discussion may help teachers reflect on the teaching of literature through other media (not only the written book) in a system of education that is still climbing steps to overcome geographic, political, cultural and social obstacles -Distance Education in Brazil. The theoretical framework is based on the concepts of multiliteracies (COPE, B; KALANTZIS, M., 2000), multimodality (KRESS, 2000) and Distance Education (MOORE, 2002).

TI Nineteenth-Century Sentimental and Popular Trends and their
   Transformation in Fin-de-siecle Latvian Literature
SO INTERLITTERARIA
AB In this paper, the role of popular culture in fin-de-siecle Latvian literature has been explored by analysing the mid-nineteenth century Latvian translation of Christoph Schmid's novel Genoveva (1846) by Ansis Leitans, and unfinished drama Genoveva (1908) by Rudolfs Blaumanis. While the first version of the Genoveva story was created according to the patterns of popular literature and played a significant role in the development of the Latvian reading public, the author of the second version attempted to turn the plot of popular fiction into a work of elite literature, elaborating the issue of female agency and adding psychological ambiguity to the plot. The mixture of popular melodramatic imagination and modernist themes, as observed in Blaumanis's work, provides a deeper insight into fin-de-siecle literary techniques by turning attention to the conscious use of different literary styles and narrative levels and illuminating interactions between popular and elite culture. By comparing both works and interpreting their aesthetic innovations in terms of the relationship between idealism, realism and modernism, this paper traces the ways in which fin-de-siecle Latvian literature appropriated and reworked models of popular culture and developed new aesthetic insights by merging elements of low and high culture.

TI Kierkegaard and the Copenhagen Production of Mozart's Don Giovanni
SO EUROPEAN ROMANTIC REVIEW
AB The article explores the early performance history of Mozart's Don Giovanni (1787) at Copenhagen's Royal Theatre, as a context for Soren Kierkegaard's famous essay on the opera, which appeared in his philosophical work Either/Or: A Fragment of Life (1843). Focusing on the treatment of the supernatural elements in the opera, the author examines Lauritz Kruse's Danish singspiel translation of the libretto, which was used by the theater from 1807 to 1839. Kruse turned Lorenzo Da Ponte's enlightened comedy of manners into a romantic tragedy with religious overtones, but his radical reconceptualization of the drama conflicted with the portrayal of the title role by the Danish-Italian baritone Giovanni Battista Cetti who was the Don Giovanni of Copenhagen's Royal Theatre from 1822 to 1837, and who partly inspired Kierkegaard's interpretation. Cetti performed the role as a charming and sympathetic character, probably due to the influence of his teacher Giuseppe Siboni who, in his turn, was probably influenced by Luigi Bassi's portrayal, the singer for whom Mozart had written the role. Hence the responses of Kierkegaard and other contemporary writers to Mozart's seducer may be read as attempts to find meaning in a dramaturgically incongruous production.

TI Convex multiclass segmentation with shearlet regularization
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER MATHEMATICS
AB Segmentation plays an important role in many preprocessing stages in image processing. Recently, convex relaxation methods for image multi-labelling were proposed in the literature. Often these models involve the total variation (TV) semi-norm as regularizing term. However, it is well known that the TV-functional is not optimal for the segmentation of textured regions. In recent years, directional representation systems were proposed to cope with curved singularities in images. In particular, curvelets and shearlets provide an optimally sparse approximation in the class of piecewise smooth functions with C 2 singularity boundaries. In this paper, we demonstrate that the discrete shearlet transform is suited as regularizer for the segmentation of curved structures. Neither the shearlet nor the curvelet transform where used as regularizer in a segmentation model so far. To this end, we have implemented a translation invariant finite discrete shearlet transform based on the fast Fourier transform. We describe how the shearlet transform can be incorporated within the multi-label segmentation model and show how to find a minimizer of the corresponding functional by applying an alternating direction method of multipliers. Here, the Parseval frame property of our shearlets comes into play. We demonstrate by numerical examples that the shearlet-regularized model can better segment curved textures than the TV-regularized one and that the method can also cope with regularizers obtained from non-local means.

TI Faith in formaldehyde: conversion in the oldest cabinet of curiosity in
   the Philippines
SO SOUTH EAST ASIA RESEARCH
AB This paper examines the oldest existing museum in the Philippines, the University of Santo Tomas Museum of Arts and Sciences, as a cabinet of curiosity and a catalyst of conversion. By Spanish royal decree, its early collection acquired through colonial expeditions, complex evangelical networks and commercial expositions formed the classroom materials for the Natural History course taught by Dominican friars. By 1877, the fauna, flora and mineral collections - from the minute to the monumental, from the ordinary to the odd - were inventoried in a three-volume catalogue raisonne. Its collection has since elicited a sense of wonder in nature's perfection and diversity. Within the broader philosophical contexts of natural and revealed theology and the revival of Thomism after Charles Darwin's publication of his theory of evolution through natural selection, the museum's pursuit of scientific knowledge masked its pursuit of sacred truth, engendering an epiphany through the embalmed and serving the divine through the drama of its dioramas. Operating as a mode of signification and translation of the Word, the museum became a biblical exegesis of the origin of species to archive God, preserving faith in formaldehyde as a means of maintaining the authority of the Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines.

TI Translating Yingxi: Chinese film genealogy and early cinema in Hong Kong
SO JOURNAL OF CHINESE CINEMAS
AB The essay targets the concept of yingxi and its translation, "shadowplay," in prevailing histories of Chinese cinema. Yingxi, a popular Chinese term used for motion pictures between 1897 and 1910s, has been translated as "shadowplay" in English language literature. By translating yingxi as "shadowplay," scholars have presumed and forged a link between early cinema and traditional artforms like shadow puppetry, or Peking opera. However, little evidence has been produced to link yingxi (motion pictures) with shadow puppetry, or Peking opera in terms of production, exhibition and reception. This de-stabilizes the equation made between yingxi and "shadowplay." Furthermore, based on new evidence recently recovered on early film exhibition in Hong Kong (1900-1924), we found yinghua (photo pictures) was used more frequently than yingxi, indicating the early reception of cinema was more fluid than what has been prescribed by the yingxi concept. Following yinghua, we discovered that the film screenings in colonial Hong Kong of the 1910s and 1920s were multifaceted events serving various functions, ranging from missionary talks to fund raising and enjoyment of the theatre space. The discovery urges us to look beyond the standard film historiography in the early Republican period, as prescribed by the "drama-centered" yingxi concept and its attendant spatial setup in opera theatres and teahouses.

TI Comparison of intestinal flora between patients with chronic and
   advanced Schistosoma japonicum infection
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB Background: Schistosoma japonicum infection is an important public health problem, imposing heavy social and economic burdens in 78 countries worldwide. However, the mechanism of transition from chronic to advanced S. japonicum infection remains largely unknown. Evidences suggested that gut microbiota plays a role in the pathogenesis of S. japonicum infection. However, the composition of the gut microbiota in patients with chronic and advanced S. japonicum infection is not well defined. In this study, we compared the composition of the intestinal flora in patients with chronic and advanced S. japonicum infection.
   Methods: The feces of 24 patients with chronic S. japonicum infection and five patients with advanced S. japonicum infection from the same area were collected according to standard procedures, and 16S rRNA sequencing technology was used to analyze the intestinal microbial composition of the two groups of patients.
   Results: We found that alteration occurs in the gut microbiota between the groups of patients with chronic and advanced S. japonicum infections. Analysis of alpha and beta diversity indicated that the diversity and abundance of intestinal flora in patients with advanced S. japonicum infection were lower than those in patients with chronic S. japonicum infection. Furthermore, Prevotella 9, Subdoligranulum, Ruminococcus torques, Megamonas and Fusicatenibacter seemed to have potential to discriminate different stages of S. japonicum infection and to act as biomarkers for diagnosis. Function prediction analysis revealed that microbiota function in the chronic group was focused on translation and cell growth and death, while that in the advanced group was concentrated on elevating metabolism-related functions.
   Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that alteration in gut microbiota in different stages of S. japonicum infection plays a potential role in the pathogenesis of transition from chronic to advanced S. japonicum infection. However, further validation in the clinic is needed, and the underlying mechanism requires further study.

TI Environmental Health Sciences in a Translational Research Framework:
   More than Benches and Bedsides
SO ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
AB BACKGROUND: Environmental health scientists may find it challenging to fit the structure of the questions addressed in their discipline into the prevailing paradigm for translational research.
   OBJECTIVE: We aim to frame the translational science paradigm to address the stages of scientific discovery, knowledge acquisition, policy development, and evaluation in a manner relevant to the environmental health sciences. Our intention is to characterize differences between environmental health sciences and clinical medicine, and to orient this effort towards public health goals.
   DISCUSSION: Translational research is usually understood to have evolved from the bench-to-bedside framework by which basic science transitions to clinical treatment. Although many health-related fields have incorporated the terminology and context of translational science, environmental health research has not always found a clear fit into this paradigm. We describe a translational research framework applicable to environmental health sciences that retains the basic structure that underlies the original bench-to-bedside paradigm. We propose that scientific discovery (T1) in environmental health research frequently occurs through epidemiological or clinical observations. This discovery often involves understanding the potential for human health effects of exposure to a given environmental chemical or chemicals. The practical applications of this discovery evolve through an understanding of exposure-response relationships (T2) and identification of potential interventions to reduce exposure and improve health (T3). These stages of translation require an interdisciplinary partnership between exposure sciences, exposure biology, toxicology, epidemiology, biostatistics, risk assessment, and clinical sciences. Implementation science then plays a crucial role in the development of environmental and public health practice and policy interventions (T4). Outcome evaluation (T5) often takes the form of accountability research, as environmental health scientists work to quantify the costs and benefits of these interventions.
   CONCLUSION: We propose an easily visualized framework for translation of environmental health science knowledge-from discovery to public health practice-that reflects the crucial interactions between multiple disciplines in our field.

TI Differential Regulation of Kit Ligand A Expression in the Ovary by IGF-I
   via Different Pathways
SO MOLECULAR ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Kit ligand (KITL) plays indispensable roles both in primordial follicle activation and in the maintenance of meiotic arrest of the oocyte. The regulation of KITL expression in the ovary, however, remains largely unknown. In the zebrafish, there are 2 paralogues of KITL, kitlga and kitlgb, and 2 Kit receptors, kita and kitb. Consistent with the situation in mammals, kitlga is only expressed in the ovarian follicle cells, and its cognate receptor kita is expressed in the oocyte. In the present study, we demonstrated that the expression of kitlga was promoted by IGF-I through its receptor IGF-IR. The stimulation involved transcription but not translation, suggesting that the kitlga gene is likely a direct downstream target of IGF-I signaling. Further experiments showed that the stimulatory effect of IGF-I was mediated by phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway. IGF-I also activated MEK-ERK pathway; however, this pathway suppressed kitlga expression. The regulation of kitlga expression by IGF-I appeared to depend on the stage of follicle development with a greater induction at early stage than late stage. This may be related to changes in IGF-I signaling pathways and/or local paracrine environment. In support of this were the differential expression of IGF-I receptors (igf1ra and igf1rb) and responsiveness of IGF-I signaling pathways, especially the PI3K-Akt pathway. Furthermore, the IGF-I-induced kitlga expression was inhibited by epidermal growth factor, an oocyte-derived paracrine factor in the zebrafish follicle. This study provides evidence for a controlling mechanism underlying the regulation of KITL expression in the ovary.

TI The Complete Works of World Literature (Sekai Bungaku Zenshu,1927-1932)
   by Shinchosha publishing house in the context of the history of Japanese
   book
SO JAPANESE STUDIES IN RUSSIA
AB The last years of the 1920s and the beginning of the 1930s are known as the "era of one-yen books" in the history of Japanese book printing. One-yen books were serial subscription publications, with the price of one yen per volume. The first such publication was the Complete Works of Contemporary Japanese Literature (Kindai Nihon Bungaku Zenshu), launched by Kaizosha publishing house in 1926. The series was very successful with at least 250,000 subscribers. The "one-yen editions race" was initiated: many publishing houses began releasing their own one-yen series as early as the following year. The most commercially successful among the one-yen books (at least 400,000 copies) was the Complete Works of World Literature (Sekai bungaku zenshu) published by the Shinchosha publishing house in 1927-1932.The Complete Works of World Literature consists of 57 volumes in two parts (38 volumes of the first part were published in 1927-1930, and then more 19 volumes were added, composing the second part of the publication). The books of the series had a hard cover and a thought-out design and were supposed to serve not only for reading, but also for the decoration of the house and the demonstration of the owner's status. The series represents one of the possible canons of world literature. The time frame of the presented works is from the 14th century (the first volume is Dante's Divine comedy) to the present (the last volume contains six works, five of them written in the 1920s, while the volume was released in 1929).The series includes prose, drama, and, to a lesser extent, poetry. The volumes of the series have a fairly extensive apparatus (prefaces, comments in some volumes, portraits of authors, monthly attachments tucked into the pages of the volumes). World literature is presented as Western literature. Translations of the works of Western literature played an important role in the formation of national Japanese literature. The success of this series also demonstrated the readers' great interest in literary translations, especially in the translations of modern literature.

TI Protein expression of eIF4E and integrin alpha v beta 6 in colon cancer
   can predict clinical significance, reveal their correlation and imply
   possible mechanism of interaction
SO CELL AND BIOSCIENCE
AB Background: Both eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and integrin alpha v beta 6 play an important role in the development and progression of cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of eIF4E and Integrin alpha v beta 6, their clinical significance as well as the two proteins' correlation in colonic carcinoma tissues.
   Results: The expression levels of eIF4E and integrin alpha v beta 6 were analyzed in colon cancerous and paraneoplastic tissues of 138 cases via tissue microarray (TMA)-immunohistochemistry. And their clinical significance as well as the two proteins' correlation was also investigated. The expression of eIF4E was significantly associated with clinical TNM stage (P = 0.009), while T stage (P = 0.011) and TNM stage (P = 0.012) were significantly associated with integrin alpha v beta 6 expression. Moderately weak correlation exists between the two proteins (r = 0.299, P < 0.001). The survival analysis by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression model showed that protein expression of high eIF4E and positive integrin alpha v beta 6, as independent prognostic factors (RR = 2.417, P = 0.001 and RR = 2.393, P = 0.001), tended to have a significantly poorer 5-year survival rate (P = 0.013 and 0.025, respectively, the log-rank test).
   Conclusion: eIF4E and Integrin alpha v beta 6 were indicators of tumor's progression and poor prognosis of patients with colon cancer. And the potential signaling loop involving them may provide a helpful therapeutic target in prevention and treatment of colon cancer.

TI The relationship between Insulin-like Growth Factor 1, sex steroids and
   timing of the pubertal growth spurt
SO CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB ObjectiveProgress through puberty involves a complex hormonal cascade, but the individual contributions of hormones, particularly IGF-1, are unknown. We reanalysed Chard growth study data to explore the tempo of puberty based on changes in both height and hormone levels, using a novel method of growth curve analysis.
   Design and SubjectsSchoolboys (n=54) and girls (n=70) from Chard, Somerset, England, recruited in 1981 at age 8/9 and followed to age 16.
   MeasurementsEvery 6months, height and Tanner stages (genitalia, breast, pubic hair) were recorded, and in a subsample (24 boys, 27 girls), blood samples were taken. Serum IGF-1, testosterone (boys) and oestradiol (girls) were measured by radioimmunoassay. Individual growth curves for each outcome were analysed using variants of the super-imposition by translation and rotation (SITAR) method, which estimates a mean curve and subject-specific random effects corresponding to size, and age and magnitude of peak velocity.
   ResultsThe SITAR models fitted the data well, explaining 99%, 65%, 86% and 47% of variance for height, IGF-1, testosterone and oestradiol, respectively, and 69-88% for the Tanner stages. During puberty, the variables all increased steeply in value in individuals, the ages at peak velocity for the different variables being highly correlated, particularly for IGF-1 vs height (r=074 for girls, 092 for boys).
   ConclusionsIGF-1, like height, the sex steroids and Tanner stages, rises steeply in individuals during puberty, with the timings of the rises tightly synchronized within individuals. This suggests that IGF-1 may play an important role in determining the timing of puberty.

TI How Gabriel Harvey read tragedy*
SO RENAISSANCE STUDIES
AB In 1579, Gabriel Harvey bound together in a composite collection a surprising group of texts: an Italian grammar, an Italian translation of Terence's comedies, Lodovico Dolce's Italian rifacimenti of Euripides' Medea and Seneca's Thyestes, and Euripides' Hecuba and Iphigenia in Erasmus' Latin. The volume is now dispersed, but all its parts survive. This essay explores the story of this hitherto unknown artefact and what it reveals about Harvey's reading practices and his engagement with drama, especially Greek tragedy. Parsing the elaborate system of signs with which Harvey multifariously annotated these works, it argues that he read tragedies with an emphasis on situation and utterance rather than extractable sententiae, as has been suggested. Harvey probed local detail in the tragedies with attentiveness, and with an eye to recurring observations that revealed the 'thought' of these works. He was drawn especially to the political dimension of this 'thought'. Reading tragedies in juxtaposition, he became interested in their different exploration of rulers' obligation to rule by their people's consent. And he found Euripides' plays particularly endowed with political wisdom, no doubt partly because he believed that they had been co-authored by Euripides' mentor and Harvey's own icon of pragmatic wisdom, Socrates.

TI Transcriptomic Analysis of circRNAs and mRNAs Reveals a Complex
   Regulatory Network That Participate in Follicular Development in
   Chickens
SO FRONTIERS IN GENETICS
AB Follicular development plays a key role in poultry reproduction, affecting clutch traits and thus egg production. Follicular growth is determined by granulosa cells (GCs), theca cells (TCs), and oocyte at the transcription, translation, and secretion levels. With the development of bioinformatic and experimental techniques, non-coding RNAs have been shown to participate in many life events. In this study, we investigated the transcriptomes of GCs and TCs in three different physiological stages: small yellow follicle (SYF), smallest hierarchical follicle (F6), and largest hierarchical follicle (F1) stages. A differential expression (DE) analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and bioinformatic analyses were performed. A total of 18,016 novel circular RNAs (circRNAs) were detected in GCs and TCs, 8127 of which were abundantly expressed in both cell types. and more circRNAs were differentially expressed between GCs and TCs than mRNAs. Enrichment analysis showed that the DE transcripts were mainly involved in cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In the WGCNA analysis, we identified six specific modules that were related to the different cell types in different stages of development. A series of central hub genes, including MAPK1, CITED4, SOD2, STC1, MOS, GDF9, MDH1, CAPN2, and novel_circ0004730, were incorporated into a Cytoscape network. Notably, using both DE analysis and WGCNA, ESR1 was identified as a key gene during follicular development. Our results provide valuable information on the circRNAs involved in follicle development and identify potential genes for further research to determine their roles in the regulation of different biological processes during follicle growth.

TI Presence of homeobox gene of Anf class in Pacific lamprey Lethenteron
   camtschaticum confirms the hypothesis about the importance of emergence
   of Anf genes for the origin of telencephalon in vertebrate evolution
SO RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB The presence of a complex structured brain, the anterior department of which (telencephalon) has no analogues in other groups of animals, is a significant peculiarity of vertebrates (including the human). Previously, a vertebrate-specific monogenic class of homeobox genes Anf, which plays a key role in the development of telencephalon, was discovered in the Laboratory of Molecular Bases of Embryogenesis (Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences). Out of all vertebrates, the Anf genes were not found only in the members of the most ancient group of jawless fishes (modern lampreys and hagfish), while the telencephalon was described in these animals. According to the literature data, a branch leading to jawless fishes separated from common vertebrate stem at the earliest stages of the their evolution, and detection of the Anf genes in jawless fishes is important, since it could confirm the previous hypothesis that the origin of telencephalon in evolution was associated with the appearance of the homeobox Anf gene. In the present work, the Anf gene was for the first time described in the Pacific lamprey (Lethenteron camtschaticum), the pattern and dynamics of its expression were studied at early stages of the development of this lamprey species, and the translation of its full-size cDNA was conducted in a eukaryotic expression system (clawed frog embryos).

TI CPEB2 Is Necessary for Proper Porcine Meiotic Maturation and Embryonic
   Development
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB Oocyte meiotic maturation and embryogenesis are some of the most important physiological processes that occur in organisms, playing crucial roles in the preservation of life in all species. The post-transcriptional regulation of maternal messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNAs) and the post-translational regulation of proteins are critical in the control of oocyte maturation and early embryogenesis. Translational control affects the basic mechanism of protein synthesis, thus, knowledge of the key components included in this machinery is required in order to understand its regulation. Cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding proteins (CPEBs) bind to the 3-end of mRNAs to regulate their localization and translation and are necessary for proper development. In this study we examined the expression pattern of cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 2 (CPEB2) both on the mRNA (by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, qRT-PCR) and protein (by Western blotting, WB) level, as well as its localization during the meiotic maturation of porcine oocytes and early embryonic development by immunocytochemistry (ICC). For the elucidation of its functions, CPEB2 knockdown by double-strand RNA (dsRNA) was used. We discovered that CPEB2 is expressed during all stages of porcine meiotic maturation and embryonic development. Moreover, we found that it is necessary to enable a high percentage of oocytes to reach the metaphase II (MII) stage, as well as for the production of good-quality parthenogenetic blastocysts.

TI Differential Subcellular Localization of Leishmania Alba-Domain Proteins
   throughout the Parasite Development
SO PLOS ONE
AB Alba-domain proteins are RNA-binding proteins found in archaea and eukaryotes and recently studied in protozoan parasites where they play a role in the regulation of virulence factors and stage-specific proteins. This work describes in silico structural characterization, cellular localization and biochemical analyses of Alba-domain proteins in Leishmania infantum. We show that in contrast to other protozoa, Leishmania have two Alba-domain proteins, LiAlba1 and LiAlba3, representative of the Rpp20- and the Rpp25-like eukaryotic subfamilies, respectively, which share several sequence and structural similarities but also important differences with orthologs in other protozoa, especially in sequences targeted for post-translational modifications. LiAlba1 and LiAlba3 proteins form a complex interacting with other RNA-binding proteins, ribosomal subunits, and translation factors as supported by co-immunoprecipitation and sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis. A higher co-sedimentation of Alba proteins with ribosomal subunits was seen upon conditions of decreased translation, suggesting a role of these proteins in translational repression. The Leishmania Alba-domain proteins display differential cellular localization throughout the parasite development. In the insect promastigote stage, Alba proteins co-localize predominantly to the cytoplasm but they translocate to the nucleolus and the flagellum upon amastigote differentiation in the mammalian host and are found back to the cytoplasm once amastigote differentiation is completed. Heat-shock, a major signal of amastigote differentiation, triggers Alba translocation to the nucleolus and the flagellum. Purification of the Leishmania flagellum confirmed LiAlba3 enrichment in this organelle during amastigote differentiation. Moreover, partial characterization of the Leishmania flagellum proteome of promastigotes and differentiating amastigotes revealed the presence of other RNA-binding proteins, as well as differences in the flagellum composition between these two parasite lifestages. Shuttling of Alba-domain proteins between the cytoplasm and the nucleolus or the flagellum throughout the parasite life cycle suggests that these RNA-binding proteins participate in several distinct regulatory pathways controlling developmental gene expression in Leishmania.

TI Serpent or Half-Serpent? Bernhard Richel's Melusine and the Making of a
   Western European Icon
SO NEOPHILOLOGUS
AB This essay presents a much-needed exploration of the impact of the woodcuts of the first German Melusine edition on the iconography of the larger, Western European M,lusine tradition. Although the debt owed by printers of early German Melusine editions to Bernhard Richel's editio princeps has been acknowledged, the influence of Richel's images on the woodcuts of early editions printed in other languages-French, Castilian, Dutch, and English-as yet remains largely unexplored. By examining the impact of one of Richel's woodcuts in particular-that depicting Melusine's transformation into a half-serpent-this essay will trace how Richel's iconography came to play such an important role that his depiction of Melusine's hybrid body eventually became one of her defining and most recognisable characteristics. In so doing, it reveals a number of interesting transcultural connections between early M,lusine printers and the clever image-recycling strategies they employed. This case study will also give us valuable insight into the production and illustration of early printed books, as the cross-cultural reuse and copying of prototype images challenge modern ideas of coherence between text and image.

TI Coxsackievirus B3 induces crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis to
   benefit its release after replicating in autophagosomes through a
   mechanism involving caspase cleavage of autophagy-related proteins
SO INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION
AB Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is known to induce both autophagy and apoptosis, but whether a relationship exists between these processes upon infection, and whether and how they influence the viral life cycle are currently unknown. We observed here that while autophagosome formation increased in CVB3-infected HeLa cells at the early stage of infection, it decreased at the late stage of infection along with increased apoptosis. Examining whether a functional relationship existed between autophagy and apoptosis during CVB3 infection, we found that increasing levels of autophagy inhibited apoptosis and that some apoptotic proteins in the endogenous and exogenous apoptosis pathways played a role in the transition from autophagy to apoptosis by cleaving the autophagy-related proteins Beclin-1 and Atg5. However, the transcription and translation of full-length Atg5 and Beclin-1 also increased, which likely counteracted the cleavage effect in order to prevent cells from dying too early and to ensure that CVB3 replication was complete in the autophagosomes. Using pharmacological inducers and inhibitors of autophagy as well as inhibitors of apoptosis, we found that while CVB3 replication relied on the autophagosomes, its release from the cell depended on apoptosis. Therefore, autophagy and apoptosis are two important processes that interact with each other during CVB3 infection, promoting the CVB3 life cycle. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

TI A positron emission tomography imaging probe selectively targeting the
   BD1 bromodomain and extra-terminal domain
SO CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS
AB The two tandem bromodomains of BET (bromodomain and extraterminal domain) proteins (BD1 and BD2) may play distinct and critical roles in neurological diseases. To better understand the underlying mechanisms of the BD1 bromodomain and facilitate brain permeable domain-selective inhibitor development, we describe here the development of the first BET BD1 positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand [C-11]1a. Compound la was tested to possess potent binding affinities and good selectivity (> 20-fold over BD2) for BD1 bromodomains of BRD2 (K-d = 25 nM), BRD3 (K-d = 24 nM), and BRD4 (K-d = 19 nM). Physicochemical characterization of la indicated the brain permeability and specific binding. [C-11]1a was radiosynthesized in a good radiochemical yield (RCY: 25-30%) and molar activity (258 GBq mu mol(-1)). The PET imaging studies of [C-11]1a in mice showed moderate brain uptake (with peak SUV = 0.7) and binding specificity. Furthermore, [C-11]1a demonstrated translational potential in the non-human primate (NHP) PET imaging study, which sets the stage for clinical translation.

TI Treatment with an inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 9 or cathepsin K
   lengthens embryonic lower jaw bone
SO ORTHODONTICS & CRANIOFACIAL RESEARCH
AB Objectives: Skeletal malocclusions are common, and severe malocclusions are treated by invasive surgeries. Recently, jaw bone length has been shown to be developmentally controlled by osteoclasts. Our objective was to determine the effect of inhibiting osteoclast-secreted proteolytic enzymes on lower jaw bone length of avian embryos by pharmacologically inhibiting matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP9) or cathepsin K (CTSK).Methods: Quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) embryos were given a single dose of an inhibitor of MMP9 (iMMP9), an inhibitor CTSK (iCTSK), or vehicle at a developmental stage when bone deposition is beginning to occur. At a developmental stage when the viscerocranium is largely calcified, the heads were scanned via micro-computed tomography and reproducible landmarks were placed on 3D-reconstructed skulls; the landmark coordinates were used to quantify facial bone dimensions.Results: Approximately half of the quail given either iMMP9 or iCTSK demonstrated an overt lower jaw phenotype, characterized by longer lower jaw bones and a greater lower to upper jaw ratio than control embryos. Additionally, iMMP9-treated embryos exhibited a significant change in midface length and iCTSK-treated embryos had significant change in nasal bone length.Conclusion: MMP9 and CTSK play a role in osteoclast-mediated determination of lower jaw bone length. Pharmacological inhibition of MMP9 or CTSK may be a promising therapeutic alternative to surgery for treating skeletal jaw malocclusions, but more preclinical research is needed prior to clinical translation.

TI Advance of Immunoregulatory Mechanisms of Long Non-coding RNA
SO PROGRESS IN BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOPHYSICS
AB The expression of eukaryotic genes are regulated at multiple levels, including transcription, translation, post-translational modification. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are defined as non-protein coding transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that play extensive roles in regulation of gene expression. They usually interact with DNA, mRNA and protein to regulate histone modification, DNA methylation, transcription activation or inhibition, mRNA splicing. LncRNAs are poorly conserved throughout evolution between widely divergent species, while also express specifically in different cells, tissues and differential stages. It is preferred to conduct research on lncRNAs expressed in cells of immune system because the development and differentiation of immune cells are controlled by delicate and specified gene regulation. In addition, the research focused on the lncRNAs in immune system can provide more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of regulation on immune system and thus contribute to developing new treatment of immune related diseases. The topics of this article are the classification of non-coding RNA, their general molecular mechanisms, and the specific regulation mechanisms involved in T cells, B cells and innate immune cells and cytokines.

TI Targeting Endothelial Progenitor Cells in Cancer as a Novel Biomarker
   and Anti-Angiogenic Therapy
SO CURRENT STEM CELL RESEARCH & THERAPY
AB Tumoral angiogenesis is mainly an endothelial cell-mediated process, which has been largely demonstrated to take on a crucial role in tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. Thus, tumor-associated neovasculature represents a pivotal target in cancer therapy. Several mechanisms take part in the genesis of this pathological vasculature, most notably neoangiogenesis and postnatal vasculogenesis. These processes may also play a critical role in the resistance to anti-angiogenic agents, leading to tumor progression. In particular, vasculogenesis is mediated by endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which include cellular subpopulations with different functional capacities. EPCs are able to proliferate, migrate, and differentiate into mature endothelial cells (ECs) in response to tumor growth, promoting the "angiogenic switch" and, consequently, inducing the invasion and metastases of cancer cells. Therefore, vasculogenesis mediated by EPCs represents an intriguing therapeutic target, both in early and late stages of cancer progression, thereby working as potential landmark for synthesizing novel and more effective anti-angiogenic drugs. Here, we aim to focus and to summarize several biological features of EPCs and EPC-based therapeutic approach with potential translation in human clinical trials.

TI MiR-224 impairs adipocyte early differentiation and regulates fatty acid
   metabolism
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY & CELL BIOLOGY
AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small similar to 22 nucleotide regulatory RNAs that regulate the stability and translation of cognate messenger RNAs (mRNAs). MicroRNAs participate in the regulation of adipogenesis and identification of the full repertoire of MicroRNAs expressed in adipose tissue is likely to improve our understanding of adipose tissue growth and development significantly. In the present study, it is found that miR-224-5p abundance decreases first and then increases during adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells. And early growth response 2 (EGR2) and Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4) are direct targets of miR-224-5p. Further studies in mouse 3T3-L1 cell-line shows that miR-224-5p is a novel negative regulator of adipocyte differentiation through post-transcriptional regulation of early growth response 2 during early adipogenesis. Furthermore, miR-224-5p could regulate fatty acid metabolism through Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 at terminal differentiation. It indicates that miR-224 plays different roles on different stages of adipogenesis. Crown Copyright (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Mesenchymal stromal cell based therapies for the treatment of immune
   disorders: recent milestones and future challenges
SO EXPERT OPINION ON DRUG DELIVERY
AB Introduction: Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) present unique immunomodulatory properties that make them promising candidates for the treatment of inflammatory and immune disorders. MSC-mediated immunomodulation is a complex combination of mechanisms, in which the secretome plays a fundamental role. The plethora of bioactive molecules MSCs produce, such as indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) or prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), efficiently regulates innate and adaptive immunity. As a result, MSCs have been extensively employed in preclinical studies, leading to the conduction of multiple clinical trials. Areas covered: This review summarizes the effects of some of the key biomolecules in the MSC secretome and the advances in preclinical studies exploring the treatment of disorders including graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Further, late-stage clinical trials and the first MSC-based therapies that recently obtained regulatory approval are discussed. Expert opinion: Extensive research supports the potential of MSC-based immunomodulatory therapies. However, to establish the bases for clinical translation, the future of study lies in the standardization of protocols and in the development of strategies that boost the therapeutic properties of MSCs.

TI P.H. Pearse and Thomas MacDonagh: a literary friendship
SO IRISH STUDIES REVIEW
AB Tracing the relationship between P.H. [Patrick Henry] Pearse (1879-1916) and Thomas MacDonagh (1878-1916), this essay explores the impact their friendship had on their careers as writers and critics. Their work together in St Enda's, the school for boys founded by Pearse in 1908, provides a significant context for this exploration. There, while working with MacDonagh, Pearse made drama an important part of school life and started writing plays for public performance. Meanwhile, their collaboration in putting together the St. Enda's school journal, An Macaomh (1909-1913), helped to hone MacDonagh's skills as a literary critic and to prepare for his later editorial role at the Irish Review (1911-1914). Attention then turns to how MacDonagh's views on Irish literature and his translations from Old Irish influenced his friend's development as both a critic and poet. Paticular consideration is paid to "Mise eire", one of Pearse's best-known poems. Finally, similarities are considered between MacDonagh and the hero of The Wandering Hawk (1915-1916), Pearse's unfinished, English-language, school story for children. Taken together, these various investigations reveal that, despite differing temperaments and at times divergent approaches to Irish writing, Pearse and MacDonagh enjoyed a mutually stimulating friendship that impacted positively on their literary careers.

TI Regulatory Role of Cancer Microenvironment in Cancer Metabolism
SO PROGRESS IN BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOPHYSICS
AB Cell metabolism has been widely studied in cancer development since Otto Warburg's description of overwhelmed glycolysis in cancer cells in the 1920s. Accumulated evidence demonstrates that cancer cells upon hypoxia and nutrient stress could hijack and reprogram variously metabolic pathways, including anabolism and catabolism, to produce essential precursors for biomass synthesis to sustain cell survival and proliferation. In addition, metabolic alterations control cellular events at multiple levels such as transcription, epigenetics, translation and posttranslational modification, eventually play an essential role during cancer initiation and progression. Therefore, dysregulation of cancer metabolism has been generally recognized as one of the ten hallmarks of cancer. During last three decades, especially in the recent decade, studies on oncogenes, tumor suppressors, growth factor-associated signaling pathways, and cancer microenvironment, which sequentially take center stage of cancer biology research, reveal that the cancer metabolism is regulated by reciprocal interaction between cancer cells and surrounding microenvironment. Elucidating the function and mechanism of cancer microenvironment-mediated metabolism reprogramming will provide potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets and fundamentally improve diagnosis and prognosis of cancer patients.

TI Circular RNAs: An emerging type of RNA in cancer
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMMUNOPATHOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY
AB Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a novel type of widespread and diverse endogenous non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which are different from the linear RNAs, form a covalently closed continuous loop without 5' or 3' polarities. The majority of circRNAs are abundant, conserved and stable across different species, and exhibit tissue/developmental-stage-specific characteristics. They are generated primarily through a type of alternative RNA splicing called back-splicing, in which a downstream splice donor is joined to an upstream splice acceptor through splice skipping or direct splice. Recent studies have discovered circRNAs function as microRNA sponges, binding with RNA-associated proteins to form RNA-protein complexes and then regulating gene transcription and translation into polypeptides. Emerging evidence indicates that circRNAs play important roles in the regulation of the development and progression of multiple cancers by serving as potential diagnostic and predictive biomarkers involved in tumor growth and invasion and providing new strategies for cancer diagnosis and targeted therapy. In this review, we briefly delineate the diversity and characteristics of circRNAs and discuss the highlights of the biogenesis of circRNAs and their potential functions in tumor.

AB Turkish as spoken in the Netherlands (NL-Turkish) sounds "different" (unconventional) to Turkish speakers in Turkey (TR-Turkish). We claim that this is due to structural contact-induced change that is, however, located within specific lexically complex units copied from Dutch. This article investigates structural change in NL-Turkish through analyses of spoken corpora collected in the bilingual Turkish community in the Netherlands and in a monolingual community in Turkey. The analyses reveal that at the current stage of contact, NL-Turkish is not copying Dutch syntax as such, but rather translates lexically complex individual units into Turkish. Perceived semantic equivalence between Dutch units and their Turkish equivalents plays a crucial role in this translation process. Counter to expectations, the TR-Turkish data also contained unconventional units, though they differed in type, and were much less frequent than those in NL-Turkish. We conclude that synchronic variation in individual NL-Turkish units can contain the seeds of future syntactic change, which will only be visible after an increase in the type and token frequency of the changing units.

TI Prognostic value of Musashi 2 (MSI2) in cancer patients: A systematic
   review and meta-analysis
SO FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
AB Musashi 2 (MSI2) is an RNA-binding protein that regulates mRNA translation of numerous intracellular targets and plays an important role in the development of cancer. However, the prognostic value of MSI2 in various cancers remains controversial. Herein, we conducted this meta-analysis including 21 studies with 2640 patients searched from PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure databases, and WanFang databases to accurately assess the prognostic significance of MSI2 in various cancers. Our results indicated that high MSI2 expression was significantly related to poor overall survival (HR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.66-2.05, P < 0.001) and disease-free survival (HR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.35-2.22, P < 0.001). In addition, MSI2 positive expression was associated with certain phenotypes of tumor aggressiveness, such as clinical stage, depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis, liver metastasis and tumor size. In conclusion, elevated MSI2 expression is closely correlated with poor prognosis in various cancers, and may serve as a potential molecular target for cancer patients.

TI Mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of potential infectious
   bursal disease virus VP3-interacting proteins in chicken embryo
   fibroblasts cells
SO VIRUS GENES
AB The structural protein VP3 of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) plays a critical role in viral assembly, replication, immune escape, and anti-apoptosis. Interaction between VP3 and host protein factors can affect stages in the viral replication cycle. In this study, 137 host proteins interacting with VP3 protein were screened through liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based proteomics approach. The functions and relevance of the proteins were obtained through bioinformatics analysis. Most VP3-interacting proteins were linked to binding, catalytic activity, and structural molecular activity, and performed functions in cell parts and cells. Biological functions of VP3-interacting proteins were mainly relevant to "Cytoskeleton", "Translation", and "Signal transduction mechanisms", involving ribosomes, "Tight junction", regulation of actin cytoskeleton, and other pathways. Six potential VP3-interacting proteins in host cells were knocked down, and vimentin, myosin-9, and annexin A2 were found to be related to IBDV replication. This study would help explore regulatory pathways and cellular mechanisms in IBDV-infected cells, and also provided clues for the in-depth study of VP3 biological functions and IBDV replication or pathogenesis.

TI Decrease of RBM4 indicates poor prognosis in patients with
   hepatocellular carcinoma after hepatectomy
SO ONCOTARGETS AND THERAPY
AB RNA-binding motif 4 (RBM4) has been reported to play an important role in many human tumors such as lung cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer and gastric cancer by regulating alternative splicing and messenger RNA (mRNA) translation. However, little is known about the role of RBM4 in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to investigate the expression of RBM4 in HCC tissues. Expression of RBM4 was detected by immunohistochemistry in 95 cases of HCC. Correlations of RBM4 expression with the overall survival and disease-free survival of HCC were also studied. Patients with high RBM4 expression had better overall survival rate and disease-free survival rate than those with low RBM4 expression (P<0.001, P=0.007, respectively). RBM4 expression, together with tumor numbers, capsular formation, vascular invasion and Barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC) stage, was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival rate and disease-free survival rate of HCC. Our data implicate RBM4 as a novel prognostic marker and a potential therapeutic target for HCC.

TI Importance and implications of exosomes in nephrology and urology
SO PFLUGERS ARCHIV-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY
AB Exosomes are extracellular vesicles that are formed by two invaginations of the plasma membrane and can be released by all eukaryotic cells. Because of their bioactive contents, including nucleic acids and proteins, exosomes can activate a variety of functions in their recipient cells. Due to the plethora of physiological and pathophysiological functions, exosomes have received a lot of attention from researchers over the past few years. However, there is still no consensus regarding isolation and characterization protocols of exosomes and their subtypes. This heterogeneity poses a lot of methodical challenges but also offers new clinical opportunities simultaneously. So far, exosome-based research is still mostly limited to preclinical experiments and early-stage clinical trials since the translation of experimental findings remains difficult. Exosomes could potentially play an important role as future diagnostic and prognostic agents and might also be part of the development of new treatment strategies. Therefore, they have previously been investigated in a variety of nephrological and urological conditions such as acute kidney injury or prostate cancer.

TI Cross-cultural adaptation and psychometric assessment of a Persian
   version of Proctor's developmental vocal assessment protocol:
   Description of Persian infant vocal development
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY
AB Objectives: With increasing recognition of the importance of pre-linguistic vocalization, and early intervention for children, proper protocols play an important role in documenting infants' progress and effects of early interventional programs. This study aimed to translate Proctor's Developmental Vocal Assessment Protocol into Persian, make cultural adaptations, assess Persian version of Developmental Vocal Assessment Protocol (P-DVAP)'s validity, internal consistency, and reliability, and provide a general perspective toward Persian infants' vocal behaviors.
   Methods: This study was mainly conducted in reference to Beaton's guidelines included translation, synthesis, back-translation, expert committee review, & pretesting. Ten well-experienced speech and language therapists contributed in expert committee review. Mothers of 202 infants were interviewed by experienced speech and language therapists.
   Results: Expert committee pointed out some difficulties that parents might have responding to P-DVAP. Such difficulties were sorted out in the P-DVAP applied for psychometric analysis. The Content Validity Index and Content Validity Ratio of P-DVAP were above 0.9. In test-retest reliability, Kappa coefficient was 0.6 and as the measure of inter item consistency, Kuder-Richardson-20 for each stage ranged from 0.1 to 0.5. Parents of typical infants reported variations in crying, vegetative sounds, laughing, prosody changes, babbling, approximants of meaningful words, and consonant-vowel structures as the most common vocal behaviors. The number of vocal behaviors reported for preterm infants after corrected gestational age was fewer than those of typical full-term infants.
   Conclusion: The P-DVAP is a comprehensive, reliable, valid, simple and clear protocol for clinical evaluation of Persian infants' vocal behaviors.

TI Pressure-Controlled Structural Symmetry Transition in Layered InSe
SO LASER & PHOTONICS REVIEWS
AB Structural symmetry of crystals plays important roles regarding the physical properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials, particularly in the nonlinear optics regime. There has been a long-term exploration of the physical properties in 2D materials with various stacking structures, which correspond to different structural symmetries. Usually, the manipulation of rotational alignment between layers in 2D heterostructures is realized at the synthetic stage through artificial stacking like assembling building blocks. However, the reconfigurable control of translational symmetry of crystalline structure is still challenging. High pressure, as a powerful external control knob, provides a very promising route to circumvent this constraint. Here, a pressure-controlled symmetry transition in layered InSe is experimentally demonstrated. The continuous and reversible evolution of structural symmetries can be in situ monitored by using polarization-resolved second-harmonic-generation (SHG) spectroscopy. As pressure changes, the reconfigurable symmetry transition of the SHG pattern from threefold rotational symmetry to mirror symmetry is experimentally observed in layered InSe samples and successfully explained by the proposed interlayer-translation model. This opens new routes toward potential applications of manipulating crystal symmetry of 2D materials.

TI Differential regulation of mRNA fate by the human Ccr4-Not complex is
   driven by coding sequence composition and mRNA localization
SO GENOME BIOLOGY
AB Background: Regulation of protein output at the level of translation allows for a rapid adaptation to dynamic changes to the cell's requirements. This precise control of gene expression is achieved by complex and interlinked biochemical processes that modulate both the protein synthesis rate and stability of each individual mRNA. A major factor coordinating this regulation is the Ccr4-Not complex. Despite playing a role in most stages of the mRNA life cycle, no attempt has been made to take a global integrated view of how the Ccr4-Not complex affects gene expression.
   Results: This study has taken a comprehensive approach to investigate post-transcriptional regulation mediated by the Ccr4-Not complex assessing steady-state mRNA levels, ribosome position, mRNA stability, and protein production transcriptome-wide. Depletion of the scaffold protein CNOT1 results in a global upregulation of mRNA stability and the preferential stabilization of mRNAs enriched for G/C-ending codons. We also uncover that mRNAs targeted to the ER for their translation have reduced translational efficiency when CNOT1 is depleted, specifically downstream of the signal sequence cleavage site. In contrast, translationally upregulated mRNAs are normally localized in p-bodies, contain disorder-promoting amino acids, and encode nuclear localized proteins. Finally, we identify ribosome pause sites that are resolved or induced by the depletion of CNOT1.
   Conclusions: We define the key mRNA features that determine how the human Ccr4-Not complex differentially regulates mRNA fate and protein synthesis through a mechanism linked to codon composition, amino acid usage, and mRNA localization.

SO MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
AB Old age, repeat play and improper preservation always deteriorate the film, and dust and mechanical operations produce artifacts like scratches and blotches. Many researches carried out to repair the damaged digital videos and video inpainting gradually becomes an important topic in digital image process ing. Challenges in scratched video inpainting are automatic detection of scratches and restoration of damaged part. This paper presents an automatic scratch detec tion method as well as a novel scratch removal approach. Stationary wavelet transform (SWT) which shows excellent performance in keeping translation-invariant is introduced to automatically detect the scratches, this strategy makes the scratches' detection more accurate. At the heart of our method is a new nonlinear interpolation method based on continued fraction in which Thiele-type continued fraction is used to interpolate surrounding known pixels for repairing the damaged part. Algorithm presented in this paper also utilizes both spatial and temporal information of the scratched video during the restoration stage. Experimental results show that our scheme not only obtains more accurate detection of scratches, but also gives better video quality.

   suspension bioreactors
SO BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOENGINEERING
AB Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are a promising platform for regenerative medicine applications because of their multilineage differentiation abilities and ease of collection, isolation, and growth ex vivo. To meet the demand for clinical applications, large-scale manufacturing will be required using three-dimensional culture platforms in vessels such as stirred suspension bioreactors. As MSCs are an adherent cell type, microcarriers are added to the culture to increase the available surface area for attachment and growth. Although extensive research has been performed on efficiently culturing MSCs using microcarriers, challenges persist in downstream processing, including harvesting, filtration, and volume reduction, which all play a critical role in the translation of cell therapies to the clinic. The objective of this review is to assess the current state of downstream technologies available for microcarrier-based MSC cultures. This includes a review of current research within the three stages: harvesting, filtration, and volume reduction. Using this information, a downstream process for MSCs is proposed, which can be applied to a wide range of applications.

TI The role of m6A RNA methylation in cancer metabolism
SO MOLECULAR CANCER
AB Metabolic reprogramming is one of the main characteristics of malignant tumors, which is due to the flexible changes of cell metabolism that can meet the needs of cell growth and maintain the homeostasis of tissue environments. Cancer cells can obtain metabolic adaptation through a variety of endogenous and exogenous signaling pathways, which can not only promote the growth of malignant cancer cells, but also start the transformation process of cells to adapt to tumor microenvironment. Studies show that m6A RNA methylation is widely involved in the metabolic recombination of tumor cells. In eukaryotes, m6A methylation is the most abundant modification in mRNA, which is involved in almost all the RNA cycle stages, including regulation the transcription, maturation, translation, degradation and stability of mRNA. M6A RNA methylation can be involved in the regulation of physiological and pathological processes, including cancer. In this review, we discuss the role of m6A RNA methylation modification plays in tumor metabolism-related molecules and pathways, aiming to show the importance of targeting m6A in regulating tumor metabolism.

SO FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
AB The inability to effectively model sarcoidosis in the laboratory or in animals continues to hinder the discovery and translation of new, targeted treatments. The granuloma is the signature pathological hallmark of sarcoidosis, yet there are significant knowledge gaps that exist with regard to how granulomas form. Significant progress toward improved therapeutic and prognostic strategies in sarcoidosis hinges on tractable experimental models that recapitulate the process of granuloma formation in sarcoidosis and allow for mechanistic insights into the molecular events involved. Through its inherent representation of the complex genetics underpinning immune cell dysregulation in sarcoidosis, a recently developedin vitrohuman granuloma model holds promise in providing detailed mechanistic insight into sarcoidosis-specific disease regulating pathways at play during early stages of granuloma formation. The purpose of this review is to critically evaluate current sarcoidosis models and assess their potential to progress the field toward the goal of improved therapies in this disease. We conclude with the potential integrated use of preclinical models to accelerate progress toward identifying and testing new drugs and drug combinations that can be rapidly brought to clinical trials.

AB Background Among the various factors forming the environment, most developmentalists are in agreement that the home is the primary agent for change in child growth and development. The present study investigated the effect of affordances in the home on personal-social, problem-solving, and communication skills of children between 18 and 42 months of age. This investigation extends work focusing on "motor" affordances as an environmental feature. Methods Using cross-sectional design, 251 families (124 boys and 127 girls) were evaluated using the Persian translation ofAffordances in the Home Environment for Motor Developmentand theAges and Stages Inventoriesto determine the three skill competencies. Results Results showed that the level of home affordances significantly impacted all three skill areas. And the total variance of predictive values in the final model had a moderate and significant ratio. Other factors such as attendance and non-attendance of children in kindergarten, family income, and education of parents were also contributing factors. Conclusions In general, these findings indicate that the home environment plays an important role in the development of personal-social, problem-solving, and communication skills.

TI On ATG4B as Drug Target for Treatment of Solid Tumours-The Knowns and
   the Unknowns
SO CELLS
AB Autophagy is an evolutionary conserved stress survival pathway that has been shown to play an important role in the initiation, progression, and metastasis of multiple cancers; however, little progress has been made to date in translation of basic research to clinical application. This is partially due to an incomplete understanding of the role of autophagy in the different stages of cancer, and also to an incomplete assessment of potential drug targets in the autophagy pathway. While drug discovery efforts are on-going to target enzymes involved in the initiation phase of the autophagosome, e.g., unc51-like autophagy activating kinase (ULK)1/2, vacuolar protein sorting 34 (Vps34), and autophagy-related (ATG)7, we propose that the cysteine protease ATG4B is a bona fide drug target for the development of anti-cancer treatments. In this review, we highlight some of the recent advances in our understanding of the role of ATG4B in autophagy and its relevance to cancer, and perform a critical evaluation of ATG4B as a druggable cancer target.

   Results: We used RNA-seq and exploited the protracted development of the parasitic nematode Ascaris suum to provide a comprehensive time course of mRNA expression, degradation, and translation during early development. Surprisingly, we find that similar to 4,000 genes are transcribed prior to pronuclear fusion and in the one-to four-cell embryos. Intriguingly, we do not detect maternal contribution of many orthologs of maternal C. elegans mRNAs, but instead find that these are newly transcribed in the A. suum zygote prior to pronuclear fusion. Ribosome profiling demonstrates that, in general, early embryonic mRNAs are not stored for subsequent translation, but are directly translated after their synthesis. The role of maternally contributed and zygotically transcribed genes differs between the nematodes A. suum and C. elegans despite the fact that the two nematodes appear to exhibit highly similar morphological patterns during early development.
   Conclusions: Our study indicates that major transcription can occur immediately after fertilization and prior to pronuclear fusion in metazoa, suggesting that newly transcribed genes appear to drive A. suum early development. Furthermore, the mechanisms used for controlling the timing of the expression of key conserved genes has been altered between the two nematodes, illustrating significant plasticity in the regulatory networks that play important roles in developmental outcomes in nematodes.

TI Probing Dynamic Features of Phagosome Maturation in Macrophage using
   Au@MnOx@SiO2 Nanoparticles as pH-Sensitive Plasmonic Nanoprobes
SO CHEMISTRY-AN ASIAN JOURNAL
AB Phagosome maturation in macrophage is essential to the clearance of pathogenic materials in host defence but the dynamic features remain difficult to be measured in real time. Herein, we reported the multilayered Au@MnOx@SiO2 nanoparticle as a robust pH-sensitive plasmonic nanosensor for monitoring the dynamic acidification features over the phagosome maturation process in macrophage under darkfield microscopy. For this multilayered nanosensor, the gold nanoparticle core plays a role of signal reporter, the MnOx shell and the outmost SiO2 act as the sensing layer and the protecting layer, respectively. After subject to the acidic buffer solution, the MnOx layer in the multilayered nanoprobe could be decomposed rapidly, resulting in a remarkable spectral shift and color change under darkfield microscopy. We demonstrated this nanosensor for the investigation of single phagosome acidification dynamics by monitoring the color changes of nanoprobes after phagocytosis over time. The nanoprobes after phagocytosized in macrophage displayed a slight color change within the first hour and then cost several minutes to change from red to green in the next stage, indicating the phagosome undergoes a slow first and then fast acidification feature as well as a slow-to-fast acidification translation over the phagosome maturation process. Moreover, we validated that the slow-to-fast acidification translation was dependent on the activation of V-ATPase from the ATP depletion assay. We believed that this nanosensor is promising for studying the dynamic acidification features as well as disorders in phagosome maturation in phagocytic cells, which might provide valuable information for understanding the disease pathogenesis related to phagosome dysfunctions.

TI Dynamics of gene expression with positive feedback to histone
   modifications at bivalent domains
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS B
AB Experiments have shown that in embryonic stem cells, the promoters of many lineage control genes contain "bivalent domains", within which the nucleosomes possess both active (H3K4me3) and repressive (H3K27me3) marks. Such bivalent modifications play important roles in maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem cells. Here, to investigate gene expression dynamics when there are regulations in bivalent histone modifications and random partition in cell divisions, we study how positive feedback to histone methylation/demethylation controls the transition dynamics of the histone modification patterns along with cell cycles. We constructed a computational model that includes dynamics of histone marks, three-stage chromatin state transitions, transcription and translation, feedbacks from protein product to enzymes to regulate the addition and removal of histone marks, and the inheritance of nucleosome state between cell cycles. The model reveals how dynamics of both nucleosome state transition and gene expression are dependent on the enzyme activities and feedback regulations. Results show that the combination of stochastic histone modification at each cell division and the deterministic feedback regulation work together to adjust the dynamics of chromatin state transition in stem cell regenerations.

TI Mechanisms of Immune Tolerance in Liver Transplantation-Crosstalk
   Between Alloreactive T Cells and Liver Cells With Therapeutic Prospects
SO FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
AB Liver transplantation (LTx) is currently the most powerful treatment for end-stage liver disease. Although liver allograft is more tolerogenic compared to other solid organs, the majority of LTx recipients still require long-term immune suppression (IS) to control the undesired alloimmune responses, which can lead to severe side effects. Thus, understanding the mechanism of liver transplant tolerance and crosstalk between immune cells, especially alloreactive T cells and liver cells, can shed light on more specific tolerance induction strategies for future clinical translation. In this review, we focus on alloreactive T cell mediated immune responses and their crosstalk with liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and cholangiocytes in transplant setting. Liver cells mainly serve as antigen presenting cells (APCs) to T cells, but with low expression of co-stimulatory molecules. Crosstalk between them largely depends on the different expression of adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors. Inflammatory cytokines secreted by immune cells further elaborate this crosstalk and regulate the fate of naive T cells differentiation within the liver graft. On the other hand, regulatory T cells (Tregs) play an essential role in inducing and keeping immune tolerance in LTx. Tregs based adoptive cell therapy provides an excellent therapeutic option for clinical transplant tolerance induction. However, many questions regarding cell therapy still need to be solved. Here we also address the current clinical trials of adoptive Tregs therapy and other tolerance induction strategies in LTx, together with future challenges for clinical translation from bench to bedside.

TI "Ramayan Gaan" or Singing the Ramayan in West Bengal, Assam, and
   Bangladesh
SO ASIAN THEATRE JOURNAL
AB The Indian epic, the Ramayan, has been kept alive in the popular imagination in India, through various textual, oral, visual, and performance forms. While Ramlila is the most popular live performance form to enact the Ramayan in the Hindi-speaking regions of North India, Ramayan Gaan is the form that prevails in the Bengali-speaking regions of West Bengal and Assam in India, and in Bangladesh where the event is also called "Kushan Gaan" or "Kush's Song." While Ramlila is based chiefly on Tulsidas's Ramcaritmanas, Ramayan Gaan is indebted to Krittibas Ojha's slightly earlier Ramayan. This essay discusses salient features of Ramayan Gaan with occasional reference to Ramlila, illustrating some of their shared narrative and ideological elements as well as some of their critical disjunctures. It underscores the fact that in Bangladesh, a Muslim-majority country, Ramayan Gaan is enthusiastically performed and appreciated by Hindus and Muslims alike. This essay also charts the transitional zone, ontologically and geographically, where Ramlila meets Durga Puja in the eastern regions. Significantly, in Ramayan Gaan, Ram invokes Mahashakti (Durga) before his battle with the ten-headed Ravan, and Sita, in the form of Bhadra Kali, defeats the thousandheaded Ravan. Together, these narrative elements help explain the conjunction of Ramayan Gaan and Durga Puja in the Bengali-speaking regions.

TI (Re-)sources of innovation: Understanding and comparing time-spatial
   innovation dynamics through the lens of communities of practice
SO GEOFORUM
AB Communities of practice play an important role in innovation processes. It is, however, still unclear what their particular function is. In this article the authors seek first to develop further systematic differentiations between different types of knowing in practice to provide the conceptual ground for studying the influences of knowing in practice on innovation in a comparative way. Therefore, existing inductive approaches are complemented with deductive elements that highlight different impulses of reflexivity (push vs. pull) and different internal logics of reflexivity (rationalist vs. aesthetic). Second, in this article the authors introduce a dynamic approach which focuses on core ideas of innovation processes from a spatial perspective. In such a dynamic view types of knowing in practice have an impact as sources and resources of innovation. As sources of innovation they form a particular locus in which novel ideas emerge and subsequently take particular trajectories. As resources of innovation they intervene at subsequent stages of the process and propel further the translation process of a novel idea becoming eventually a valuable and practicable solution.

TI Regulation of voltage-gated sodium channel expression in cancer:
   hormones, growth factors and auto-regulation
SO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB Although ion channels are increasingly being discovered in cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, and shown to contribute to different aspects and stages of the cancer process, much less is known about the mechanisms controlling their expression. Here, we focus on voltage-gated Na+ channels (VGSCs) which are upregulated in many types of carcinomas where their activity potentiates cell behaviours integral to the metastatic cascade. Regulation of VGSCs occurs at a hierarchy of levels from transcription to post-translation. Importantly, mainstream cancer mechanisms, especially hormones and growth factors, play a significant role in the regulation. On the whole, in major hormone-sensitive cancers, such as breast and prostate cancer, there is a negative association between genomic steroid hormone sensitivity and functional VGSC expression. Activity-dependent regulation by positive feedback has been demonstrated in strongly metastatic cells whereby the VGSC is self-sustaining, with its activity promoting further functional channel expression. Such auto-regulation is unlike normal cells in which activity-dependent regulation occurs mostly via negative feedback. Throughout, we highlight the possible clinical implications of functional VGSC expression and regulation in cancer.

TI Horrible Imaginings: Jan Kott, the Grotesque, and Macbeth, Macbeth
SO MULTICULTURAL SHAKESPEARE-TRANSLATION APPROPRIATION AND PERFORMANCE
AB Throughout Jan Kott's Shakespeare Our Contemporary, a keyword for the combination of philosophical, aesthetic and modern qualities in Shakespearean drama is "grotesque." This term is also relevant to other influential studies of early-modern drama, notably Mikhail Bakhtin's idea of the carnivalesque, as well as Wolfgang Kayser's psychoanalytic criticism. Yet if this tradition of the Shakespearean grotesque has problematized an idea of the human and of humanist values in literature, can this also be understood in posthuman terms? This paper proposes a reading of Kott's criticism of the grotesque to suggest where it indicates a potential interrogation of the human and posthuman in Shakespeare, especially at points where the ideas of the grotesque or absurdity indicate other ideas of causation, agency or affect, such as the "grand mechanism" It will then argue for the continuing relevance of Kott's work by examining a recent work of Shakespearean adaptation as appropriation, the 2016 novel Macbeth, Macbeth by Ewan Fernie and Simon Palfrey which attempts a provocative and transgressive retelling of Macbeth that imagines a 'sequel' to the play that emphasises ideas of violence and ethics. The paper argues that this creative intervention should be best understood as a continuation of Kott's idea of the grotesque in Shakespeare, but from the vantage point of the twenty-first century in which the grotesque can be understood as the modification or even disappearance of the human. Overall, it is intended to show how the reconsideration of the grotesque may elaborate questions of being and subjectivity in our contemporary moment just as Kott's study reflected his position in the Cold War.

TI Heritage, Narrative and the Role of the Humanities in Populist Times
SO ENGLISH STUDIES IN AFRICA
AB At a time when populist rhetoric appears to have evacuated justice and ethics from public debates, I am interested in the extent to which our work as humanities scholars can contribute towards rebuilding viable public spheres, networks of solidarity, and - in the case of memorial sites - physical and imaginative spaces of encounter for audiences with diverse needs and interests. Focusing on Constitution Hill, a heritage precinct in the centre of Johannesburg, I examine what the humanities have to offer for the design of structured narrative environments on memorial sites, for the collaborative work between curators and witnesses, for the possibility of eliciting responsible forms of witnessing, and for the mass-mediated translation of heritage into popular culture. As experts in storytelling, do we have disciplinary and pedagogical toolkits that allow us to contribute to the reinvigoration of public spheres invested in fundamental processes of democracy and social justice, so as to counteract the relegation of ethical concerns '[to] the private space of the individual, to be enjoyed only at certain times in our day' (Temelkuran 120)?

TI Involvement of ribosomal protein L6 in assembly of functional 50S
   ribosomal subunit in Escherichia coli cells
SO BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
AB Ribosomal protein L6, an essential component of the large (50S) subunit, primarily binds to helix 97 of 23S rRNA and locates near the sarcin/ricin loop of helix 95 that directly interacts with GTPase translation factors. Although L6 is believed to play important roles in factor-dependent ribosomal function, crucial biochemical evidence for this hypothesis has not been obtained. We constructed and characterized an Escherichia coli mutant bearing a chromosomal L6 gene (TIE) disruption and carrying a plasmid with an arabinose-inducible L6 gene. Although this AL6 mutant grew more slowly than its wild-type parent, it proliferated in the presence of arabinose. Interestingly, cell growth in the absence of arabinose was biphasic. Early growth lasted only a few generations (LI-phase) and was followed by a suspension of growth for several hours (S-phase). This suspension was followed by a second growth phase (LII-phase). Cells harvested at both LI- and S-phases contained ribosomes with reduced factor -dependent GTPase activity and accumulated 50S subunit precursors (45S particles). The 45S particles completely lacked L6. Complete 50S subunits containing L6 were observed in all growth phases regardless of the L6-depleted condition, implying that the Delta L6 mutant escaped death because of a leaky expression of L6 from the complementing plasmid. We conclude that L6 is essential for the assembly of functional 50S subunits at the late stage. We thus established conditions for the isolation of L6 -depleted 50S subunits, which are essential to study the role of L6 in translation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Association of polymorphisms in MALAT1 with the risk of endometrial
   cancer in Southern Chinese women
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL LABORATORY ANALYSIS
AB Background Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy worldwide. Polymorphisms in MALAT1 have been demonstrated to play critical roles in cancer. However, the roles of MALAT1 polymorphisms in the etiology of endometrial cancer have not been well documented. Methods We genotyped three MALAT1 polymorphisms in 249 endometrial cancer cases and 446 cancer-free female controls using quantitative polymerase chain reaction with TaqMan probes. To estimate the association between MALAT1 polymorphisms (rs591291 C>T, rs664589 C>G, and rs4102217 G>C) and the risk of endometrial cancer, an unconditional logistic regression model was conducted to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI), adjusting for surgery history, menopause, number of deliveries, BMI, and FIGO stage. Results We found that the MALAT1 rs664589 C>G polymorphism was significantly associated with endometrial cancer risk (heterogeneous: adjusted OR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.34-0.93, P = .026; homogenous: adjusted OR = 3.74, 95% CI = 1.12-12.45, P = .032; and recessive: adjusted OR = 4.06, 95% CI = 1.22-13.48, P = .022). Stratified analysis further demonstrated that the MALAT1 rs664589 C>G polymorphism significantly increased the risk of endometrial cancer susceptibility in patients with no history of surgery, more deliveries, BMI between 25 and 29.9, and FIGO stages II-III. Compared with the wild-type GCG haplotype carriers, individuals with CGG haplotypes had a higher risk of developing endometrial cancer. Conclusion The MALAT1 rs664589 C>G polymorphism was associated with a significant increase in endometrial cancer risk.

TI Estrous cycle impacts microRNA content in extracellular vesicles that
   modulate bovine cumulus cell transcripts during in vitro maturation
SO BIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION
AB Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanoparticles secreted by ovarian follicle cells. Extracellular vesicles are an important form of intercellular communication, since they carry bioactive contents, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), mRNAs, and proteins. MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNA capable of modulating mRNA translation. Thus, EVs can play a role in follicle and oocyte development. However, it is not clear if EV contents vary with the estrous cycle stage. The aim of this study was to investigate the bovine miRNA content in EVs obtained from follicles at different estrous cycle stages, which are associated with different progesterone (P4) levels in the follicular fluid (FF). We collected FF from 3 to 6 mm follicles and evaluated the miRNA profile of the EVs and their effects on cumulus-oocyte complexes during in vitro maturation. We observed that EVs from low P4 group have a higher abundance of miRNAs predicted to modulate pathways, such as MAPK, RNA transport, Hippo, Cell cycle, FoxO, oocyte meiosis, and TGF-beta. Additionally, EVs were taken up by cumulus cells and, thus, affected the RNA global profile 9 h after EV supplementation. Cumulus cells supplemented with EVs from low P4 presented upregulated genes that could modulate biological processes, such as oocyte development, immune responses, and Notch signaling compared with genes of cumulus cells in the EV free media or with EVs from high P4 follicles. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that EV miRNA contents are distinct in follicles exposed to different estrous cycle stage. Supplementation with EVs impacts gene expression and biological processes in cumulus cells.
   Summary Sentence
   MicroRNA contents of small EVs obtained from bovine follicular fluid are modified depending on the estrous cycle stage and can modulate the RNA profile of cumulus cells during in vitro oocyte maturation.

TI Plasmodium falciparum Calcium-Dependent Protein Kinase 4 is Critical for
   Male Gametogenesis and Transmission to the Mosquito Vector
SO MBIO
AB Gametocytes of the malaria parasite Plasmodium are taken up by the mosquito vector with an infectious blood meal, representing a critical stage for parasite transmission. Calcium-independent protein kinases (CDPKs) play key roles in calcium-mediated signaling across the complex life cycle of the parasite. We sought to understand their role in human parasite transmission from the host to the mosquito vector and thus investigated the role of the human-infective parasite Plasmodium falciparum CDPK4 in the parasite life cycle. P. falciparum cdpk4(-) parasites created by targeted gene deletion showed no effect in blood stage development or gametocyte development. However, cdpk4(-) parasites showed a severe defect in male gametogenesis and the emergence of flagellated male gametes. To understand the molecular underpinnings of this defect, we performed mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic analyses of wild-type and Plasmodium falciparum cdpk4(-) late gametocyte stages to identify key CDPK4-mediated phosphorylation events that may be important for the regulation of male gametogenesis. We further employed in vitro assays to identify these putative substrates of Plasmodium falciparum CDPK4. This indicated that CDPK4 regulates male gametogenesis by directly or indirectly controlling key essential events, such as DNA replication, mRNA translation, and cell motility. Taken together, our work demonstrates that PfCDPK4 is a central kinase that regulates exflagellation and thereby is critical for parasite transmission to the mosquito vector.
   IMPORTANCE Transmission of the malaria parasite to the mosquito vector is critical for the completion of the sexual stage of the parasite life cycle and is dependent on the release of male gametes from the gametocyte body inside the mosquito midgut. In the present study, we demonstrate that PfCDPK4 is critical for male gametogenesis and is involved in phosphorylation of proteins essential for male gamete emergence. Targeting PfCDPK4 and its substrates may provide insights into achieving effective malaria transmission-blocking strategies.

TI Intergenic ORFs as elementary structural modules of de novo gene birth
   and protein evolution
SO GENOME RESEARCH
AB The noncoding genome plays an important role in de novo gene birth and in the emergence of genetic novelty. Nevertheless, how noncoding sequences' properties could promote the birth of novel genes and shape the evolution and the structural diversity of proteins remains unclear. Therefore, by combining different bioinformatic approaches, we characterized the fold potential diversity of the amino acid sequences encoded by all intergenic open reading frames (ORFs) of S. cerevisiae with the aim of (1) exploring whether the structural states' diversity of proteomes is already present in noncoding sequences, and (2) estimating the potential of the noncoding genome to produce novel protein bricks that could either give rise to novel genes or be integrated into pre-existing proteins, thus participating in protein structure diversity and evolution. We showed that amino acid sequences encoded by most yeast intergenic ORFs contain the elementary building blocks of protein structures. Moreover, they encompass the large structural state diversity of canonical proteins, with the majority predicted as foldable. Then, we investigated the early stages of de novo gene birth by reconstructing the ancestral sequences of 70 yeast de novo genes and characterized the sequence and structural properties of intergenic ORFs with a strong translation signal. This enabled us to highlight sequence and structural factors determining de novo gene emergence. Finally, we showed a strong correlation between the fold potential of de novo proteins and one of their ancestral amino acid sequences, reflecting the relationship between the noncoding genome and the protein structure universe.

TI Integrative analysis of the Trypanosoma brucei gene expression cascade
   predicts differential regulation of mRNA processing and unusual control
   of ribosomal protein expression
SO BMC GENOMICS
AB Background: Trypanosoma brucei is a unicellular parasite which multiplies in mammals (bloodstream form) and Tsetse flies (procyclic form). Trypanosome RNA polymerase II transcription is polycistronic, individual mRNAs being excised by trans splicing and polyadenylation. We previously made detailed measurements of mRNA half-lives in bloodstream and procyclic forms, and developed a mathematical model of gene expression for bloodstream forms. At the whole transcriptome level, many bloodstream-form mRNAs were less abundant than was predicted by the model.
   Results: We refined the published mathematical model and extended it to the procyclic form. We used the model, together with known mRNA half-lives, to predict the abundances of individual mRNAs, assuming rapid, unregulated mRNA processing; then we compared the results with measured mRNA abundances. Remarkably, the abundances of most mRNAs in procyclic forms are predicted quite well by the model, being largely explained by variations in mRNA decay rates and length. In bloodstream forms substantially more mRNAs are less abundant than predicted. We list mRNAs that are likely to show particularly slow or inefficient processing, either in both forms or with developmental regulation. We also measured ribosome occupancies of all mRNAs in trypanosomes grown in the same conditions as were used to measure mRNA turnover. In procyclic forms there was a weak positive correlation between ribosome density and mRNA half- life, suggesting cross-talk between translation and mRNA decay; ribosome density was related to the proportion of the mRNA on polysomes, indicating control of translation initiation. Ribosomal protein mRNAs in procyclics appeared to be exceptionally rapidly processed but poorly translated.
   Conclusions: Levels of mRNAs in procyclic form trypanosomes are determined mainly by length and mRNA decay, with some control of precursor processing. In bloodstream forms variations in nuclear events play a larger role in transcriptome regulation, suggesting aquisition of new control mechanisms during adaptation to mammalian parasitism.

TI Long Non-Coding RNA and microRNA Interplay in Colorectal Cancer and
   Their Effect on the Tumor Microenvironment
SO CANCERS
AB Simple Summary The interplay between the tumour and the immune system plays a vital role in disease progression. There are several mechanisms the tumour imposes to repress the immune response. Dysregulation of non-coding RNAs, the main role of which is to regulate transcription and translation, leads to expressional changes in various signaling molecules and can subsequently affect infiltration and/or activation of immune cells. Here, we focus on the miRNA/lncRNA/protein regulatory axes, which are known to influence the immune response in colorectal cancer. As the current staging and grading systems are not sufficient to stratify patients for therapy and predict the outcome of the disease, there is an urgent need to understand cancer in its complexity. The mutual relationship between tumour and immune or stromal cells leads to rapid evolution and subsequent genetic and epigenetic changes. Immunoscore has been introduced as a diagnostic tool for colorectal cancer (CRC) only recently, emphasising the role of the specific tumor microenvironment in patient's prognosis and overall outcome. Despite the fact that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), cannot be translated into proteins, they significantly affect cell's transcriptome and translatome. miRNA binding to mRNA efficiently blocks its translation and leads to mRNA destruction. On the other hand, miRNAs can be bound by lncRNAs or circular RNAs (circRNAs), which prevents them from interfering with translation. In this way, ncRNAs create a multi-step network that regulates the cell's translatome. ncRNAs are also shed by the cell as exogenous RNAs and they are also found in exosomes, suggesting their role in intercellular communication. Hence, these mechanisms affect the tumor microenvironment as much as protein signal molecules. In this review, we provide an insight into the current knowledge of the microenvironment, lncRNAs', and miRNAs' interplay. Understanding mechanisms that underlie the evolution of a tissue as complex as a tumour is crucial for the future success in therapy.

TI Bicuculline regulated protein synthesis is dependent on Homer1 and
   promotes its interaction with eEF2K through mTORC1-dependent
   phosphorylation
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY
AB The regulation of protein synthesis is a vital and finely tuned process in cellular physiology. In neurons, this process is very precisely regulated, as which mRNAs undergo translation is highly dependent on context. One of the most prominent regulators of protein synthesis is the enzyme eukaryotic elongation factor kinase 2 (eEF2K) that regulates the elongation stage of protein synthesis. This kinase and its substrate, eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) are important in processes such as neuronal development and synaptic plasticity. eEF2K is regulated by multiple mechanisms including Ca2+-ions and the mTORC1 signaling pathway, both of which play key roles in neurological processes such as learning and memory. In such settings, the localized control of protein synthesis is of crucial importance. In this work, we sought to investigate how the localization of eEF2K is controlled and the impact of this on protein synthesis in neuronal cells. In this study, we used both SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and mouse cortical neurons, and pharmacologically and/or genetic approaches to modify eEF2K function. We show that eEF2K activity and localization can be regulated by its binding partner Homer1b/c, a scaffolding protein known for its participation in calcium-regulated signaling pathways. Furthermore, our results indicate that this interaction is regulated by the mTORC1 pathway, through a known phosphorylation site in eEF2K (S396), and that it affects rates of localized protein synthesis at synapses depending on the presence or absence of this scaffolding protein.

TI Oral impact on daily performance (OIDP) scale for use in Sri Lankan
   adolescents: a cross sectional modification and validation study
SO BMC ORAL HEALTH
AB Background Oral Health Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL) measures play an important role in understanding subjective patient experiences in oral health care. The Oral Impact on Daily Performance (OIDP) scale is a validated OHRQoL tool that measures the impact and extent to which an individual's daily activities may be compromised by their oral health. It is commonly used to facilitate oral health service planning. The aim of this study was to modify and validate a Sinhalese version of the OIDP for use in Sri Lankan adolescents. Methods Stage I involved cultural adaptation of the tool through translation and modification. Stage II involved the exploring factor structure, validation and a reliability assessment. After translation and cultural adaptation, stage II was conducted among 220 secondary school students aged 15-19 in the Gampaha district, Sri Lanka. Participants completed the modified OIDP scale along with questions on self-reported perceived oral health problems and treatment need which were used to assesses the concurrent validity of the modified OIDP scale. Factorability was assessed by inspection of correlation matrix and Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin and Bartlett's Test of Sphericity tests as a measure of sampling adequacy. An exploratory factor analysis was carried out using Principal Component Analysis method and factors were rotated using the oblimin method. Results The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure was 0.87 and Bartlett's test of Sphericity was significant (p < 0.001) Cronbach's alpha was calculated as 0.88, indicating a high level of internal consistency of the modified OIDP scale. The principal component analysis produced two factors with Eigen values ranging from 1.12 to 4.40, explaining 70.0% of total variance. Concurrent validity was satisfactory as the OIDP score increased when the adolescents' perceived oral health decreased. The final modified OIDP consists of eight self-reported items which assesses the impact severity of eight daily performances over past three months. Participant scores ranged from 0 to 24 out of a worst possible score of 40, and nearly 48% of the responders reported at least one impact during past three months. The most prevalent oral health impact related to chewing and enjoying foods, reported by 36.8% of respondents. Conclusion This study suggests that the modified OIDP scale has promising psychometric properties and is appropriate for use among adolescents in Sri Lanka. Further research is required to test the validity of this tool in other cohorts.

TI Frameworks for embedding a research culture in allied health practice: a
   rapid review
SO HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS
AB Background: Although allied health clinicians play a key role in the provision of healthcare, embedding a culture of research within public and private health systems remains a challenge. In this rapid review we critically evaluate frameworks for embedding research into routine allied health practice, as the basis for high quality, safe, efficient and consumer-focused care.
   Methods: A rapid review (PROSPERO: CRD42017075699) was conducted to evaluate frameworks designed to create and embed research in the health sector. Included were full-text, English-language, peer-reviewed publications or Government reports of frameworks that could inform the implementation of an allied health research framework. Eight electronic databases and four government websites were searched, using search terms such as models, frameworks and research capacity-building. Two independent researchers conducted all review stages and used content and thematic analysis to interpret the results.
   Results: Sixteen framework papers were finally included. Content analysis identified 44 system and regulatory level items that informed the research frameworks, 125 healthcare organisation items and 76 items relating to individual clinicians. Thematic analysis identified four major themes. Firstly, sustainable change requires allied health research policies, regulation, governance and organisational structures that support and value evidence-based practice. Secondly, research capability, receptivity, advocacy and literacy of healthcare leaders and managers are key to successful research implementation. Third, organisational factors that facilitate a research culture include dedicated staff research positions, time allocated to research, mentoring, professional education and research infrastructure. When healthcare agencies had strong partnerships with universities and co-located research leaders, research implementation was strengthened. Finally, individual attributes of clinicians, such as their research skills and capabilities, motivation, and participation in research teams, are essential to embedding research into practice.
   Conclusion: Theoretical frameworks were identified that informed processes to embed a culture of allied health research into healthcare services. Research-led and evidence-informed allied health practice enables optimisation of workforce capability and high-quality care.

TI Shakespeare the Escape Artist: Sourcing the East in Pericles, Prince of
   Tyre
SO STUDIES IN PHILOLOGY
AB This essay argues that William Shakespeare's Pericles, Prince of Tyre constitutes a genealogical journey outside the periphery of the West. While scholars tend to undervalue the play's geographic specificity, interpreting Pericles in the context of Western Christian culture, I discuss the play's commitment to representing an authentic Eastern geography and what that commitment very well implies. In mapping a recognizably Eastern Mediterranean space, Pericles lays the groundwork for recreating a suprarational experience of the sacred consistent with a set of beliefs that developed beyond the borders of Rome. Indeed, linguistic excavation indicates that the source for Pericles, the tale of Apollonius, has Greek roots that position it partly as an Eastern Christian text. This is because the story not only originated in Asia Minor, but it likely passed into Latin through a Byzantine epitome, blending Eastern Christian attributes into its pagan narrative. With Pericles, Shakespeare nurtures some of these attributes, staging them for the first time since the story's inception. Although Shakespeare and his contemporaries had limited contact with the Greek Christian world, they would have been exposed to its culture and theology in humanist translations of Greek patristic writings, in travel narratives, even in Protestant polemical texts (such as John Foxe's Acts and Monuments). These channels of exposure, together with the Eastern rootedness of the source itself, coalesce in Pericles, Shakespeare's first experiment with tragicomic romance.

TI Natural killer and natural killer T cells in liver fibrosis
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-MOLECULAR BASIS OF DISEASE
AB The liver lymphocyte population is enriched with natural killer (NK) cells, which plays key role in host defense against viral infection and tumor transformation. Recent evidence from animal models suggests that NK cells also play an important role in inhibiting liver fibrosis by selectively killing early or senescence activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and by producing the-anti-fibrotic cytokine IFN-gamma. Furthermore, clinical studies have revealed that human NK cells can kill primary human HSCs and that the ability of NK cells from HCV patients to kill HSCs is enhanced and correlates inversely with the stages of liver fibrosis. IFN-alpha treatment enhances, while other factors (e.g., alcohol, TGF-beta) attenuate, the cytotoxicity of NK cells against HSCs, thereby differentially regulating liver fibrogenesis. In addition, the mouse liver lymphocyte population is also enriched for natural killer T (NKT) cells, whereas human liver lymphocytes have a much lower percentage of NKT cells. Many studies suggest that NKT cells promote liver fibrogenesis by producing pro-fibrotic cytokines such as IL-4, IL-13, hedgehog ligands, and osteopontin; however, NKT cells may also attenuate liver fibrosis under certain conditions by killing HSCs and by producing IFN-gamma. Finally, the potential for NK and NKT cells to be used as therapeutic targets for anti-fibrotic therapy is discussed.

TI Human embryonic poly(A)-binding protein (EPAB) alternative splicing is
   differentially regulated in human oocytes and embryos
SO MOLECULAR HUMAN REPRODUCTION
AB Oocyte maturation is associated with suppression of transcriptional activity. Consequently, gene expression during oocyte maturation, fertilization and early embryo development, until zygotic genome activation (ZGA) is primarily regulated by translational activation of maternally derived mRNAs. Embryonic poly(A)-binding protein (EPAB) is the predominant poly(A)-binding protein in Xenopus, mouse and human oocytes and early embryos prior to ZGA. EPAB plays a key role in polyadenylation-dependent translational activation of mRNAs by stabilizing polyadenylated mRNAs and by stimulating their translation. Epab-knockout female mice are sterile, fail to generate mature oocytes and display impaired cumulus expansion and ovulation. Consistent with its role during gametogenesis and early embryo development, Xenopus and mouse Epab mRNA is expressed exclusively in oocytes and early embryos, and is undetectable following ZGA or in somatic tissues. Herein, we demonstrate that although EPAB is expressed in human somatic tissues, its transcripts largely consist of an alternatively spliced form lacking the first 58 bp of exon 8, which leads to the formation of a premature stop codon 6 amino acids downstream on exon 8, and omission of the functionally critical poly(A)-binding domain. Moreover, 8-cell and blastocyst stage human embryos also express only the alternatively spliced form of EPAB. On the other hand, the full-length form of EPAB mRNA is exclusively expressed in oocytes. In conclusion, in contrast with the transcriptional regulation in Xenopus and mouse, oocyte- and early embryo-specific expression of EPAB in human is regulated by a post-transcriptional mechanism.

TI Transcriptome analysis of the muscle of fast- and slow-growing phoenix
   barb (Spinibarbus denticulatus denticulatus)
SO JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY
AB Growth rate is a commercial trait in aquaculture that is influenced by multiple factors, among which genetic composition plays a fundamental role in the growth rate of species. The phoenix barb (Spinibarbus denticulatus denticulatus) is a widely distributed freshwater fish species in South China. Although S. d. denticulatus is reared in South China, the molecular mechanisms underlying the growth rate of the species remain unclear. Here, the authors performed transcriptome analysis of muscle tissues from fast-growing (FG) and slow-growing (SG) S. d. denticulatus at 90, 150, and 300 days after hatch (DAH) to elucidate its growth mechanism. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two groups were enriched in pathways related to muscle growth, glycolysis, and energy and lipid metabolism. Nonetheless, a higher number of DEGs were identified in the FG vs. SG groups at 90 and 300 DAH compared with 150 DAH. DEGs identified at 90 DAH were mainly enriched in the GH/IGF axis, PI3K-Akt signalling pathway, AMPK signalling pathway and lipid metabolism highly expressed in FG individuals. DEGs identified at 300 DAH were mainly enriched in PI3K-Akt signalling pathway, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, gene translation and lipid metabolism. In addition, some genes were expressed during the early growth stage in FG individuals but expressed during the late stage in SG individuals, indicating considerable variations in the expression profiles of growth-related genes at different developmental stages. Overall, these findings contribute to the understanding of the growth mechanism of S. d. denticulatus, which would be useful for the propagation of fast-growing breeds.

TI The Merkel Cell Polyomavirus Minor Capsid Protein
SO PLOS PATHOGENS
AB The surface of polyomavirus virions is composed of pentameric knobs of the major capsid protein, VP1. In previously studied polyomavirus species, such as SV40, two interior capsid proteins, VP2 and VP3, emerge from the virion to play important roles during the infectious entry process. Translation of the VP3 protein initiates at a highly conserved Met-Ala-Leu motif within the VP2 open reading frame. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that Merkel cell polyomavirus ( MCV or MCPyV) is a member of a divergent clade of polyomaviruses that lack the conserved VP3 N-terminal motif. Consistent with this observation, we show that VP3 is not detectable in MCV-infected cells, VP3 is not found in native MCV virions, and mutation of possible alternative VP3-initiating methionine codons did not significantly affect MCV infectivity in culture. In contrast, VP2 knockout resulted in a > 100-fold decrease in native MCV infectivity, despite normal virion assembly, viral DNA packaging, and cell attachment. Although pseudovirus-based experiments confirmed that VP2 plays an essential role for infection of some cell lines, other cell lines were readily transduced by pseudovirions lacking VP2. In cell lines where VP2 was needed for efficient infectious entry, the presence of a conserved myristoyl modification on the N-terminus of VP2 was important for its function. The results show that a single minor capsid protein, VP2, facilitates a post-attachment stage of MCV infectious entry into some, but not all, cell types.

TI Cells, Materials, and Fabrication Processes for Cardiac Tissue
   Engineering
SO FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Cardiovascular disease is the number one killer worldwide, with myocardial infarction (MI) responsible for approximately 1 in 6 deaths. The lack of endogenous regenerative capacity, added to the deleterious remodelling programme set into motion by myocardial necrosis, turns MI into a progressively debilitating disease, which current pharmacological therapy cannot halt. The advent of Regenerative Therapies over 2 decades ago kick-started a whole new scientific field whose aim was to prevent or even reverse the pathological processes of MI. As a highly dynamic organ, the heart displays a tight association between 3D structure and function, with the non-cellular components, mainly the cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM), playing both fundamental active and passive roles. Tissue engineering aims to reproduce this tissue architecture and function in order to fabricate replicas able to mimic or even substitute damaged organs. Recent advances in cell reprogramming and refinement of methods for additive manufacturing have played a critical role in the development of clinically relevant engineered cardiovascular tissues. This review focuses on the generation of human cardiac tissues for therapy, paying special attention to human pluripotent stem cells and their derivatives. We provide a perspective on progress in regenerative medicine from the early stages of cell therapy to the present day, as well as an overview of cellular processes, materials and fabrication strategies currently under investigation. Finally, we summarise current clinical applications and reflect on the most urgent needs and gaps to be filled for efficient translation to the clinical arena.

TI Mammalian Orthoreovirus Factories Modulate Stress Granule Protein
   Localization by Interaction with G3BP1
SO JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
AB Mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV) infection induces phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2 alpha, which promotes the formation of discrete cytoplasmic inclusions, termed stress granules (SGs). SGs are emerging as a component of the innate immune response to virus infection, and modulation of SG assembly is a common mechanism employed by viruses to counter this antiviral response. We previously showed that MRV infection induces SGs early and then interferes with SG formation as infection proceeds. In this work, we found that SG-associated proteins localized to the periphery of virus-encoded cytoplasmic structures, termed virus factories (VFs), where viral transcription, translation, and replication occur. The localization of SG proteins to VFs was dependent on polysome dissociation and occurred via association of the SG effector protein, Ras-GAP SH3-binding protein 1 (G3BP1), with the MRV nonstructural protein sigma NS, which localizes to VFs via association with VF nucleating protein, mu NS. Deletion analysis of the sigma NS RNA binding domain and G3BP1 RNA (RRM) and ribosomal (RGG) binding domains showed that sigma NS association and VF localization phenotypes of G3BP1 do not occur solely through RNA or ribosomal binding but require both the RRM and RGG domains of G3BP1 for maximal viral-factory-like structure (VFL) localization and sigma NS association. Coexpression of sigma NS and mu NS resulted in disruption of normal SG puncta, and in cells lacking G3BP1, MRV replication was enhanced in a manner correlating with strain-dependent induction of host translation shutoff. These results suggest that sigma NS association with G3BP1 and relocalization of G3BP1 to the VF periphery play roles in SG disruption to facilitate MRV replication in the host translational shutoff environment.
   IMPORTANCE SGs and SG effector proteins have emerged as important, yet poorly understood, players in the host's innate immune response to virus infection. MRV infection induces SGs early during infection that are dispersed and/or prevented from forming during late stages of infection despite continued activation of the eIF2 alpha signaling pathway. Cellular and viral components involved in disruption of SGs during late stages of MRV infection remain to be elucidated. This work provides evidence that MRV disruption of SGs may be facilitated by association of the MRV nonstructural protein sigma NS with the major SG effector protein G3BP1 and subsequent localization of G3BP1 and other SG-associated proteins around the peripheries of virus-encoded factories, interrupting the normal formation of SGs. Our findings also reveal the importance of G3BP1 as an inhibitor of MRV replication during infection for the first time.

TI Transcriptome Analysis Reveals Potential Mechanism in Storage Protein
   Trafficking within Developing Grains of Common Wheat
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB Gluten proteins are the major storage protein fraction in the mature wheat grain. They are restricted to the starchy endosperm, which defines the viscoelastic properties of wheat dough. The synthesis of these storage proteins is controlled by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is directed into the vacuole via the Golgi apparatus. In the present study, transcriptome analysis was used to explore the potential mechanism within critical stages of grain development of wheat cultivar "Shaannong 33" and its sister line used as the control (CK). Samples were collected at 10 DPA (days after anthesis), 14 DPA, 20 DPA, and 30 DPA for transcriptomic analysis. The comparative transcriptome analysis identified that a total of 18,875 genes were differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between grains of four groups "T10 vs. CK10, T14 vs. CK14, T20 vs. CK20, and T30 vs. CK30", including 2824 up-regulated and 5423 down-regulated genes in T30 vs. CK30. Further, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment highlighted the maximum number of genes regulating protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) during grain enlargement stages (10-20 DPA). In addition, KEGG database analysis reported 1362 and 788 DEGs involved in translation, ribosomal structure, biogenesis, flavonoid biosynthesis pathway and intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport through protein processing within ER pathway (ko04141). Notably, consistent with the higher expression of intercellular storage protein trafficking genes at the initial 10 DPA, there was relatively low expression at later stages. Expression levels of nine randomly selected genes were verified by qRT-PCR, which were consistent with the transcriptome data. These data suggested that the initial stages of "cell division" played a significant role in protein quality control within the ER, thus maintaining the protein quality characteristics at grain maturity. Furthermore, our data suggested that the protein synthesis, folding, and trafficking pathways directed by a different number of genes during the grain enlargement stage contributed to the observed high-quality characteristics of gluten protein in Shaannong 33 (Triticum aestivum L.).

TI Quantitative proteomic analysis reveals differentially expressed
   proteins in Leishmania major metacyclogenesis
SO MICROBIAL PATHOGENESIS
AB Leishmaniasis is an infectious disease caused by Leishmania that widespread in 98 countries. The differentiation of Leishmania (L) from procyclic to metacyclic promastigote has occurred along with morphological and biochemical changes in proteome scale. We aim here to identify the proteomes of two successive developmental forms (procyclic and metacyclic promastigotes) from Leishmania major isolates using SWATH-MS quantitative proteomics technique. Isolated proteins from procyclic and metacyclic lysate were digested, fractionated and subjected to SWATH-MS. Proteins significantly different in abundance were analyzed using gene ontology (GO) and protein-protein interaction network (PPIN). Our study showed that 52 proteins were changed in abundance between the two consecutive developmental stages. Differentially expressed proteins were classified into nine classes by GO analysis. Significant modulations in translation, antioxidant and stress-related defenses, energy metabolism, structural and motility-related proteins were detected between procyclic and metacyclic stages. We found that elongation factor-2 and various structural constituents of ribosome were down-regulated during metacyclogenesis, while motility related proteins including ADP-ribosylation factor-3, paraflegellar rod protein-2C and tubulin alpha-chain were up regulated. According to network analysis, ENOL has been introduced as main hub-bottleneck protein and EF-1b, Hsp60 and GDH have been determined as seed proteins. Our results show that significant proteins in abundance are crucial features of metacyclogenesis in L. major. The protein function analysis illustrated that synthetic pathway involved proteins were down-regulated in metacyclic, which is the main feature of this stage of parasite growth cycle, while up-regulation of motility and energy metabolism related proteins is consistent with infective feature of metacyclic stage. Based on our results, we suppose that differentially expressed proteins possibly play a critical role in L. major differentiation. In addition, our finding demonstrated the possibility of SWATH-MS as viable technique to faster detect new stage-specific proteins in Leishmania and further studies are required for the validation of the results.

TI Heat Shock Protein 60 Is Involved in Viral Replication Complex Formation
   and Facilitates Foot and Mouth Virus Replication by Stabilizing Viral
   Nonstructural Proteins 3A and 2C
SO MBIO
AB FMDV is the leading cause of the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), affecting cloven-hoofed animals with high morbidity and mortality. We determined that HSP60 is required for efficient viral RNA replication and mRNA translation during FMDV infection.
   The maintenance of viral protein homeostasis depends on the machinery of the infected host cells, giving us an insight into the interplay between host and virus. Accumulating evidence suggests that heat shock protein 60 (HSP60), as one molecular chaperone, is involved in regulating virus infection. However, the role of HSP60 during foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) replication and its specific mechanisms have not been reported. We demonstrate that HSP60 modulates the FMDV life cycle. HSP60 plays a role at the postentry stage of the viral life cycle, including RNA replication and mRNA translation; however, HSP60 does not affect viral replication of Seneca Valley virus (SVA) or encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). We found that HSP60 is involved in FMDV replication complex (RC) formation. Furthermore, our results indicate that HSP60 interacts with FMDV nonstructural proteins 3A and 2C, key elements of the viral replication complex. We also show that HSP60 regulates the stability of 3A and 2C via caspase-dependent and autophagy-lysosome-dependent degradation, thereby promoting FMDV RNA synthesis and mRNA translation mediated by the RC. Additionally, we determined that the apical domain of HSP60 is responsible for interacting with 3A and 2C. The N terminus of 3A and ATPase domain of 2C are involved in binding to HSP60. Importantly, HSP60 depletion potently reduced FMDV pathogenicity in infected mice. Altogether, this study demonstrates a specific role of HSP60 in promoting FMDV replication. Furthermore, targeting host HSP60 will help us design the FMDV-specific antiviral drugs. IMPORTANCE FMDV is the leading cause of the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), affecting cloven-hoofed animals with high morbidity and mortality. We determined that HSP60 is required for efficient viral RNA replication and mRNA translation during FMDV infection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HSP60 interacts with FMDV nonstructural proteins 3A and 2C, the elements of the RC; HSP60 contributes to the stability of 3A and 2C to affect the formation and function of the RC. We also validated the potential role of HSP60 as the antiviral target in vivo using small interfering RNA. These findings deepen the understanding of the host-virus interaction and provide information supporting the design of novel therapeutics for FMDV infection.

TI Proteomics analysis reveals that the proto-oncogene eIF-5A indirectly
   influences the growth, invasion and replication of Toxoplasma gondii
   tachyzoite
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB Background: The proliferative stage (tachyzoite) of Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is critical for its transmission and pathogenesis, and a proto-oncogene eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF-5A) plays an important role in various cellular processes such as cell multiplication.
   Methods: We performed a proteomic study to evaluate the specific roles of eIF-5A involved in invasion and replication of T. gondii, and both in vivo and in vitro trials using eIF-5A-interfered and wild tachyzoites were performed to verify the proteomic results.
   Results: The results of our study showed that T. gondii eIF-5A affected tachyzoite growth and also participated in the synthesis of proteins through regulation of both ribosomal and splicing pathways. Inhibition of eIF-5A in T. gondii resulted in the downregulated expression of soluble adhesions, such as microneme protein 1 (MIC1) and MIC4, which in turn decreased the parasite population that adhered to the surface of host cells. The reduced attachment, combined with lower expression of some rhoptry proteins (ROPs) and dense granule antigens (GRAs) involved in different stages of T. gondii invasion such as ROP4 and GRA3, ultimately reduce the invasion efficiency. These processes regulated by eIF-5A eventually affect the replication of tachyzoites.
   Conclusions: Our findings showed that eIF-5A influenced tachyzoite survival and was also involved in the process of parasite invasion and replication. These results will provide new clues for further development of targeted drugs to control T. gondii infection.

TI Application of Support Vector Machine on fMRI Data as Biomarkers in
   Schizophrenia Diagnosis: A Systematic Review
SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
AB Non-invasive measurements of brain function and structure as neuroimaging in patients with mental illnesses are useful and powerful tools for studying discriminatory biomarkers. To date, functional MRI (fMRI), structural MRI (sMRI) represent the most used techniques to provide multiple perspectives on brain function, structure, and their connectivity. Recently, there has been rising attention in using machine-learning (ML) techniques, pattern recognition methods, applied to neuroimaging data to characterize disease-related alterations in brain structure and function and to identify phenotypes, for example, for translation into clinical and early diagnosis. Our aim was to provide a systematic review according to the PRISMA statement of Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques in making diagnostic discrimination between SCZ patients from healthy controls using neuroimaging data from functional MRI as input. We included studies using SVM as ML techniques with patients diagnosed with Schizophrenia. From an initial sample of 660 papers, at the end of the screening process, 22 articles were selected, and included in our review. This technique can be a valid, inexpensive, and non-invasive support to recognize and detect patients at an early stage, compared to any currently available assessment or clinical diagnostic methods in order to save crucial time. The higher accuracy of SVM models and the new integrated methods of ML techniques could play a decisive role to detect patients with SCZ or other major psychiatric disorders in the early stages of the disease or to potentially determine their neuroimaging risk factors in the near future.

TI Superhero Shakespeare in Golden Age Comics
SO MULTICULTURAL SHAKESPEARE-TRANSLATION APPROPRIATION AND PERFORMANCE
AB Albert Lewis Kanter launched Classic Comics in 1941, a series of comic books that retold classic literature for a young audience. Five of Shakespeare's celebrated plays appear in the collection. The popularity of Classics Illustrated encouraged Seaboard Publishing to issue a competitive brand, Stories by Famous Authors Illustrated (1949-51), which retold three Shakespearean dramas Although both these enterprises aimed to reinforce a humanist perspective of education based on Western literature, the classic comics belie a Posthuman aesthetic by presenting Shakespearean characters in scenes and postures that recall Golden Age superheroes. By examining the Shakespearean covers of Classic Illustrated and Stories by Famous Authors, this essay explores how Shakespearean characters are reimagined as Superhuman in strength and power.

TI Profiles analysis reveals circular RNAs involving zebrafish
   physiological development
SO JOURNAL OF CELLULAR PHYSIOLOGY
AB Recent studies have found that known functions of circular RNAs (circRNAs) include sequestration of microRNAs (miRNAs) or proteins, modulation of transcription and interference with splicing, and even translation to produce polypeptides. The zebrafish model is also demonstrably similar to humans in many studies. To explore the changes in circRNAs during embryonic development and to further research the mechanism of action of circRNAs in development-related diseases, Zebrafish embryos at the blastula period, gastrula period, segmentation period, throat stage, and incubation period were collected. Illumina deep-sequencing technology and CircRNA Identifier (CIRI) algorithm were used to detect circRNAs. In total, we identified 1,028 circRNAs (junction reads 5 and p<0.05). Considering that the function of circRNAs is related to host genes, a bioinformatics analysis revealed these differentially expressed host genes are involved in NOTCH signaling pathways, cardiovascular system development, retinal ganglion cell axon guidance, and so on. Moreover, circRNAs can participate in biological regulation through the function of miRNA sponges. TargetScan and miRanda were used to predict 73 miRNAs binding to circRNAs such as miR-19b, miR-124, and so on. Some miRNAs play important roles in embryogenesis. The peak expression of circRNAs is distributed at different time points, suggesting that it may be involved in embryogenesis at different stages. Our study provides a foundation for understanding the dynamic regulation of circRNA transcriptomes during embryogenesis and identifies novel key circRNAs that might control embryonic development in a zebrafish model.

SO ZEITSCHRIFT FUR INTERKULTURELLE GERMANISTIK
AB Ulrich Alexander Boschwitz' recently discovered original German version of the novel The Fugitive (first published in the English translation in 1939 and 1940) is probably the earliest literary account of the November-pogroms of 1938. Within a single night the sense of time has changed radically. Boschwitz' focus is the sudden decision to escape. The Jewish protagonist leaves his entire previous life behind - his wife, his business, his self-image as a German citizen - after suddenly finding himself a foreigner in his own country. He travels erratically on trains and tries to cross the border. He fails, gets captured, then goes mad. - Time is also running out in Erich Maria Remarque's The Night in Lisbon (1962), which is set in 1942. A married couple give up shortly before boarding a ship to the United States, the wife - suffering from the last stages of cancer - commits suicide. The Jewish husband recounts their dramatic flight in a lengthy report. Then he passes on their two passports, visas and tickets for the ship to another Jewish refugee who is thus able to escape together with his wife the next day. Both novels organize the running out of time with techniques borrowed from drama (e.g. peri-peteia, phases of retardation, and the frequent use of the "deus ex machina").

TI From participation to diagnostic assessment: a systematic scoping review
   of the role of the primary healthcare sector in the National Bowel
   Cancer Screening Program
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PRIMARY HEALTH
AB Primary health care (PHC) plays a vital support role in organised colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programs by encouraging patient participation and ensuring timely referral for diagnostic assessment follow up. A systematic scoping review of the current evidence was conducted to inform strategies that better engage the PHC sector in organised CRC screening programs. Articles published from 2005 to November 2019 were searched across five databases. Evidence was synthesised and interventions that specifically require PHC involvement were mapped to stages of the CRC screening pathway. Fifty-seven unique studies were identified in which patient, provider and system-level interventions align with defined stages of the CRC screening pathway: namely, identifying/reminding patients who have not responded to CRC screening (non-adherence) (n = 46) and follow up of a positive screen referral (n = 11). Self-management support initiatives (patient level) and improvement initiatives (system level) demonstrate consistent benefits along the CRC screening pathway. Interventions evaluated as part of a quality-improvement process tended to report effectiveness; however, the variation in reporting makes it difficult to determine which elements contributed to the overall study outcomes. To maximise the benefits of population-based screening programs, better integration into existing primary care services can be achieved through targeting preventive and quality care interventions along the entire screening pathway.

TI Expression of Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 3f Is Associated with
   Prognosis in Gastric Carcinomas
SO ONCOLOGY RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
AB Background: Eukaryotic initiation factor 3f (eIF3f) expression, which plays an important role in human cancer, is significantly decreased in various types of cancers. The aim of this study was to detect the expression of eIF3f in gastric carcinoma (GC), which until now has not been reported. Methods: Expression of eIF3f was detected by imnnunohistochemistry in GC tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANCT) from 195 patients with stage I-III GC who underwent curative gastrectomy. Clinicopathological results, including survival, were analyzed. Results: Expression rate of eIF3f in GC and ANCT were 44.8 and 81.7% respectively. Low expression of eIF3f was significantly associated with an increased serum level of carcinoma embryonic antigen (p = 0.02), but not with levels of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (p = 0.29). eIF3f levels were linked to more advanced tumor stages and likelihood of recurrence (all p < 0.05).The Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated that decreased expression of eIF3f was a significant factor for a poor prognosis for GC patients (p = 0.04). Conclusion: eIF3f may play an important role in recurrence. Its function and potential as a prognostic marker should be further verified in GC.

TI The rice white green leaf 2 gene causes defects in chloroplast
   development and affects the plastid ribosomal protein S9
SO RICE
AB Background: Plastid ribosomal proteins (PRPs) play important roles in the translation of key proteins involved in chloroplast development and photosynthesis. PRPs have been widely studied in many plant species; however, few studies have investigated their roles in rice.
   Result: In the present study, we used ethyl methane sulfonate mutagenesis and obtained a novel rice mutant called white green leaf 2 (wgl2). The wgl2 mutants exhibited an albino phenotype from germination through the three-leaf stage, and then gradually transitioned to green through the later developmental stages. Consistent with this albino phenotype, wgl2 mutants had abnormal chloroplasts and lower levels of photosynthetic pigments. Map-based cloning and DNA sequencing analyses of wgl2 revealed a single-nucleotide substitution (G to T) in the first exon of LOC_Os03g55930, which resulted in a substitution of glycine 92 to valine (G92 V). WGL2 encodes a conserved ribosomal protein, which localizes to the chloroplast. Complementation and targeted deletion experiments confirmed that the point mutation in WGL2 is responsible for the wgl2 mutant phenotype. WGL2 is preferentially expressed in the leaf, and mutating WGL2 led to obvious changes in the expression of genes related to chlorophyll biosynthesis, photosynthesis, chloroplast development, and ribosome development compared with wild-type.
   Conclusions: WGL2 encodes a conserved ribosomal protein, which localizes to the chloroplast. WGL2 is essential for early chloroplast development in rice. These results facilitate research that will further uncover the molecular mechanism of chloroplast development.

TI High MRPS23 expression contributes to hepatocellular carcinoma
   proliferation and indicates poor survival outcomes
SO TUMOR BIOLOGY
AB Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most prevalent neoplasms and the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Mitochondrial ribosomal protein S23 is encoded by a nuclear gene and participates in mitochondrial protein translation. Mitochondrial ribosomal protein S23 overexpression has been found in many types of cancer. In this study, we explored mitochondrial ribosomal protein S23 expression in primary hepatocellular carcinoma tissues compared with matched adjacent non-tumoral liver tissues using mitochondrial ribosomal protein S23 messenger RNA and protein levels collected from public databases and clinical samples. Immunohistochemistry was performed to analyze the relationship between mitochondrial ribosomal protein S23 and various clinicopathological features. The results indicated that mitochondrial ribosomal protein S23 was significantly overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma. High mitochondrial ribosomal protein S23 expression was correlated with the tumor size and tumor-metastasis-node stage. Moreover, patients with high mitochondrial ribosomal protein S23 expression levels presented poorer survival rates. Mitochondrial ribosomal protein S23 was an independent prognostic factor for survival, especially at the early stage of hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, the downregulation of mitochondrial ribosomal protein S23 decreased the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, we verified for the first time that mitochondrial ribosomal protein S23 expression was upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma. High mitochondrial ribosomal protein S23 levels can predict poor clinical outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma, and this protein plays a key role in tumor proliferation. Therefore, mitochondrial ribosomal protein S23 may be a potential therapeutic target for hepatocellular carcinoma.

TI Long noncoding RNA AWPPH promotes hepatocellular carcinoma progression
   through YBX1 and serves as a prognostic biomarker
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-MOLECULAR BASIS OF DISEASE
AB Long noncoding RNAs (IncRNAs) have been shown to play important roles in various cancers. However, the clinical significances and biological roles of IncRNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain largely unknown. In this study, using online-available data sets and quantitative real-time PCR, we identified a novel lncRNA termed lncRNA-AWPPH, which is highly expressed in HCC tissues. Its upregulation is correlated with encapsulation incomplete, microvascular invasion, advanced TNM stage and BCLC stage. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis revealed that high lncRNA-AWPPH expression is an independent prognostic factor for poor recurrence-free and overall survival. Functional experiments showed that overexpression of lncRNA-AWPPH promotes HCC cell proliferation and migration in vitro, and tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Conversely, depletion of lncRNA-AWPPH has opposite effects on HCC. Mechanistically, IncRNA-AWPPH interacts with YBX1, promotes YBX1-mediated activation of SNAIL1 translation, and upregulates SNAILI expression. Furthermore, IncRNA-AWPPH promotes YBX1-mediated activation of PIK3CA transcription, upregulates PIK3CA expression, and activates PI3K/AKT pathway. Depletion of YBX1 abolishes the effects of lncRNA-AWPPH on SNAILI and PIK3CA, and also the biological roles of lncRNA-AWPPH on HCC cells. In conclusion, this study identifies a novel IncRNA termed lncRNA-AWPPH which is highly expressed in HCC, indicates poor prognosis of HCC patients, and promotes HCC cell proliferation, migration, and in vivo tumor growth and metastasis via a novel regulatory mechanism of interacting with YBX1.

TI Complexity and regulation of age-dependent alternative splicing in
   Brachypodium distachyon
SO PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
AB Alternative splicing mediated by SC35-LIKE SPLICING FACTOR 33 (SCL33), its putative paralog SCL33L, and miR156 is involved in phase transitions in Brachypodium.
   Alternative splicing (AS) is a gene regulatory mechanism that generates multiple transcripts of the same gene precursor by the spliceosome complex, promoting messenger RNA complexity, and proteome diversity. Although AS is extensively studied in response to environmental stresses, whether it mediates age-dependent development and how it is adjusted by growth transitions are largely unknown. Here, we comprehensively explored the AS landscape at different developmental stages in the grass model plant Brachypodium (Brachypodium distachyon). We identified abundant coding genes and noncoding transcripts subject to dynamic AS regulation during juvenile, adult, and reproductive transitions. Moreover, we revealed that SC35-LIKE SPLICING FACTOR 33 (SCL33), a serine/arginine-rich splicing factor in spliceosomes, plays a redundant and antagonistic role with its putative paralog, SCL33L, in regulating intron assembly across distinct developmental stages. In addition, we determined global AS variations in microRNA156 (miR156)-overproducing plants, in which growth transitions are delayed, and found that SPLs were regulated by miR156 in intron retention alteration in addition to mRNA clearance and translation inhibition manners. Finally, we demonstrated a complex regulatory process of age-dependent AS events in B. distachyon that was coincidently or separately regulated by miR156 and SCL33/SCL33L. These results illustrate a substantial machinery of AS that mediates phase transitions in plants.

TI Artemisinin Bioactivity and Resistance in Malaria Parasites
SO TRENDS IN PARASITOLOGY
AB Artemisinin is the most widely-used compound against malaria and plays a critical role in the treatment of malaria worldwide. Resistance to artemisinin emerged about a decade ago in Southeast Asia and it is paramount to prevent its spread or emergence in Africa. Artemisinin has a complex mode of action and can cause widespread injury to many components of the parasite. In this review, we outline the different metabolic pathways affected by artemisinin, including the unfolded protein response, protein polyubiquitination, proteasome, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha. Based on recently published data, we present a model of how these different pathways interplay and how mutations in K13, the main identified resistance marker, may help parasites survive under artemisinin pressure.

TI A nucleoside diphosphate kinase gene OsNDPK4 is involved in root
   development and defense responses in rice (Oryza sativa L.)
SO PLANTA
AB Main conclusion Dysfunctional mutation of OsNDPK4 resulted in severe defects in root development of rice. However, the resistance of Osndpk4 against bacterial blight was significantly enhanced. Nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDPKs) are an evolutionarily conserved family of important enzymes balancing the energy currency nucleoside triphosphates by catalyzing the transfer of their phosphate groups. The aim of this study was to elucidate the function of OsNDPK4 in rice. A dysfunctional rice mutant was employed to characterize the function of OsNDPK4. Its expression and subcellular localization were examined. The transcriptomic change in roots of Osndpk4 was analyzed by RNA-seq. The rice mutant Osndpk4 showed severe defects in root development from the early seedling stage. Further analysis revealed that meristematic activity and cell elongation were significantly inhibited in primary roots of Osndpk4, together with reduced accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Map-based cloning identified that the mutation occurred in the OsNDPK4 gene. OsNDPK4 was found to be expressed in a variety of tissues throughout the plant and OsNDPK4 was located in the cytosol. Osndpk4 showed enhanced resistance to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and up-regulation of pathogenesis-related marker genes. In addition, transcriptomic analysis showed that OsNDPK4 was significantly associated with a number of biological processes, including translation, protein modification, metabolism, biotic stress response, etc. Detailed analysis revealed that the dysfunction of OsNDPK4 might reorchestrate energy homeostasis and hormone metabolism and signalling, resulting in repression of translation, DNA replication and cell cycle progression, and priming of biotic stress defense. Our results demonstrate that OsNDPK4 plays important roles in energy homeostasis, development process, and defense responses in rice.

TI The D.R.E.A.M. program: developing resilience through emotions,
   attitudes, & meaning (gifted edition) - a second wave positive
   psychology approach
SO COUNSELLING PSYCHOLOGY QUARTERLY
AB Up to 20% of children and youth, in general, experience significant emotional, behavioural, or social challenges, while 30% to 40% of gifted children can be identified with noteworthy difficulties in these areas. Such concerns may hinder their positive development, personal life trajectory, academic success, and inhibit gifted individuals from meeting their potential. Despite this, to date, no evidence-based, educational socio-emotional (SEL) programs exist to meet the unique needs of gifted school children. In collaboration with knowledge-users, namely gifted children, as well as their parents and teachers, we have created the D.R.E.A.M. (Developing Resilience through Emotions, Attitudes, and Meaning) program grounded in a Second Wave Positive Psychology approach called R.E.A.L. (Rational Emotive Attachment Logotherapy). The D.R.E.A.M. program uses original songs, crafts, drama, discussions, stories, and games to teach skills for resilience. The pilot program was evaluated through a Knowledge Translation-Integrated approach and was found to be acceptable to knowledge-users, feasible to implement, and credible (i.e. the program was found to enhance meaning and mental health). Suggestions for long-term sustainability of the program were also provided by the knowledge-users. Ultimately, through building a sustainable, easy to implement program, we aim to build resilience and enhance gifted children's capacity to reach their potential.

TI Dynamic gene expression profiles during postnatal development of porcine
   subcutaneous adipose
SO PEERJ
AB A better understanding of the control of lipogenesis is of critical importance for both human and animal physiology. This requires a better knowledge of the changes of gene expression during the process of adipose tissue development. Thus, the objective of the current study was to determine the effects of development on subcutaneous adipose tissue gene expression in growing and adult pigs. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of mRNA transcriptomes in porcine subcutaneous adipose tissue across four developmental stages using digital gene expression profiling. We identified 3,274 differential expressed genes associated with oxidative stress, immune processes, apoptosis, energy metabolism, insulin stimulus, cell cycle, angiogenesis and translation. A set of universally abundant genes (ATP8, COX2, COX3, ND1, ND2, SCD and TUBA1B) was found across all four developmental stages. This set of genes may play important roles in lipogenesis and development. We also identified development-related gene expression patterns that are linked to the different adipose phenotypes. We showed that genes enriched in significantly up-regulated profiles were associated with phosphorylation and angiogenesis. In contrast, genes enriched in significantly down-regulated profiles were related to cell cycle and cytoskeleton organization, suggesting an important role for these biological processes in adipose growth and development. These results provide a resource for studying adipose development and promote the pig as a model organism for researching the development of human obesity, as well as being used in the pig industry.

TI Shaw in Mid-Twentieth-Century Iran
SO SHAW-THE JOURNAL OF BERNARD SHAW STUDIES
AB This article explores the reception of Shaw's oeuvre in Iran to analyze the ways in which Iranian readers and audiences have read, understood, and used Shaw's work to comment on Iranian sociopolitical issues. Bozorg Alavi, a founding member of Iran's leading communist party, first introduced Iranian readers to Shaw through his translation of Mrs. Warren's Profession (1928). Since then, Shaw has appeared as a recurring point of reference for intellectuals with leftist sympathies in Iran in their pursuits of a range of reform agendas. This article focuses-specifically on the mid-twentieth century, a politically turbulent time in which much of the resistance movements that led to the 1979 revolution emerged. It uses translations, criticisms, and productions of Shaw's work in addition to original analyses of Shaw's plays in dialogue with Iranian literature and politics to analyze Shaw's presence in debates surrounding issues of gender, national identity, and political freedom.

TI Lope de Vega himself re-writes: from Byzantine comedy to short novel
   (The widow, married and maiden, Guzman the Brave and The prudent
   revenge)
SO BULLETIN OF THE COMEDIANTES
AB I examine how Lope de Vega drew upon an early comedia, La viuda, casada y doncella (1597), in devising two late masterpieces, Guzman el Bravo and La prudente venganza, both printed in La Circe (1624). In particular, my study scrutinizes the ways that the novellas reconfigure episodes from the earlier comedia and traces the literary trail left by the process of rewriting. Three poles of attraction to La viuda, casada y doncella come to light: the comedia's success on stage during two decades; its renewed popularity as a literary work upon publication in the Parte 7 (1617); and the drama's Byzantine plot motifs. Such elements included vertiginous separations and reunions of lovers, storms, shipwrecks, captivity, and other trials-popularized in translations and adaptations of Heliodorus's Aethiopica as well as in Italian novellas and other literary genres-that had become touchstones of Lope's literary practice, anchoring a host of comedias written in the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century, as well as his novel, El peregrino en su patria (1604). Ultimately, this examination of Lope's rewriting-construed as a sustained and deliberate process of self-revision (auto-reescritura)-reveals that the Byzantine motifs adapted from his comedias were decisive in shaping his approach to the novela corta (novella) in the early 1620s.

TI Mechanisms of (photo)toxicity of TiO2 nanomaterials (NM103, NM104,
   NM105): using high-throughput gene expression in Enchytraeus crypticus
SO NANOSCALE
AB Titanium dioxide (TiO2) based nanomaterials (NMs) are among the most produced NMs worldwide. When irradiated with light, particularly UV, TiO2 is photoactive, a property that is explored for several purposes. There are an increasing number of reports on the negative effects of photoactivated TiO2 on non-target organisms. We have here studied the effect of a suite of reference type TiO2 NMs (i.e. NM103, NM104, and NM105 and compared these to the bulk) with and without UV radiation to the oligochaete Enchytraeus crypticus. High-throughput gene expression was used to assess the molecular mechanisms, while also anchoring it to the known effects at the organism level (i.e., reproduction). Results showed that the photoactivity of TiO2 (UV exposed) played a major role in enhancing TiO2 toxicity, activating the transcription of oxidative stress, lysosome damage and apoptosis mechanisms. For non-UV activated TiO2, where toxicity at the organism level (reproduction) was lower, results showed potential for long-term effects (i.e., mutagenic and epigenetic). NM specific mechanisms were identified: NM103 affected transcription and translation, NM104_UV negatively affected the reproductive system/organs, and NM105_UV activated superoxide anion response. Results provided mechanistic information on UV-related phototoxicity of TiO2 materials and evidence for the potential long-term effects.

TI HMGA Proteins in Stemness and Differentiation of Embryonic and Adult
   Stem Cells
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB HMGA1 and HMGA2 are chromatin architectural proteins that do not have transcriptional activity per se, but are able to modify chromatin structure by interacting with the transcriptional machinery and thus negatively or positively regulate the transcription of several genes. They have been extensively studied in cancer where they are often found to be overexpressed but their functions under physiologic conditions have still not been completely addressed. Hmga1 and Hmga2 are expressed during the early stages of mouse development, whereas they are not detectable in most adult tissues. Hmga overexpression or knockout studies in mouse have pointed to a key function in the development of the embryo and of various tissues. HMGA proteins are expressed in embryonic stem cells and in some adult stem cells and numerous experimental data have indicated that they play a fundamental role in the maintenance of stemness and in the regulation of differentiation. In this review, we discuss available experimental data on HMGA1 and HMGA2 functions in governing embryonic and adult stem cell fate. Moreover, based on the available evidence, we will aim to outline how HMGA expression is regulated in different contexts and how these two proteins contribute to the regulation of gene expression and chromatin architecture in stem cells.

TI The necessity of ZSCAN4 for preimplantation development and gene
   expression of bovine embryos
SO JOURNAL OF REPRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Zinc finger and SCAN domain containing 4 (Zscan4) is a gene that is specifically expressed during zygotic genome activation (ZGA) in mouse preimplantation embryos, and a reduction of Zscan4 transcripts leads to developmental failure. In mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), Zscan4 is expressed transiently in as little as 1-5% of the cell population. Zscan4 has also been shown to enhance the efficiency of mouse induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) generation and their quality. Although ZSCAN4 plays important roles in murine embryos and stem cells, its expression and role in bovine embryos is unknown. This study examines ZSCAN4 transcripts in bovine embryos at various developmental stages and attempts to elucidate the functions of ZSCAN4 during bovine preimplantation development. ZSCAN4 transcripts were found to be upregulated at the 8 and 16-cell stages. We next attempted ZSCAN4 downregulation in bovine early embryos by RNA interference and evaluated developmental competency and transcripts levels of genes involved in ZGA and iPSCs generation. Although the bovine embryos injected with ZSCAN4-siRNA could develop to the 8-cell stage, very few were developing beyond the 16-cell stage. PIWIL2 expression was reduced in ZSCAN4 downregulated embryos. It is possible that ZSCAN4 downregulated embryos fail to regulate gene expression during ZGA. Our results indicate that ZSCAN4 is an important factor for the preimplantation development of bovine embryos.

TI Insights into established and emerging roles of SR protein family in
   plants and animals
SO WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-RNA
AB Splicing of pre-mRNA is an essential part of eukaryotic gene expression. Serine-/arginine-rich (SR) proteins are highly conserved RNA-binding proteins present in all metazoans and plants. SR proteins are involved in constitutive and alternative splicing, thereby regulating the transcriptome and proteome diversity in the organism. In addition to their role in splicing, SR proteins are also involved in mRNA export, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, mRNA stability, and translation. Due to their pivotal roles in mRNA metabolism, SR proteins play essential roles in normal growth and development. Hence, any misregulation of this set of proteins causes developmental defects in both plants and animals. SR proteins from the animal kingdom are extensively studied for their canonical and noncanonical functions. Compared with the animal kingdom, plant genomes harbor more SR protein-encoding genes and greater diversity of SR proteins, which are probably evolved for plant-specific functions. Evidence from both plants and animals confirms the essential role of SR proteins as regulators of gene expression influencing cellular processes, developmental stages, and disease conditions.

TI SWCNTs@GQDs composites as nanocarriers for enzyme-free dual-signal
   amplification electrochemical immunoassay of cancer biomarker
SO ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA
AB Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as a typical biomarker plays a remarkable role in various human physiological processes. A sensitive and rapid method should be developed to realize the precise diagnosis of cancer at its early stage. In this work, we successfully synthesized the peroxidase-like graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and utilized it to fabricate an enzyme-free electrochemical immunosensor towards CEA by forming a single-wall carbon nanotubes@GQDs (SWCNTs@GQDs) composite. In addition to the SWCNTs@GQDs, reduced graphene oxide-Au nanoparticles (rGO-Au NPs) with the huge specific surface area and excellent conductivity were employed to modify the electrodes, leading to a dual-signal amplification result. Both the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed to evaluate the interface properties of the layer-by-layer modified electrodes. The proposed electrochemical immunosensor displayed a good specificity and sensitivity towards the detection of CEA ranging from 50 pg mL(-1) to 650 pg mL(-1) with a low detection limit of 5.3 pg mL(-1). This simple and inexpensive immunosensor shows promising potential for the determination of other biomarkers in clinical translation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Developmental Origins of Kidney Disease: Why Oxidative Stress Matters?
SO ANTIOXIDANTS
AB The "developmental origins of health and disease" theory indicates that many adult-onset diseases can originate in the earliest stages of life. The developing kidney has emerged as being particularly vulnerable to adverse in utero conditions leading to morphological and functional changes, namely renal programming. Emerging evidence indicates oxidative stress, an imbalance between reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) and antioxidant systems, plays a pathogenetic role in the developmental programming of kidney disease. Conversely, perinatal use of antioxidants has been implemented to reverse programming processes and prevent adult-onset diseases. We have termed this reprogramming. The focus of this review is twofold: (1) To summarize the current knowledge on oxidative stress implicated in renal programming and kidney disease of developmental origins; and (2) to provide an overview of reprogramming effects of perinatal antioxidant therapy on renal programming and how this may prevent adult-onset kidney disease. Although early-life oxidative stress is implicated in mediating renal programming and adverse offspring renal outcomes, and animal models provide promising results to allow perinatal antioxidants applied as potential reprogramming interventions, it is still awaiting clinical translation. This presents exciting new challenges and areas for future research.

TI Multiple layers of regulation determine the cellular levels of the Pup
   ligase PafA in Mycobacterium smegmatis
SO MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY
AB Despite being a destructive process, regulated protein degradation is fundamental for proper cell function. While regulated proteolysis in eukaryotes largely involves the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), most bacterial species rely on multiple ATP-dependent proteases, such as the Clp proteases. Mycobacteria and related actinobacterial species also possess a degradation system analogous in its function to the UPS. In this system, a prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein (Pup) is conjugated to proteins, thereby marking them for proteasomal degradation. A single ligase, PafA, is responsible for Pup conjugation to many protein targets, thus playing a central role in the Pup-proteasome system (PPS). In Mycobacterium smegmatis, a model mycobacterial organism where the PPS is essential under starvation conditions, cellular PafA levels change in response to nutrient availability. Indeed, increased PafA levels are observed upon nutrient limitation. We found that a multi-layered network involving transcriptional, translational and post-translational regulation determines cellular PafA levels. Induced expression is observed at stationary phase, whereas PafA degradation by the proteasome and ClpCP occurs in exponentially growing cells, as opposed to starved cells. In both growth stages, translation attenuation maintains low PafA expression levels. Altogether, these mechanisms establish the dynamics in PafA levels during bacterial growth.

TI Tuning LeSPL-CNR expression by SlymiR157 affects tomato fruit ripening
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB In plants, microRNAs (miRNAs) play essential roles in growth, development, yield, stress response and interactions with pathogens. However no miRNA has been experimentally documented to be functionally involved in fruit ripening although many miRNAs have been profiled in fruits. Here we show that SlymiR157 and SlymiR156 differentially modulate ripening and softening in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). SlymiR157 is expressed and developmentally regulated in normal tomato fruits and in those of the Colourless non-ripening (Cnr) epimutant. It regulates expression of the key ripening gene LeSPL-CNR in a likely dose-dependent manner through miRNA-induced mRNA degradation and translation repression. Viral delivery of either pre-SlymiR157 or mature SlymiR157 results in delayed ripening. Furthermore, qRT-PCR profiling of key ripening regulatory genes indicates that the SlymiR157-target LeSPL-CNR may affect expression of LeMADS-RIN, LeHB1, SlAP2a and SlTAGL1. However SlymiR156 does not affect the onset of ripening, but it impacts fruit softening after the red ripe stage. Our findings reveal that working together with a ripening network of transcription factors, SlymiR157 and SlymiR156 form a critical additional layer of regulatory control over the fruit ripening process in tomato.

TI Peptide-based nanoprobes for molecular imaging and disease diagnostics
SO CHEMICAL SOCIETY REVIEWS
AB Pathological changes in a diseased site are often accompanied by abnormal activities of various biomolecules in and around the involved cells. Identifying the location and expression levels of these biomolecules could enable early-stage diagnosis of the related disease, the design of an appropriate treatment strategy, and the accurate assessment of the treatment outcomes. Over the past two decades, a great diversity of peptide-based nanoprobes (PBNs) have been developed, aiming to improve the in vitro and in vivo performances of water-soluble molecular probes through engineering of their primary chemical structures as well as the physicochemical properties of their resultant assemblies. In this review, we introduce strategies and approaches adopted for the identification of functional peptides in the context of molecular imaging and disease diagnostics, and then focus our discussion on the design and construction of PBNs capable of navigating through physiological barriers for targeted delivery and improved specificity and sensitivity in recognizing target biomolecules. We highlight the biological and structural roles that low-molecular-weight peptides play in PBN design and provide our perspectives on the future development of PBNs for clinical translation.

TI Spotlight on liver macrophages for halting liver disease progression and
   injury
SO EXPERT OPINION ON THERAPEUTIC TARGETS
AB Introduction Over the past two decades, understanding of hepatic macrophage biology has provided astounding details of their role in the progression and regression of liver diseases. The hepatic macrophages constitute resident macrophages, Kupffer cells, and circulating bone marrow monocyte-derived macrophages, which play a diverse role in liver injury and repair. Imbalance in the macrophage population leads to pathological consequences and is responsible for the initiation and progression of acute and chronic liver injuries. Further, distinct populations of hepatic macrophages and their high heterogeneity make their complex role enigmatic. The unique features of distinct phenotypes of macrophages have provided novel biomarkers for defining the stages of liver diseases. The distinct mechanisms of hepatic macrophages polarization and recruitment have been at the fore front of research. In addition, the secretome of hepatic macrophages and their immune regulation has provided clinically relevant therapeutic targets. Areas covered Herein, we have highlighted the current understanding in the area of hepatic macrophages, and their role in the progression of liver injury. Expert opinion It is essential to ascertain the physiological and pathological role of evolutionarily conserved distinct macrophage phenotypes in different liver diseases before viable approaches may see a clinical translation.

TI Artificial intelligence in oncologic imaging
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY OPEN
AB Radiology is integral to cancer care. Compared to molecular assays, imaging has its advantages. Imaging as a noninvasive tool can assess the entirety of tumor unbiased by sampling error and is routinely acquired at multiple time points in oncological practice. Imaging data can be digitally post-processed for quantitative assessment. The ever-increasing application of Artificial intelligence (AI) to clinical imaging is challenging radiology to become a discipline with competence in data science, which plays an important role in modern oncology. Beyond streamlining certain clinical tasks, the power of AI lies in its ability to reveal previously un-detected or even imperceptible radiographic patterns that may be difficult to ascertain by the human sensory system. Here, we provide a narrative review of the emerging AI applications relevant to the oncological imaging spectrum and elaborate on emerging paradigms and opportunities. We envision that these technical advances will change radiology in the coming years, leading to the optimization of imaging acquisition and discovery of clinically relevant biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, staging, and treatment monitoring. Together, they pave the road for future clinical translation in precision oncology.

TI Poly(A)-binding proteins are required for microRNA-mediated silencing
   and to promote target deadenylation in C. elegans
SO NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH
AB Cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) link mRNA 3' termini to translation initiation factors, but they also play key roles in mRNA regulation and decay. Reports from mice, zebrafish and Drosophila further involved PABPs in microRNA (miRNA)-mediated silencing, but through seemingly distinct mechanisms. Here, we implicate the two Caenorhabditis elegans PABPs (PAB-1 and PAB-2) in miRNA-mediated silencing, and elucidate their mechanisms of action using concerted genetics, protein interaction analyses, and cell-free assays. We find that C. elegans PABPs are required for miRNA-mediated silencing in embryonic and larval developmental stages, where they act through a multi-faceted mechanism. Depletion of PAB-1 and PAB-2 results in loss of both poly(A)-dependent and -independent translational silencing. PABPs accelerate miRNA-mediated deadenylation, but this contribution can be modulated by 3'UTR sequences. While greater distances with the poly(A) tail exacerbate dependency on PABP for deadenylation, more potent miRNA-binding sites partially suppress this effect. Our results refine the roles of PABPs in miRNA-mediated silencing and support a model wherein they enable miRNA-binding sites by looping the 3'UTR poly(A) tail to the bound miRISC and deadenylase.

TI Comprehensive analysis of the expression and prognostic value of CXC
   chemokines in colorectal cancer
SO INTERNATIONAL IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY
AB The C-X-C motif (CXC) chemokines play an important role in inflammatory processes and angiogenesis and are also associated with tumor development, progression and metastasis. They can be either promoting or inhibiting factors in colorectal cancers (CRC). The expression patterns and prognostic values of the CXC family still need further investigation. In this study, we investigated data related to transcription, translation, survival and tumor immune infiltration for CXC chemokines in patients with CRC from the ONCOMINE, GEPIA, cBioPortal, HPA and TIMER databases. We found that the expression levels of CXCL1-3, CXCL5, and CXCL8 were higher in CRC tissues than in colorectal tissues. Expression among stages significantly varied for CXCL1-3 and CXCL9-11. The survival analysis revealed that high transcriptional levels of CXCL4 and CXCL9-11 could serve as positive prognostic factors for patients with CRC. CXCL9-11 were highly associated with CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells in the tumor immune infiltration analysis, indicating their role in the antitumor immune response. This study implies that CXCL1-3, CXCL5, and CXCL8 are important factors during CRC oncogenesis and that CXCL9-11 could be new biomarkers for the prognosis of CRC.

AB It is now over 25 years since the term proteomics (analysis of the entire protein complement of a cell, tissue, or organism under a specific, defined set of conditions) was originally coined. Since then, the field has advanced rapidly and there are now more than 135,500 publications addressing the field. With current instrumentation it is possible to detect over 10,000 protein forms in a single experiment. The separation of proteins and peptides has been a key component of many of these studies for both sample concentration and enrichment and to reduce the complexity of the samples under analysis, allowing deeper mining of the individual proteomes. In this review, the roles of chromatography, electrophoresis, and other allied techniques in the advancement of the field will be investigated. Key technologies will be presented, and examples given of their application showing how the field has now advanced to a stage where it is enhancing our understanding of the human biology underlying health and disease, and clinical translation, supporting precision/personalized medicine, is now feasible. Clearly the separation sciences have played a key role in many of these advances.

TI Role of human heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C1/C2 in dengue
   virus replication
SO VIROLOGY JOURNAL
AB Background: Host and viral proteins are involved in dengue virus (DENV) replication. Heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) C1/C2 are abundant host cellular proteins that exhibit RNA binding activity and play important roles in the replication of positive-strand RNA viruses such as poliovirus and hepatitis C virus. hnRNP C1/C2 have previously been shown to interact with vimentin and viral NS1 in DENV-infected cells; however, their functional role in DENV replication is not clearly understood. In the present study, we investigated the role of hnRNP C1/C2 in DENV replication by using an in vitro model of DENV infection in a hepatocyte cell line (Huh7) and siRNA-mediated knockdown of hnRNP C1/C2.
   Methods: Huh7 cells were transfected with hnRNP C1/C2-specific siRNA or irrelevant siRNA (control) followed by infection with DENV. Mock and DENV-infected knockdown cells were processed for immunoprecipitation using hnRNP C1/C2-specific antibody or their isotype-matched control antibody. The immunoprecipitated samples were subjected to RNA extraction and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detection of DENV RNA. In addition, the knockdown cells harvested at varying time points after the infection were assessed for cell viability, cell proliferation, percentage of DENV infection, amount of viral RNA, and viral E and NS1 expression. Culture supernatants were subjected to focus forming unit assays to determine titers of infectious DENV. DENV luciferase reporter assay was also set up to determine viral translation.
   Results: Immunoprecipitation with the anti-hnRNP C1/C2 antibody and subsequent RT-PCR revealed the presence of DENV RNA in the immunoprecipitated complex containing hnRNP C1/C2 proteins. Transfection with hnRNP C1/C2-specific siRNA resulted in a significant reduction of hnRNP C1/C2 mRNA and protein levels but did not induce cell death during DENV infection. The reduced hnRNP C1/C2 expression decreased the percentage of DENV antigen-positive cells as well as the amount of DENV RNA and the relative levels of DENV E and NS1 proteins; however, it had no direct effect on DENV translation. In addition, a significant reduction of DENV titers was observed in the supernatant from DENV-infected cells following the knockdown of hnRNP C1/C2.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that hnRNP C1/C2 is involved in DENV replication at the stage of viral RNA synthesis.

TI Protein composition of the occlusion bodies of Epinotia aporema
   granulovirus
SO PLOS ONE
AB Within family Baculoviridae, members of the Betabaculovirus genus are employed as bio-control agents against lepidopteran pests, either alone or in combination with selected members of the Alphabaculovirus genus. Epinotia aporema granulovirus (EpapGV) is a fast killing betabaculovirus that infects the bean shoot borer (E. aporema) and is a promising bio-pesticide. Because occlusion bodies (OBs) play a key role in baculovirus horizontal transmission, we investigated the composition of EpapGV OBs. Using mass spectrometry-based proteomics we could identify 56 proteins that are included in the OBs during the final stages of larval infection. Our data provides experimental validation of several annotated hypothetical coding sequences. Proteogenomic mapping against genomic sequence detected a previously unannotated ac 110-like core gene and a putative translation fusion product of ORFs epap48 and epap49. Comparative studies of the proteomes available for the family Baculoviridae highlight the conservation of core gene products as parts of the occluded virion. Two proteins specific for betabaculoviruses (Epap48 and Epap95) are incorporated into OBs. Moreover, quantification based on emPAI values showed that Epap95 is one of the most abundant components of EpapGV OBs.

TI Hypoxia stimulates the cytoplasmic localization of oncogenic long
   noncoding RNA LINC00152 in colorectal cancer
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY
AB Recent studies have indicated that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a pivotal role in almost all physiological cellular processes, including every stage of cancer development. Given that hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment is involved in the malignant behavior of tumors, such as invasion and metastasis, we investigated the cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of lncRNAs in colorectal cancer cells. A cell culture under hypoxic conditions revealed several lncRNAs, such as LINC00152, whose levels were increased in the cytoplasm of colorectal cancer cells. A database study indicated that LINC00152 shares microRNA-binding sites, such as miR-138 and miR-193, with the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1), thus suggesting that LINC00152 could possibly function as a competing endogenous RNA that can augment Hif1 translation in the cytoplasm of hypoxic colorectal cancer cells. Moreover, the data presented in the studies of surgically resected samples showed that patients with colorectal cancer exhibiting high LINC00152 expression were associated with a worsened survival rate; this supports the suggested oncogenic function of LINC00152 in the cytoplasm under hypoxic conditions. The present study demonstrated that lncRNA networks could provide diagnostic tools and novel therapeutic targets against colorectal cancer cells.

TI Exon skipping in IspE Gene is associated with abnormal chloroplast
   development in rice albino leaf 4 mutant
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB The formation of leaf color largely depends on the components of pigment accumulation in plastids, which are involved in chloroplast development and division. Here, we isolated and characterized the rice albino leaf 4 (al4) mutant, which exhibited an albino phenotype and eventually died at the three-leaf stage. The chloroplasts in al4 mutant were severely damaged and unable to form intact thylakoid structure. Further analysis revealed that the candidate gene encodes 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase (IspE), which participates in the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis. We further demonstrated that the mutation at the exon-intron junction site cause alternative splicing factors fail to distinguish the origin of the GT-AG intron, leading to exon skipping and producing a truncated OsIspE in the al4 mutant. Notably, disruption of OsIspE led to the reduced expression of chloroplast-associated genes, including chloroplast biosynthetic and translation related genes and photosynthetic associated nuclear genes (PhANGs). In summary, these findings reveal that OsIspE plays a crucial role in chloroplast biogenesis and provides novel insights into the function of CMK during chloroplast development in rice.

TI MicroRNA and Putative Target Discoveries in Chrysanthemum Polyploidy
   Breeding
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENOMICS
AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs), around 22 nucleotides (nt) in length, are a class of endogenous and noncoding RNA molecule that play an essential role in plant development, either by suppressing the transcription of target genes at a transcriptional level or inhibiting translation at a posttranscriptional level. To understand the roles of miRNAs and their target genes in chrysanthemum polyploidy breeding, three sRNA libraries of normal and abnormal embryos after hybridization were performed by RNA-Seq. As a result, a total of 170 miRNAs were identified and there are 41 special miRNAs in cross of paternal chromosome doubling, such as miR169b, miR440, and miR528-5p. miR164c and miR159a were highly expressed in a normal embryo at 18 days after pollination, suggesting the regulatory role at the late stage of embryonic development. miR172c was only detected in the normal embryo at 18 days after pollination, which means that miR172c mainly mediates gene expression in postembryonic development and these genes may promote embryo maturation. Other miRNAs, including miR414, miR2661, and miR5021, may regulate the genes participated in pathways of auxin response and energy metabolism; then they regulate the complex embryonic development together.

   COMMUNICATION
AB Chronicles are a type of narrative fiction published as serial stories on the internet (Facebook, Wattpad, etc.). Written by young people of various origins, most often from post-colonial migrations, they describe the daily life in the plurilingual and pluricultural universe of the outskirts of cities. The discourse of linguistic heterogeneity is studied in the discursive spaces (ie the multimodal narrative fiction itself and the exchanges with the readers that surround it) of 16 chronicles. The naming of languages and other forms used to refer to otherness in discourse (translation, metalinguistic comments, typographical games, etc.) are analyzed. The effects sought by these games of linguistic heterogeneity shown in discourse are then studied. Beyond the "effect of reality" linked to the staging of the multilingual urban environment, they allow the construction of an ethos (said and shown) of a multilingual speaker/writer, the narration of interactions with friends and family where languages play a central role in the construction of relationships and identities and finally the development of complex identity games, within digital interactions with readers. The heterogeneity of the repertoires appears to be strongly thematized in these discursive spaces where it is considered as a shared wealth.

TI Practical Issues with the Use of Stem Cells for Cancer Gene Therapy
SO STEM CELL REVIEWS AND REPORTS
AB Stem cell-based drug delivery for cancer therapy has steadily gained momentum in the past decade as several studies have reported stem cells' inherent tropism towards tumors. Since this science is still in its early stages and there are many factors that could significantly impact tumor tropism of stem cells, some contradictory results have been observed. This review starts by examining a number of proof-of-concept studies that demonstrate the potential application of stem cells in cancer therapy. Studies that illustrate stem cells' tumor tropism and discuss the technical difficulties that could impact the therapeutic outcome are also highlighted. The discussion also emphasizes stem cell imaging/tracking, as it plays a crucial role in performing reliable dose-response studies and evaluating the therapeutic outcome of treatment protocols. In each section, the pros and cons associated with each method are highlighted, limitations are underlined, and potential solutions are discussed. The overall intention is to familiarize the reader with important practical issues related to stem cell cancer tropism and in vivo tracking, underline the shortcomings, and emphasize critical factors that need to be considered for effective translation of this science into the clinic.

TI Spectacle Korea: Transfiguring National Boundaries, Trans-imaging
   National Culture in the Case of The Good, the Bad, the Weird
SO CONCENTRIC-LITERARY AND CULTURAL STUDIES
AB In this essay I explore the Korean blockbuster, a film genre that enjoyed popularity in South Korea as a local translation of the Hollywood blockbuster. In examining this hybrid cinematic form, I focus on the cultural dynamics informing the genre's ambivalent-at times even contradictory-aspirations to globalization and localization, with both trends accelerating in Korea. As a particularly poignant blockbuster film, The Good, the Bad, the Weird (dir. Jeewoon Kim, 2008) may well showcase and expand this complicated equation, particularly through its apparent adoption of several genres, including the Manchurian Western. As a Korean sub-genre that was popular in the 1960s, Manchurian Westerns stage Manchuria of the 1930s, in which the Korean people's fight for the nation's liberation from Japanese occupation played out in part, thus inevitably converging on the theme of mimicry and post-colonialism that has emblematized the Korean blockbuster's genre-defining desire. In an attempt to understand the intercultural dynamics that inform this hybrid genre, I rely on contemporary post-colonial theory and film genre theories. I illustrate how this film-and the Korean blockbuster more generally-interplays with ever-changing notions of Korean national boundaries and Koreanness today.

TI Positron emission tomography in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: Towards
   targeting of molecular pathological hallmarks
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
AB During the past decades, extensive efforts have been made to expand the knowledge of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, clinical translation of this research, in terms of earlier diagnosis and improved therapy, remains challenging. Since more than 30% of motor neurons are lost when symptoms become clinically apparent, techniques allowing non-invasive, in vivo detection of motor neuron degeneration are needed in the early, pre-symptomatic disease stage. Furthermore, it has become apparent that non-motor signs play an important role in the disease and there is an overlap with cognitive disorders, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Radionuclide imaging, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), form an attractive approach to quantitatively monitor the ongoing neurodegenerative processes. Although [F-18]-FDG has been recently proposed as a potential biomarker for ALS, active targeting of the underlying pathologic molecular processes is likely to unravel further valuable disease information and may help to decipher the pathogenesis of ALS. In this review, we provide an overview of radiotracers that have already been applied in ALS and discuss possible novel targets for in vivo imaging of various pathogenic processes underlying ALS onset and progression.

TI TGF-beta Signaling
SO BIOMOLECULES
AB Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) represents an evolutionarily conserved family of secreted polypeptide factors that regulate many aspects of physiological embryogenesis and adult tissue homeostasis. The TGF-beta family members are also involved in pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie many diseases. Although the family comprises many factors, which exhibit cell type-specific and developmental stage-dependent biological actions, they all signal via conserved signaling pathways. The signaling mechanisms of the TGF-beta family are controlled at the extracellular level, where ligand secretion, deposition to the extracellular matrix and activation prior to signaling play important roles. At the plasma membrane level, TGF-beta s associate with receptor kinases that mediate phosphorylation-dependent signaling to downstream mediators, mainly the SMAD proteins, and mediate oligomerization-dependent signaling to ubiquitin ligases and intracellular protein kinases. The interplay between SMADs and other signaling proteins mediate regulatory signals that control expression of target genes, RNA processing at multiple levels, mRNA translation and nuclear or cytoplasmic protein regulation. This article emphasizes signaling mechanisms and the importance of biochemical control in executing biological functions by the prototype member of the family, TGF-beta.

AB Readers are invited to the first Russian translation of extracts from the first chapter of the sixth part Datong shu (The Book of the Great Unity) by Kang Youwei (1858-1927). The famous Chinese thinker and outstanding reformer played a prominent role in the process of incorporating traditional Chinese culture into the global context and personally did a lot for a lively dialogue with the Western civilization. Between 1899 and 1913 Kang visited more than 30 countries and made three round-the-world travels. In his multifaceted treatise "Datong shu", a special place was occupied by a description of the historical concept of the Three Eras, in accordance with which value systems, religions and social institutions were considered. Evolutionary sequence was thought in both spatial and temporal aspects. Kang Youwei considered his contemporaneity as a transitional stage from the Era of chaos to the Era of rising equilibrium, the threshold of which reached the most advanced Western societies. However, in an emotional sense, Kang Youwei resolutely defended himself the traditional Chinese clan system, which, as he understood it, opposed an atomized Western society dominated by hedonistic values.

SO JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS
AB Imaging of vascular networks on small animals has played an important role in basic biomedical research. Photoacoustic imaging technology has great potential for application in the imageology of small animals. The wide-field photoacoustic imaging of small animals can provide images with high spatiotemporal resolution, deep penetration, and multiple contrasts. Also, the real-time photoacoustic imaging system is desirable to observe the hemodynamic activities of small-animal vasculature, which can be used to research the dynamic monitoring of small-animal physiological features. Here, a dual-raster-scanning photoacoustic imager is presented, featuring a switchable double-mode imaging function. The wide-field imaging is driven by a two-dimensional motorized translation stage, while the real-time imaging is realized with galvanometers. By setting different parameters and imaging modes, in vivo visualization of small-animal vascular network can be performed. The real-time imaging can be used to observe pulse change and blood flow change of drug-induced, etc. The wide-field imaging can be used to track the growth change of tumor vasculature. These are easy to be adopted in various areas of basic biomedicine research.

TI The road-map for establishment of a prognostic molecular marker panel in
   glioma using liquid biopsy: current status and future directions
SO CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY
AB Gliomas are primary intracranial tumors with defined molecular markers available for precise diagnosis. The prognosis of glioma is bleak as there is an overlook of the dynamic crosstalk between tumor cells and components of the microenvironment. Herein, different phases of gliomagenesis are presented with reference to the role and involvement of secreted proteomic markers at various stages of tumor initiation and development. The secreted markers of inflammatory response, namely interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-Upsilon, and kynurenine, proliferation markers human telomerase reverse transcriptase and microtubule-associated-protein-Tau, and stemness marker human-mobility-group-AThook-1 are involved in glial tumor initiation and growth. Further, hypoxia and angiogenic factors, heat-shock-protein-70, endothelial-growth-factor-receptor-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor play a major role in promoting vascularization and tumor volume expansion. Eventually, molecules such as matrix-metalloprotease-7 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 contribute to the degradation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix, ultimately leading to glioma progression. Our study delineates the roadmap to develop and evaluate a non-invasive panel of secreted biomarkers using liquid biopsy for precisely evaluating disease progression, to accomplish a clinical translation.

TI Residual shear strength of unsaturated soils via suction-controlled ring
   shear testing
SO ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
AB Results from a comprehensive series of suction-controlled ring shear tests, conducted on statically compacted specimens of silty clayey sand and silty sand, are presented. The experiments were accomplished in a newly developed servo/suction-controlled ring shear apparatus suitable for testing unsaturated soils under large deformations and suction-controlled conditions via the axis-translation technique. The present work focuses primarily on two crucial aspects of compacted unsaturated soil behavior, namely, the behavior of silty clayey sand under suction-controlled ring shear testing, and the effects of pre-shearing and suction histories on unsaturated residual shear strength of compacted silty sand. Test results corroborate the important role played by matric suction on residual shear strength properties of unsaturated soils. For the range of net normal stresses and suction states investigated, the increase in residual shear strength with increasing suction was confirmed to be a linear trend for silty sand, but significantly nonlinear for silty clayey sand. Results from multi-stage ring shear tests confirmed that the residual shear strength of unsaturated soils is virtually independent of the pre-shearing and suction histories experienced by the soil.

TI The m(6)A epitranscriptome on neural development and degeneration
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL SCIENCE
AB N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most prevalent, conserved, and abundant RNA modification of the mRNAs of most eukaryotes, including mammals. Similar to epigenetic DNA modifications, m(6)A has been proposed to function as a critical regulator for gene expression. This modification is installed by m(6)A methylation "writers" (Mettl3/Mettl14 methyltransferase complex), and it can be reversed by demethylase "erasers" (Fto and Alkbh5). Furthermore, m(6)A can be recognized by "readers" (Ythdf and Ythdc families), which may be interpreted to affect mRNA splicing, stability, translation or localization. Levels of m(6)A methylation appear to be highest in the brain, where it plays important functions during embryonic stem cell differentiation, brain development, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Depletion of the m(6)A methylation writer Mettl14 from mouse embryonic nervous systems prolongs cell cycle progression of radial glia and extends cortical neurogenesis into postnatal stages. Recent studies further imply that dysregulated m(6)A methylation may be significantly correlated with neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we give an overview of m(6)A modifications during neural development and associated disorders, and provide perspectives for studying m(6)A methylation.

TI Near-Infrared Road-Marking Detection Based on a Modified Faster Regional
   Convolutional Neural Network
SO JOURNAL OF SENSORS
AB Pedestrians, motorist, and cyclist remain the victims of poor vision and negligence of human drivers, especially in the night. Millions of people die or sustain physical injury yearly as a result of traffic accidents. Detection and recognition of road markings play a vital role in many applications such as traffic surveillance and autonomous driving. In this study, we have trained a nighttime road-marking detection model using NIR camera images. We have modified the VGG-16 base network of the state-of-the-art faster R-CNN algorithm by using a multilayer feature fusion technique. We have demonstrated another promising feature fusion technique of concatenating all the convolutional layers within a stage to extract image features. The modification boosts the overall detection performance of the model by utilizing the advantages of the shallow layers and the deep layers of the VGG-16 network. The training samples were augmented using random rotation and translation to enhance the heterogeneity of the detection algorithm. We have achieved a mean average precision (mAP) of 89.48% and 92.83% for the baseline faster R-CNN and our modified method, respectively.

AB X-ray mirrors are widely used in beamlines and laboratories as focusing or collimating optics. As well as the highly accurate processes used to fabricate them, optimized alignment of X-ray mirrors also plays an important role in achieving an ideal X-ray beam. Currently, knife-edge scans are the most often used method for aligning X-ray mirrors, which can characterize the focal size and tune the alignment iteratively. However, knife-edge scanning provides only one-dimensional information and this method suffers from being time-consuming and requiring a high-resolution piezo translation stage. Here we describe a straightforward and non-iterative method for mirror alignment by measuring the relationship between the tilt aberration and the misaligned pitch angle, which is retrieved by an at-wavelength metrology technique using a randomly shaped wavefront modulator. Software and a graphical user interface have been developed to automate the alignment process. Combining the user-friendly interface and the flexibility of the at-wavelength metrology technique, we believe the proposed method and software can benefit researchers working at synchrotron facilities and on laboratory sources.

TI Path from schizophrenia genomics to biology: gene regulation and
   perturbation in neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells and
   genome editing
SO NEUROSCIENCE BULLETIN
AB Schizophrenia (SZ) is a devastating mental disorder afflicting 1% of the population. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of SZ have identified > 100 risk loci. However, the causal variants/genes and the causal mechanisms remain largely unknown, which hinders the translation of GWAS findings into disease biology and drug targets. Most risk variants are noncoding, thus likely regulate gene expression. A major mechanism of transcriptional regulation is chromatin remodeling, and open chromatin is a versatile predictor of regulatory sequences. MicroRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation plays an important role in SZ pathogenesis. Neurons differentiated from patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide an experimental model to characterize the genetic perturbation of regulatory variants that are often specific to cell type and/or developmental stage. The emerging genome-editing technology enables the creation of isogenic iPSCs and neurons to efficiently characterize the effects of SZ-associated regulatory variants on SZ-relevant molecular and cellular phenotypes involving dopaminergic, glutamatergic, and GABAergic neurotransmissions. SZ GWAS findings equipped with the emerging functional genomics approaches provide an unprecedented opportunity for understanding new disease biology and identifying novel drug targets.

TI The Genomic Structure and Expression Patterns of Cyp19a1a and Cyp19a1b
   Genes in the Ayu Plecoglossus altivelis
SO TURKISH JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
AB Here, we report the genomic structure and expression pattern of the cyp19a1a and cyp19a1b of ayu. The cDNAs of cyp19a1a and cyp19a1b coded 529 and 540 amino acid residues with a similarity of 76% and 77% with Salmo trutta (cyp19a1a) and Oncorhynchus mykiss (cyp19a1b), respectively. Genomic structure analysis revealed that ayu cyp19a1a and cyp19a1b genes contained six and seven introns, respectively. The insert sites of cyp19a1b agreed with other fish species, while that of cyp19a1a varied slightly. Sequence analysis of the 5'-flank region showed that the coding start sites were 71 bp and 72 bp from the translation start sites (TSS) of cyp19a1a and cyp19a1b, respectively. The expression patterns of cyp19a1a and cyp19a1b in adult ayu tissues were same as most teleostomi. cyp19a1a was predominantly expressed in the ovary and female brain. Unexpectedly, cyp19a1a also expressed strongly in the muscle. However, cyp19a1b was predominantly expressed in the brain. The expression patterns of ayu embryos and juveniles revealed that cyp19a1a expression fluctuated significantly during ovarian differentiation, while cyp19a1b showed no significant variations during this stage. Based on our data, cyp19a1a might play an important role in gonad differentiation and cyp19a1b might involve in the development of ayu nervous system.

TI Luis Frois, Gendered Knowledge, and the Jesuit Encounter with
   Sixteenth-Century Japan
SO HISTORICAL JOURNAL
AB This article argues that our understanding of the sixteenth-century Jesuit encounter with Japan is improved by taking into account the role gender played in cultural translation. Recent histories of the mission and the writings it produced have highlighted the strategies adopted by Jesuits to rely on and manipulate knowledge of local cultures to facilitate conversion. Yet, few scholars have used gender as a lens to read the actions and ethnographies performed and produced by Jesuits in overseas missions. Using Luis Frois's Tratado das contradicoes e diferencas de costumes entre a Europa e o Japao (Treaty on the contrasts and differences between Europe and Japan), I argue that skilled cultural interpreters used gender as a determining lens to approach the primary task of conversion, but also the secondary task of cultural mediation. Unlike the invasion of the Americas, the ephemeral infiltration of Asia was accomplished through European accommodation of Asian political vocabularies and conduct. Examining the epistemological tools Frois used to build knowledge of the Other sheds light on the initial stages of the unequal encounter between the Japanese and the Jesuits and how it changed based on a growing understanding of Japanese politics, class, and society.

TI Shane Description and Retrieval Using included-Angular Ternary Pattern
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS
AB Shape description is an important and fundamental issue in content-based image retrieval (CBIR), and a number of shape description methods have been reported in the literature. For shape description, both global information and local contour variations play important roles. In this paper a new included-angular ternary pattern (IATP) based shape descriptor is proposed for shape image retrieval. For each point on the shape contour, IATP is derived from its neighbor points, and IATP has good properties for shape description. IATP is intrinsically invariant to rotation, translation and scaling. To enhance the description capability, multiscale IATP histogram is presented to describe both local and global information of shape. Then multiscale IATP histogram is combined with included-angular histogram for efficient shape retrieval. In the matching stage, cosine distance is used to measure shape features' similarity. Image retrieval experiments are conducted on the standard MPEG-7 shape database and Swedish leaf database. And the shape image retrieval performance of the proposed method is compared with other shape descriptors using the standard evaluation method. The experimental results of shape retrieval indicate that the proposed method reaches higher precision at the same recall value compared with other description method.

TI Novel species-specific glycoprotein on the surface of Mytilus edulis and
   M-trossulus eggs
SO INVERTEBRATE REPRODUCTION & DEVELOPMENT
AB Protein-protein interactions play a central role in the gamete attraction, binding, and fusion stages of gamete interactions and fertilization for broadcast spawning species, such as marine mussels in the Mytilus edulis species complex. Although assortative gamete interaction has been implicated in the level of reproductive isolation among the three species in this complex, the molecular basis of these interactions has not been elucidated. Using mass spectrometry peptide sequencing, cDNA sequencing, and bioinformatics approaches, we have investigated species-level variation in the proteins expressed on the surface of mussel eggs. We herein describe an extracellular protein, MESP-1, from the surface of the eggs of M. edulis and M. trossulus that has a unique domain structure when compared to protein structures that have heretofore been identified. Given variation in the size of MESP-1 predicted from cDNA sequences versus those estimated from SDS-PAGE gels, we conclude this protein is subject to significant species-specific post-translation modifications. Further, bioinformatic analysis of the novel structure of MESP-1 suggests that this protein may be an integral membrane protein involved in sperm-egg fusion, and/or released to the vitelline envelope.

TI Elevated expression of G3BP1 associates with YB1 and p-AKT and predicts
   poor prognosis in nonsmall cell lung cancer patients after surgical
   resection
SO CANCER MEDICINE
AB Purpose G3BP1 is an RNA-binding protein and plays roles in regulating signaling pathway. YB-1 is a DNA/RNA binding protein encoded by YBX1 gene. Phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) acts as a pivotal molecule in PI3K/AKT pathway. YB-1 drives stress granules (SGs) formation by activating G3BP1 translation under diverse conditions. SGs are involved in many different metabolic and signaling pathways which may include PI3K/AKT/mTOR. So far, there has been no report on the relationship between expression of G3BP1, p-AKT, and YB1 and clinicopathological features/prognosis in surgically resected nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Methods In this study, data from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) were downloaded to investigate the mRNA expression of G3BP1 and YB1 (YBX1) and their correlation in NSCLC. Also, expression of G3BP1, YB1, and p-AKT proteins was studied using immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays of NSCLC and in noncancerous lung tissues. Results We found that the mRNA expression of G3BP1 and YB1 was higher in NSCLC tissues (both P .05), and G3BP1 was positively correlated with YB1 in mRNA level (r = .399, P < .001). Also, expression of G3BP1, YB1, and p-AKT proteins was higher in NSCLC tissues (all P < .05). And higher expression of G3BP1 and YB1 proteins was seen in patients with clinical stage II and III compared with stage I (both P < .05). Besides, expression of G3BP1 protein had a positive correlation with YB1 and p-AKT (both P < .05). Moreover, overall survival was shorter in patients with overexpression of G3BP1, YB1, and p-AKT proteins (all P < .05). Multivariate analysis confirmed that overexpression of G3BP1 protein was an independent poorer prognostic factor for NSCLC patients (P = .039). Conclusion G3BP1 may play a crucial role in activating PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. G3BP1 might be served as a novel prognostic biomarker for surgically resected NSCLC patients, which afforded new insights into the study on the mechanism and therapy of NSCLC.

TI Insight into the Regulatory Relationships between the Insulin-Like
   Androgenic Gland Hormone Gene and the Insulin-Like Androgenic Gland
   Hormone-binding Protein Gene in Giant Freshwater Prawns (Macrobrachium
   rosenbergii)
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB Giant freshwater prawns (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) are commonly found throughout the world. The size of the male giant freshwater prawn is much larger than that of the female. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanism that underlies the sexual differentiation ofM. rosenbergiiis of both commercial and scientific importance. Insulin-like androgenic gland hormone (IAG) plays a key role in the differentiation of sex inM. rosenbergii. Although IAG has been investigated, the regulatory relationship between IAG and its binding protein partner, the insulin-like androgenic gland hormone-binding protein (IAGBP), has not been studied inM. rosenbergii. Here, we cloned and characterized theIAGBPfromM. rosenbergii(Mr-IAGBP) for the very first time. Transcriptomic analysis showed thatMr-IAGBPmRNA was detected in a wide array of tissues with the highest expression found in the androgenic gland. The importance ofIAGin male development was further demonstrated by an increase inIAGtranscripts during the development of the androgenic gland andMr-IAGwas only highly transcribed in the androgenic gland ofM. rosenbergii. Interestingly, we found that theMr-IAGgene expression started during the 20th-day larva after hatching stage (LH20), followed (20th-day post-larval stage, PL20) by a gradual elevation ofMr-IAGBPlevels. The levels of both genes peaked at the adult stage. The relationship betweenMr-IAGBPandMr-IAGwas further analyzed using RNA interference. The injection ofMr-IAGBPdouble-stranded RNA (dsRNA) significantly reduced the transcription ofMr-IAG, while the amount ofMr-IAGBPmRNA and the translation of IAGBP protein was significantly reduced by the injection ofMr-IAGdsRNA. These results revealed that IAGBP is involved in IAG signaling. Furthermore, our data supports the hypothesis that (IAG and IAGBP)-IAG receptor signaling schemes exist inM. rosenbergii. Our results will provide important information for the further study of determining the sex ofM. rosenbergii.

TI Mutation spectrum of germline cancer susceptibility genes among
   unselected Chinese colorectal cancer patients
SO CANCER MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH
AB Background: Genetic factors play an important role in colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, yet the prevalence and spectrum of germline cancer susceptibility gene mutations among unselected Chinese CRC patients is largely undetermined.
   Methods: We performed next-generation sequencing with a 73-genes panel and analyzed the prevalence and spectrum of germline mutations in 618 unselected Chinese CRC patients. We classified all identified germline alterations for pathogenicity and calculated the frequencies of pathogenic mutations. Clinical characteristics were assessed by age and mutation status. Protein expressions and interactions of MLH1 missense variants were evaluated by western blot and co- immunoprecipitation.
   Results: Overall, 112 (18.1%) of 618 unselected Chinese CRC patients were found to carry at least one pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant (totaling 97 variants), including 70 (11.3%) Lynch syndrome (LS) mutation carriers and 42 (6.8%) non-LS mutation carriers. LS mutation carriers were significantly younger at CRC diagnosis and were more likely to have right-sided, poorly differentiated, early stage, high-frequency microsatellite instability (MSI-H) or dMMR CRC and a family history of cancer compared with noncarriers. Non-LS mutation carriers were more likely to be proficient mismatch repair (pMMR) than noncarriers (p=0.039). We found four clinical variables (gender, tumor histological stage, cancer stage and mutation status) that showed significant differences between patients younger and older than 50 years old. Higher mutation rates were found in patients under 50 years old (p=0.017). Thirty-three novel variants were discovered and evaluated as pathogenic mutations by our study.
   Conclusion: Given the high frequency and wide spectrum of mutations, genetic testing with a multigene panel should be considered for all Chinese CRC patients under 50 years old and is also needed to determine whether a gene is associated with CRC susceptibility and to promote clinical translation.

TI Progress in developing MNK inhibitors
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB The MNKs (mitogen-activated protein kinase-interacting protein kinases) phosphorylate eIF4E (eukaryotic initiation factor 4 E) at serine 209; eIF4E plays an important role in the translation of cytoplasmic mRNAs, all of which possess a 5' 'cap' structure to which eIF4E binds. Elevated levels of eIF4E, p-eIF4E and/or the MNK protein kinases have been found in many types of cancer, including solid tumors and leukemia. MNKs also play a role in metabolic disease. Regulation of the activities of MNKs (MNK1 and MNK2), control the phosphorylation of eIF4E, which in turn has a close relationship with the processes of tumor development, cell migration and invasion, and energy metabolism. MNK knock-out mice display no adverse effects on normal cells or phenotypes suggesting that MNK may be a potentially safe targets for the treatment of various cancers. Several MNK inhibitors or 'degraders' have been identified. Initially, some of the inhibitors were developed from natural products or based on other protein kinase inhibitors which inhibit multiple kinases. Subsequently, more potent and selective inhibitors for MNK1/2 have been designed and synthesized. Currently, three inhibitors (BAY1143269, eFT508 and ETC-206) are in various stages of clinical trials for the treatment of solid cancers or leukemia, either alone or combined with inhibitors of other protein kinase. In this review, we summarize the diverse MNK inhibitors that have been reported in patents and other literature, including those with activities in vitro and/or in vivo. (C) 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI The reckonings of Nahmanides and Arnold of Villanova: on the early
   contacts between Christian millenarianism and Jewish messianism
SO JEWISH HISTORY
AB Historians of the last generation have shown that millenarian circles played a critical role in transforming attitudes towards Jews and Judaism in early modern Europe. Furthermore, the Joachimist leanings that opened the way in early modern times for a rapprochement between Christians and Jews, they found, were already there in the Middle Ages. My aim here is to consider the case of Arnold of Villanova, a lay supporter of the radical Franciscans. A major stimulus for Arnold's eschatological ideas was his wrestling with messianic notions widespread among Jews, especially kabbalists. However, at this early stage, messianic or millenarian expectations were associated, among both Jews and Christians, with a confrontational stance.

TI Cholesterol and Hematopoietic Stem Cells: Inflammatory Mediators of
   Atherosclerosis
SO STEM CELLS TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
AB Atherosclerosis causing heart attack and stroke is the leading cause of death in the modern world. Therapy for end-stage atherosclerotic disease using CD34(+) hematopoietic cells has shown promise in human clinical trials, and the in vivo function of hematopoietic and progenitor cells in atherogenesis is becoming apparent. Inflammation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Cholesterol is a modifiable risk factor in atherosclerosis, but in many patients cholesterol levels are only mildly elevated. Those with high cholesterol levels often have elevated circulating monocyte and neutrophil counts. How cholesterol affects inflammatory cell levels was not well understood. Recent findings have provided new insight into the interaction among hematopoietic stem cells, cholesterol, and atherosclerosis. In mice, high cholesterol levels or inactivation of cholesterol efflux transporters have multiple effects on hematopoietic stem cells (HSPCs), including promoting their mobilization into the bloodstream, increasing proliferation, and differentiating HSPCs to the inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils that participate in atherosclerosis. Increased levels of interleukin-23 (IL-23) stimulate IL-17 production, resulting in granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) secretion, which subsequently leads to HSPC release into the bloodstream. Collectively, these findings clearly link elevated cholesterol levels to increased circulating HSPC levels and differentiation to inflammatory cells that participate in atherosclerosis. Seminal questions remain to be answered to understand how cholesterol affects HSPC-mobilizing cytokines and the role they play in atherosclerosis. Translation of findings in animal models to human subjects may include HSPCs as new targets for therapy to prevent or regress atherosclerosis in patients.

TI Isolation of TSCD11 Gene for Early Chloroplast Development under High
   Temperature in Rice
SO RICE
AB Background Chloroplasts are essential for photosynthesis and play key roles in plant development. High temperature affects structure of chloroplasts and metabolism in plants. The seryl-tRNA synthetase plays an important role in translation of proteins. Although seryl-tRNA synthetase has been widely studied in microbes and animals, few studies have reported about its role in chloroplast development under high temperature in rice. Results In this study, we isolated a noveltemperature-sensitive chlorophyll-deficient 11(tscd11) mutant by ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis ofjaponicavariety Wuyujing7. Thetscd11mutant developed albino leaves at the 3-leaf stage under high temperature (35 degrees C), but had normal green leaves under low temperature (25 degrees C). Consistent with the albino phenotype, impaired chloroplasts, decreased chlorophyll content and increased ROS accumulation were found in thetscd11mutant at 35 degrees C. Fine mapping and DNA sequencing oftscd11revealed a missense mutation (G to A) in the eighth exon ofLOC_Os11g39670resulted in amino acid change (Glu(374)to Lys(374)). TheTSCD11gene encodes a seryl-tRNA synthetase localized to chloroplast. Complementation test confirmed that the point mutation inTSCD11is responsible for the phenotype oftscd11.TSCD11is highly expressed in leaves. Compared with the wild type (WT), mutation inTSCD11led to significant alteration in expression levels of genes associated with chlorophyll biosynthesis, photosynthesis and chloroplast development under high temperature. Conclusions TSCD11, encoding a seryl-tRNA synthetase localized to chloroplast, is vital to early chloroplast development at high temperature in rice, which help to further study on the molecular mechanism of chloroplast development under high temperature.

TI A Crosstalk Between Dual-Specific Phosphatases and Dual-Specific Protein
   Kinases Can Be A Potential Therapeutic Target for Anti-cancer Therapy
SO PROTEIN KINASE-MEDIATED DECISIONS BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH
SE Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology
AB While protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) play an initiative role in growth factor-mediated cellular processes, protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) negatively regulates these processes, acting as tumor suppressors. Besides selective tyrosine dephosphorylation of PTKs via PTPs may affect oncogenic pathways during carcinogenesis. The PTP family contains a group of dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) that regulate the activity of Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which are key effectors in the control of cell growth, proliferation and survival. Abnormal MAPK signaling is critical for initiation and progression stages of carcinogenesis. Since depletion of DUSP-MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) can reduce tumorigenicity, altering MAPK signaling by DUSP-MKP inhibitors could be a novel strategy in anti-cancer therapy. Moreover, Cdc25A is, a DUSP and a key regulator of the cell cycle, promotes cell cycle progression by dephosphorylating and activating cyclin--dependent kinases (CDK). Cdc25A-CDK pathway is a novel mechanism in carcinogenesis. Besides the mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR) kinase inhibitors or mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 ( mTORC1) inhibition in combination with the dual phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/mTOR or AKT kinase inhibitors are more effective in inhibiting the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) and cap- dependent translation. Dual targeting of the Akt and mTOR signaling pathways regulates cellular growth, proliferation and survival. Like the Cdc2-like kinases (CLK), dual-specific tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinases (DYRKs) are essential for the regulation of cell fate. The crosstalk between dual-specific phosphatases and dual-specific protein kinases is a novel drug target for anti-cancer therapy. Therefore, the focus of this chapter involves protein kinase modules, critical biochemical checkpoints of cancer therapy and the synergistic effects of protein kinases and anti-cancer molecules.

TI Plant Stress Granules: Trends and Beyond
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB Stress granules (SGs) are dynamic membrane-less condensates transiently assembled through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in response to stress. SGs display a biphasic architecture constituted of core and shell phases. The core is a conserved SG fraction fundamental for its assembly and consists primarily of proteins with intrinsically disordered regions and RNA-binding domains, along with translational-related proteins. The shell fraction contains specific SG components that differ among species, cell type, and developmental stage and might include metabolic enzymes, receptors, transcription factors, untranslated mRNAs, and small molecules. SGs assembly positively correlates with stalled translation associated with stress responses playing a pivotal role during the adaptive cellular response, post-stress recovery, signaling, and metabolic rewire. After stress, SG disassembly releases mRNA and proteins to the cytoplasm to reactivate translation and reassume cell growth and development. However, under severe stress conditions or aberrant cellular behavior, SG dynamics are severely disturbed, affecting cellular homeostasis and leading to cell death in the most critical cases. The majority of research on SGs has focused on yeast and mammals as model organism. Nevertheless, the study of plant SGs has attracted attention in the last few years. Genetics studies and adapted techniques from other non-plant models, such as affinity capture coupled with multi-omics analyses, have enriched our understanding of SG composition in plants. Despite these efforts, the investigation of plant SGs is still an emerging field in plant biology research. In this review, we compile and discuss the accumulated progress of plant SGs regarding their composition, organization, dynamics, regulation, and their relation to other cytoplasmic foci. Lastly, we will explore the possible connections among the most exciting findings of SGs from mammalian, yeast, and plants, which might help provide a complete view of the biology of plant SGs in the future.

TI Simulating upstream flame propagation in a narrow channel after wall
   preheating: Flame analysis and chemistry reduction strategy
SO COMBUSTION AND FLAME
AB The response of a premixed laminar flame, stabilised in a narrow channel (l(i) = 5 mm), is investigated for an amount of heat supplied upstream through the wall. The first objective is to determine the set of canonical problems that a reduced chemistry must accurately reproduce to simulate the flame/wall coupling under such circumstances. The second objective is to identify the major energy transport mechanisms at play, i.e. convective heat transfer in the gas or conductive in the solid wall. The stoichiometric methane-air flame numerical simulations performed include complex molecular transport and the fully coupled solving of heat transfer at and within the wall. Initially, the flame is stabilised by an inlet mass flow rate matching the flame burning velocity. A reference simulation is first performed with a comprehensive methane-air chemistry. Then, two chemistry reduction strategies targeting a different set of canonical problems are applied and the results compared to conclude on the necessary constraints for chemistry reduction under such flow configuration. Various heating intensities are considered and a minimum heating supply is found necessary to initiate a complete upstream flame translation. A specific attention is paid on the relative contributions of heat convection in the flow and heat conduction in the solid. The heat transfer mechanism triggering the flame movement is revealed to be mainly convective. The flame translation is found to be organised in two stages, with first a downstream movement due to fresh gases expansion because of heating by the wall, followed by the upstream propagation due to the enhancement of the burning rate by the preheating of the mixture. The shape, the flash back speed, and the final position of the flame vary with the amplitude of the heat flux brought to the external surface of the wall. (C) 2018 The Combustion Institute.

TI TaEF1A is involved in low phosphorus stress responses and affects root
   development
SO PLANT GROWTH REGULATION
AB Translation elongation factors (EF) play essential roles in intracellular protein synthesis and are often used as housekeeping genes in expression studies due to their relatively steady levels, and some EF genes have also been found to participate in the stress response. At present, little information regarding stress-related EF genes is available in nutrient-induced signal transduction. Here, in order to better explore the molecular function of EF gene in response to nutrient stress, we isolated a translation elongation factor gene from the wheat cultivar 'Zhengmai9023', which was named TaEF1A, and its structural characteristics and sequence conservation among related species were analyzed. TaEF1A expression is rapidly induced by low phosphate (LP) stress at the early stage in wheat. Moreover, to further elucidate the function of the TaEF1 gene in the low phosphate (LP) stress response, we generated TaEF1A-overexpressing transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants and found that the number of lateral roots in TaEF1A-overexpressing transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana was significantly increased compared with that in wild-type plants under LP stress. Meanwhile, observations using a mCherry antibody combined with laser confocal microscopy revealed that the TaEF1A protein was distributed near the membranes of root tip cells. More importantly, analysis of the transcription level showed that the expression of the key gene auxin response factor (ARF7), which is a critical factor for lateral root primordial development, was significantly up-regulated, indicating that the TaEF1A gene might promote lateral root development by regulating the ARF gene. Taken together, our results suggest that the TaEF1A gene is involved in the response to phosphorus stress and affects lateral root development, providing new clues into the regulation of the plant response under LP and the molecular mechanism underlying the role of the wheat EF gene in the stress response.

TI THE ANCIENT MOTIFS IN THE POETRY OF BOLES?AW TABORSKI
SO PAMIETNIK LITERACKI
AB Antique themes, which, as can be seen from the above review, occupied a certain place in the poetry of Boleslaw Taborski, appeared in several quite distinctly different genre forms. First of all, we find in his collections of poems original works inspired by a certain Greek myth (e.g. the myth of the Argonauts, the myth of Sisyphus, or the myth of Ganymede). Another thematic category includes poems referring to a specific historical event (e.g. the burning of the Artemision in Ephesus by Herostrates, or Caesar crossing the Rubicon river). Further variety of genre in Taborski's poetry collections are poetic "reviews" of Greek tragedies staged on contemporary stages, such as Euripides' Trojans and Electra or Sophocles' Antigone. One more variety are poetic records of the author's reflections and thoughts on modern plays and operas with ancient themes, such as Shakespeare's Troilus and Cressida or Antony and Cleopatra, Monteverdi's L'Orfeo or Purcell's Dido and Aeneas. Finally, there are the translations of poems by Roman poets Catullus and Propertius, and Anglo-Saxon poets. Generally speaking, quite numerous references to antiquity in Taborski's poetry prove that it was one of the most important sources of inspiration for him and that antiquity, its myth, history, literature were living elements of contemporary culture. An- tique themes in Taborski's poetry serve not only to discover the truth about reality, to reveal its hidden layers, but also to uncover history, to show its dramatic limitations of Taborski's struggle with history.

TI m ( 6 ) Aexpress-BHM: predicting m(6)A regulation of gene expression in
   multiple-groups context by a Bayesian hierarchical mixture model
SO BRIEFINGS IN BIOINFORMATICS
AB As the most abundant RNA modification, N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) plays an important role in various RNA activities including gene expression and translation. With the rapid application of MeRIP-seq technology, samples of multiple groups, such as the involved multiple viral/ bacterial infection or distinct cell differentiation stages, are extracted from same experimental unit. However, our current knowledge about how the dynamic m(6)A regulating gene expression and the role in certain biological processes (e.g. immune response in this complex context) is largely elusive due to lack of effective tools. To address this issue, we proposed a Bayesian hierarchical mixture model (called m(6)Aexpress-BHM) to predict m(6)A regulation of gene expression (m(6)A-reg-exp) in multiple groups of MeRIP-seq experiment with limited samples. Comprehensive evaluations of m(6)Aexpress-BHM on the simulated data demonstrate its high predicting precision and robustness. Applying m(6)Aexpress-BHM on three real-world datasets (i.e. Flaviviridae infection, infected time-points of bacteria and differentiation stages of dendritic cells), we predicted more m(6)A-reg-exp genes with positive regulatory mode that significantly participate in innate immune or adaptive immune pathways, revealing the underlying mechanism of the regulatory function of m(6)A during immune response. In addition, we also found that m(6)A may influence the expression of PD-1/PD-L1 via regulating its interacted genes. These results demonstrate the power of m(6)Aexpress-BHM, helping us understand the m(6)A regulatory function in immune system.

TI Philosophy from the Bottom Up: Eknath's Vernacular Advaita
SO JOURNAL OF INDIAN PHILOSOPHY
AB The sixteenth-century Marathi poet-saint Eknath is better known for his devotional songs (abhang) and allegorical drama-poems (bharud) than his "philosophical" writings. These writings include commentaries on and distillations of Sanskrit texts that feature a highly localized form of Advaita, or non-dualist Vedanta. Rather than consider them vernacular translations of the classical traditions of Advaita, I propose to read Eknath's philosophical works as embedded in a local context of non-dualist thought that filtered into the elite world of Sanskrit knowledge-systems. I provide examples from his Marathi commentary on the Sanskrit Hastamalaka Stotra, a brief versified teaching on Advaita Vedanta. I also look at the para-textual material bracketing the content and some of the accompanying manuscript record, in order to understand the context for circulation and transmission of this material among Eknath's various readers over generations. My general attempt is to understand how ideas and practices belonging to local, vernacular networks filter into elite Sanskrit systems of knowledge-that is, not just into flexible genres like pura?a but into disciplines, like Vedanta, that are generally viewed as impervious to the world around them. From my perspective, all knowledge is local, even that articulated in such cosmopolitan languages as Sanskrit. In Eknath's vernacular Advaita, we find evidence for a much wider scope for the movement of ideas, one that moves not from top-down but bottom-up.

TI Dynamic Expression and Regulatory Network of Circular RNA for Abdominal
   Preadipocytes Differentiation in Chicken (Gallus gallus)
SO FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB Circular RNA (circRNA), as a novel endogenous biomolecule, has been emergingly demonstrated to play crucial roles in mammalian lipid metabolism and obesity. However, little is known about their genome-wide identification, expression profile, and function in chicken adipogenesis. In present study, the adipogenic differentiation of chicken abdominal preadipocyte was successfully induced, and the regulatory functional circRNAs in chicken adipogenesis were identified from abdominal adipocytes at different differentiation stages using Ribo-Zero RNA-seq. A total of 1,068 circRNA candidates were identified and mostly derived from exons. Of these, 111 differentially expressed circRNAs (DE-circRNAs) were detected, characterized by stage-specific expression, and enriched in several lipid-related pathways, such as Hippo signaling pathway, mTOR signaling pathway. Through weighted gene co-expression network analyses (WGCNA) and K-means clustering analyses, two DE-circRNAs, Z:35565770|35568133 and Z:54674624|54755962, were identified as candidate regulatory circRNAs in chicken adipogenic differentiation. Z:35565770|35568133 might compete splicing with its parental gene, ABHD17B, owing to its strictly negative co-expression. We also constructed competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network based on DE-circRNA, DE-miRNA, DE-mRNAs, revealing that Z:54674624|54755962 might function as a ceRNA to regulate chicken adipogenic differentiation through the gga-miR-1635-AHR2/IRF1/MGAT3/ABCA1/AADAC and/or the novel_miR_232-STAT5A axis. Translation activity analysis showed that Z:35565770|35568133 and Z:54674624|54755962 have no protein-coding potential. These findings provide valuable evidence for a better understanding of the specific functions and molecular mechanisms of circRNAs underlying avian adipogenesis.

TI Molecular insights into plant desiccation tolerance: transcriptomics,
   proteomics and targeted metabolite profiling in Craterostigma
   plantagineum
SO PLANT JOURNAL
AB The resurrection plant Craterostigma plantagineum possesses an extraordinary capacity to survive long-term desiccation. To enhance our understanding of this phenomenon, complementary transcriptome, soluble proteome and targeted metabolite profiling was carried out on leaves collected from different stages during a dehydration and rehydration cycle. A total of 7348 contigs, 611 proteins and 39 metabolites were differentially abundant across the different sampling points. Dynamic changes in transcript, protein and metabolite levels revealed a unique signature characterizing each stage. An overall low correlation between transcript and protein abundance suggests a prominent role for post-transcriptional modification in metabolic reprogramming to prepare plants for desiccation and recovery. The integrative analysis of all three data sets was performed with an emphasis on photosynthesis, photorespiration, energy metabolism and amino acid metabolism. The results revealed a set of precise changes that modulate primary metabolism to confer plasticity to metabolic pathways, thus optimizing plant performance under stress. The maintenance of cyclic electron flow and photorespiration, and the switch from C-3 to crassulacean acid metabolism photosynthesis, may contribute to partially sustain photosynthesis and minimize oxidative damage during dehydration. Transcripts with a delayed translation, ATP-independent bypasses, alternative respiratory pathway and 4-aminobutyric acid shunt may all play a role in energy management, together conferring bioenergetic advantages to meet energy demands upon rehydration. This study provides a high-resolution map of the changes occurring in primary metabolism during dehydration and rehydration and enriches our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning plant desiccation tolerance. The data sets provided here will ultimately inspire biotechnological strategies for drought tolerance improvement in crops.

TI Cu-64(2+) Ions as PET Probe: An Emerging Paradigm in Molecular Imaging
   of Cancer
SO MOLECULAR PHARMACEUTICS
AB Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has transformed diagnostic nuclear medicine and become an essential strategy in cancer management. With the expected growth of this molecular imaging modality, there is a recognized need for new PET probes to address the clinical challenges in the early diagnosis and staging of various types of cancers. In this endeavor, the prospect of using Cu-64 in the form of simple Cu2+ ions as PET probe is not only a cost-effective proposition but also seems poised to broaden the palette of molecular imaging probes in the foreseeable future. The usefulness of Cu-64(2+) ions as PET probe is based on the fact that Cu is an essential element that plays an important role in cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Over the past few years, there has been continuous flow of evidences based on studies in animal models on the uptake of Cu-64(2+) ions in different types of tumors, including, hepatoma, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, head and neck cancer, fibrosarcoma, melanoma, glioblastoma, and ovarian cancer. The widespread preclinical success of Cu-64(2+) ions as PET probe has recently resulted in translation of this radiotracer to clinical settings for noninvasive imaging and staging of prostate cancer in human patients. In this concise review, we have focused on the latest developments in PET imaging of cancer in preclinical and clinical settings using Cu-64(2+) ion as a probe and discussed the challenges and opportunities for future development.

TI RETRACTED: miR-494 promotes cell proliferation, migration and invasion,
   and increased sorafenib resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma by
   targeting PTEN (Retracted article. See vol. 47, 2022)
SO ONCOLOGY REPORTS
AB MicroRNA-494 (miR-494) acts as an oncomiR and is involved in tumor development, progression and metastasis, and confers resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs by targeting a number of molecules in several human cancers. However, the function and underlying molecular mechanism of miR-494 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been totally elucidated. In the present study, we determined the role played by miR-494 in HCC tissues and HCC cell lines using quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). The results showed that, miR-494 was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues and HCC cell lines. Additionally, a high miR-494 expression positively correlated with tumor differentiation (P<0.01), TNM stage (P<0.01) and lymph node metastasis (P<0.01). Luciferase reporter assays confirmed that miR-494 binds to the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) mRNA and represses its translation. Functional analyses indicated that the upregulation of miR-494 promoted cell viability, migration and invasion, decreased cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G1 stage, and conferred sorafenib resistance to HCC cell lines. Underexpression of PTEN by siRNA significantly attenuated the inhibitory effects of anti-miR-494 on the proliferation, migration and invasion of liver cancer cells. Mechanistic investigations revealed that miR-494 suppressed the expression of PTEN but increased the expression of PI3K and p-Akt, which contribute to the promotion of proliferation, migration and invasion, and increased sorafenib resistance to HCC cell lines. These findings suggested that miR-494 is a potential candidate for HCC therapeutics.

TI Health governance by collaboration: a case study on an area-based
   programme to tackle health inequalities in the Dutch city of the Hague
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Background: Area-based programmes are seen as a promising strategy for tackling health inequalities. In these programmes, local authorities and other local actors collaborate to employ health promoting interventions and policies. Little is known about the underlying processes of collaborative governance. To unravel this black box, we explored how the authority of The Hague, The Netherlands, developed a programme tackling health inequalities drawing on a collaborative mode of governance. Methods: Case study drawing on qualitative semi-structured interviews and document review. Data were inductively analysed against the concept of collaborative governance. Results: The authority's ambition was to co-produce a programme on tackling health inequalities with local actors. Three stages could be distinguished in the governing process: (i) formulating policy objectives, (ii) translating policy objectives into interventions and (iii) executing health interventions. In the stage of formulating policy objectives, the collaboration led to a reframing of the initial objectives. Furthermore, the translation of the policy objectives into health interventions was rather pragmatic and loosely based on health needs and/or evidence. As a result, the concrete actions that ensued from the programme did not necessarily reflect the initial objectives. Conclusion: In a local system of health governance by collaboration, factors other than the stated policy objectives played a role, eventually undermining the effectiveness of the programme in reducing health inequalities. To be effective, the processes of collaborative governance underlying area-based programmes require the attention of the local authority, including the building and governing of networks, a competent public health workforce and supportive infrastructures.

TI Isolation and characterization of a wheat IF2 homolog required for
   innate immunity to stripe rust
SO PLANT CELL REPORTS
AB The wheat eIF2 homolog, TaIF2, is induced by the stripe rust pathogen CYR 32 at an early stage of inoculation and is related to the innate immunity resistance level in wheat.
   The initiation of translation represents a critical control point in the regulation of gene expression in all organisms. We previously identified an upregulated EST S186 (EL773056) from an SSH-cDNA library of the Shaanmai 139 strain of wheat (Triticum aestivum) infected with Puccinia striiformis (Pst). In the present work, we isolated a cDNA clone and identified it as a wheat IF2 homolog. This cDNA consisted of 1,314 nucleotides and contained an open reading frame of 795 nucleotides encoding a polypeptide of 254 amino acids. The amino acids represent a conserved domain in EF-Tu, mtIF2-II, and mtIF2-Ivc. The alignment result showed that it maybe a partial cDNA of the initiation factor 2/eukaryotic initiation factor 5B (IF2/eIF5B) superfamily gene. Paradoxically, results of a Swiss-model analysis suggesting a low QMEAN Z-score implied that it was a membrane protein. Quantitative RT-PCR studies confirmed that the wheat eIF2 (TaIF2) homolog was differentially expressed in three near-isogenic lines. Critical time points for the induction of resistance by inoculation with Pst CYR32 in YrSM139-1B + YrSM139-2D immune resistance genotype occurred at 1 and 3 dpi (days post-infection). RNAi test showed that the inoculated BSMV-IF2 leaves of Shaanmai 139 showed obvious cell death after 15 days of inoculation with CYR 32. qRT-PCR analysis of the target gene in cDNA samples isolated from BSMV-IF2-Pst, BSMV-0-Pst and Pst infected leaves confirmed that the expression of TaIF2 is suppressed by BSMV-IF2 at 3 dpi. This suggested that TaIF2/eIF5B plays an important role in the mechanism of innate immunity to stripe rust pathogen.

TI "I feel I am like Matilda": a study on Taiwanese adolescent readers'
   transmediational practices from reading Roald Dahl's Matilda
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE AND LITERACY
AB Suhor (Journal of Curriculum Studies 16. 247-257, 1984) defines transmediation as the "translation of content from one sign system to another" (p. 250). Research has shown that encouraging learners to transmediate meanings across modes provides them with opportunities to represent meanings in multiple ways. In fact, Fueyo (Counterpoints 176, 21-34, 2002) stated that thinking and expressing oneself through a range of sign systems is a basic educational right in a democratic society. The current study continues the research on transmediation by investigating how a class of Taiwanese English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) adolescent students translated the textual content of Roald Dahl's (1988) classic novel Matilda into non-textual modes (e.g., drawings and drama skits). The participants engaged in a two-stage transmediational process by first drawing an individual illustration to accompany a passage taken from the novel and then working in groups to represent their favorite chapters in a multimodal manner. Results indicated various degrees of transferring and transforming the original textual content. It was also found that allowing students to choose the content to focus on for their final transmediational projects did not motivate students to transform their knowledge of the novel to a greater degree, as most of them were more concerned with accurately presenting the textual content. This article concludes with teaching suggestions and research directions to encourage practitioners and researchers to look further into the uses of transmediational practices in literacy instruction and research.

TI The Celestial's Position, or Over Barriers. Boris Pasternak and Fyodor
   Stepun
SO RUSSIAN STUDIES IN PHILOSOPHY
AB In this article, the author examines the work of Boris Pasternak, primarily his novel Doctor Zhivago, in the context of his Marburg experience and Kantian ideas as the basis of his moral-aesthetic position. Pasternak tried to live and write over the barriers that a totalitarian era had erected in human life. His late novel managed to tell Russia and the rest of humanity about this tragic century in Russian history, using as the basis of his reflections a Russian intellectual who grew up on the pathos of a Christianity rethought in early twentieth-century Russia. What happened in Russia in 1917 was not only a social pogrom, but also an intellectual one. Pasternak's novel was a unique attempt to cope with this intellectual catastrophe by relying on Christianity. The very name of the protagonist, Zhivago, has a rhyme in the Gospels. It was not by chance that Pasternak shared with the Christian thinker Fyodor Stepun that he had written about Doctor Zhivago while working on a translation of Goethe's Faust, that great mystery-drama. He recounted Russia's historical tragedy through the fate of a single man, a doctor and poet. Pasternak won the battle against the darkness that had engulfed his homeland, preserving a soul capable of grieving for loved ones despite restrictive barriers, for the starry heavens above and the moral law within made the core of his personhood.

TI Bacterial communities in soils as indicators of the potential of syenite
   as an agromineral
SO PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
AB The objective of this work was to identify microbial communities associated with the surfaces of alkali feldspars and to determine whether these microbes might be involved in the weathering of these rocks for agronomic benefit. Samples were taken from weathering profiles and soils developed on a syenite, considered as a raw material for agromineral production, located in the municipality of Triunfo, in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. Molecular microbiological techniques (qPCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing) were used, and data were interpreted by the analysis of variance, hierarchical cluster analysis, and principal coordinates analysis. In addition, scanning electron microscopy was used to image mineral surfaces. Similar bacterial communities were observed in all samples, showing that the bacteria found in soil are present at the earliest stages of rock weathering and are available to play a role in nutrient release. In particular, Actinobacteria and, within this phylum, Actinomycetales were proportionally more abundant than other taxa in rock-dominated soil samples, i.e., in thin soils on or between fractured or broken syenite. The analysis of rock dust used as a remineralizer, crushed with no further treatment, shows that Actinobacteria play a role in the early stages of weathering of feldspar-bearing rocks.

TI Dynamics of Known Long Non-Coding RNAs during the Maternal-to-Zygotic
   Transition in Rabbit
SO ANIMALS
AB Simple Summary We first revealed the expression profile of rabbit known lncRNAs during embryo pre-implantation development and showed minor and major wave of zygotic lncRNAs synthesis. The study then selected the differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs between consecutive stages and predicted their potential target genes. The GO and KEGG analyses suggested that the lncRNAs participate in the regulation of embryo cleavage and development. Additionally, the sequential degradation of maternal lncRNAs showed that, like maternal mRNAs, maternal lncRNAs degradation occurred via maternal and zygotic pathways and the late-degraded lncRNAs might play a role in the degradation of mRNAs through mRNA surveillance pathway. The control of pre-implantation development in mammals undergoes a maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) after fertilization. The transition involves maternal clearance and zygotic genome activation remodeling the terminal differentiated gamete to confer totipotency. In the study, we first determined the profile of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) of mature rabbit oocyte, 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, and morula embryos using RNA-seq. A total of 2673 known rabbit lncRNAs were identified. The lncRNAs exhibited dynamic expression patterns during pre-implantation development. Moreover, 107 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DE lncRNAs) were detected between mature oocyte and 2-cell embryo, while 419 DE lncRNAs were detected between 8-cell embryo and morula, consistent with the occurrence of minor and major zygotic genome activation (ZGA) wave of rabbit pre-implanted embryo. This study then predicted the potential target genes of DE lncRNAs based on the trans-regulation mechanism of lncRNAs. The GO and KEGG analyses showed that lncRNAs with stage-specific expression patterns promoted embryo cleavage and synchronic development by regulating gene transcription and translation, intracellular metabolism and organelle organization, and intercellular signaling transduction. The correlation analysis between mRNAs and lncRNAs identified that lncRNAs ENSOCUG00000034943 and ENSOCUG00000036338 may play a vital role in the late-period pre-implantation development by regulating ILF2 gene. This study also found that the sequential degradation of maternal lncRNAs occurred through maternal and zygotic pathways. Furthermore, the function analysis of the late-degraded lncRNAs suggested that these lncRNAs may play a role in the mRNA degradation in embryos via mRNA surveillance pathway. Therefore, this work provides a global view of known lncRNAs in rabbit pre-implantation development and highlights the role of lncRNAs in embryogenesis regulation.

TI DANTE?S PLOT ON FRANCESCO AND PAOLO IN SPANISH LITERATURE OF THE
   15(th)-17(th) CENTURIES
SO STUDIA LITTERARUM
AB The article discusses the reception of the Divine Comedy (La Divina Commedia) by Dante Alighieri and, in particular, of Canto 5 of the Inferno and its central episode - Dante's encounter with Francesca and Paolo, in Spanish literature of the 15th-17th centuries. It began at the end of the initial third of the 15th century that was caused by late reception of the European courtesy tradition in Spain. Old translations of Infierno by Dante (Enrique de Villena, Pedro Fernandez de Villegas) saw in the story of Francesca and Paolo first and foremost a cautionary example of the tragic effect of the courteous poetry and its ideals on real fates of people, thus partly determining further ways of perception of the narrative of killed lovers and its effect on the Spanish poetry and drama. The brightest expression of this idea is the episode, where Marquess de Santillana, hero of El Triumphete de Amor vision, meets the Dante's characters and the "dona de Ravenna" gives place to Galician troubadour Macias. The national legend and didactic representation of Dante's episode forced the narrative of Francesca and Paolo out of the Spanish literature. Lope de Vega's play titled El castigo sin venganza written on the basis of the plot of Bandello's novella and transformed under the influence of Dante's episode became in a way the return to the initial and tragic essence of the story of two lovers.

CY NOV, 2006
CL Lancaster Univ, Lancaster, ENGLAND
HO Lancaster Univ
AB This article investigates the 'glocalization' of the US TV popular drama series The West Wing, while focusing on one (in some ways) exceptional episode. Because politics is inherently linked to language, discourse and communication, I will take an approach from the perspective of critical discourse analysis (the discourse-historical approach), with a particular focus on elements of argumentation theory and rhetoric, and combine this with media studies. More specifically, I attempt to illustrate how a thorough understanding of the topoi operating within the complex dialogues and interactions helps to reveal the series' (manifest and latent) political and didactic objectives, embedded in a longstanding tradition of conveying US American liberal values via films and TV. The episode analyzed in this article, Isaac and Ishmael (which was broadcast immediately after 9/11) is exceptional because it explicitly relates to salient real life events; its topical focus on the 'war on terror' shifts attention from US domestic politics to an issue that, according to US policy rhetoric, concerns the whole world. Thus, this episode links the debates taking place in one of the world's most famous institutions, The White House, with those occurring in workplaces across the world: a truly 'g/local' moment. The interdisciplinary analysis allows insight into the intricate and complex discursive construction of new glocal narratives, particularly in times of political crisis, revealing which norms are projected and recontextualized both locally and globally, given the many translations of the series worldwide.

AB This paper examines not only on the socio-economic implication of the lockdown on practitioners in the entertainment industry namely the cinema halls, live performances, and the film industries among others, but also it explores the ways E-entertainment was being introduced especially in music and drama industry. With the lockdown orchestrated by the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak in Nigeria, show lovers were being entertained through E-concerts, drive in theatre performances, and television live shows like Owambe and Pepsi Dance Party that was being showed every weekend with the audience responding on face book, Instagram and WhatsApp platforms among others. The research method is qualitative and analytical. The study employed a survey method of data collection to gather relevant material from published and unpublished materials in hard and soft copies which included online materials. The material was analyzed through mixed-method, which involved description, explanation, translation, and interpretation. The result showed that the COVID-19 pandemic impacted negatively the entertainment industry, bringing to a halt the performer/audience physical participation and interaction and a lot of reduction in the socio-economic progress of entertainers and the entertainment industry depends on their audience for finance. It also opened up the need for the entertainment industry to focus more on the acquisition of E-entertainment facilities to bridge the gap between the entertainers and the audiences on a larger scale to take care of pandemic incidents like COVID-19.

TI Christ's Passion, Christian tragedy and Ioannes Franciscus Quintianus
   Stoa's untimely Theoandrothanatos
SO RENAISSANCE STUDIES
AB Ioannes Franciscus Quintianus Stoa's Theoandrothanatos (1508) is perhaps the first work in early modernity to depict Christ's Passion as a tragedy. Despite its claims to originality, however, Theoandrothanatos rarely appears as more than a curio in critical studies of Renaissance drama or theology. When it is considered at more length, both the tragedy and poet himself are generally derided as effete and uninspired, an enduring critical inclination that obscures Quintianus Stoa's importance in the early sixteenth century as well as the scope of his tragic experiment. Placing Quintianus Stoa's Latin tragedy in conversation with theological interlocutors and classical influences, this essay examines the affective vision of tragedy at work in Theoandrothanatos, a version of tragedy which stands at odds with the humanist textual tradition emerging at the outset of the sixteenth century. Although he shares an interest in antique tragedy with those humanists, Quintianus Stoa endorses an approach to tragedy that quickly falls out of fashion, particularly once sophisticated editions, translations, and textual studies of antique tragedies became widely available. Moreover, an emergent tradition of Christian tragedy defined itself in opposition to Theoandrothanatos particularly Nicolas Barthelemy de Loches's Christus Xilonicus (1529), which was more representative of the aims of tragedy as well as its Christian appropriations. This essay thus examines Quintianus Stoa's determination of tragedy before demonstrating both how and why this vision, initially celebrated, fell into disgrace and abeyance.

TI A Dictionary in the Archives: Translating and transcribing silenced
   histories in French and Wendat
SO PERFORMANCE RESEARCH
AB 'A Dictionary in the Archives' investigates First Nations and French transcriptions of Indigenous languages through the Chaumonot manuscript held at Brown University's John Carter Brown Library. This approach responds to diffuse narrative arcs regarding colonization that, through the writing of Carlos Ulises Deceno, I term 'tacit historiography.' In light of the move to revive North American languages repressed in the course of colonization, I address recently authored histories of North-Eastern and North-Central North Americahere, modern day Ontario, Oklahoma, Quebec and Michiganalongside the path-setting work of Wendat First Nations linguist Megan Lukaniec, poet, scholar and historian Georges E. Sioui and teacher and translator John Steckley. Reviving what Lukaniec calls the 'slumbering' language of Wendat/Wyandotte, a language Euro-American scholars previously described as 'extinct,' involves drawing from seventeenth-century French translations and transcriptions in archives in order to return the language to everyday use. This reflection on the Chaumonot manuscript, as well as Gabriel Sagard's 1632 phrasebook of French and 'Huron,' attends to codexes' materiality as well as to the social and embodied movements of reading's structural and scriptive codes. I investigate performatives and performance structures in the texts, theorizing 'trans-scriptive things' in the archives to address translation/transcription in cross-cultural, cross-linguistic and cross-temporal contexts. This work investigates Robin Bernstein's study of the 'scriptive thing' in Racial Innocence (2011) as well as Mel Chen's conceptual and linguistic 'ontologizing' structures (2012). Here, trans/performance traces the force of movements across and between languages as well as between spoken and written systems of memory, including the impact of translations on nonbinary gender and matrilineal authority.

TI Audio description in the theater: Assessment of satisfaction and quality
   of the experience among individuals with visual impairment
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF VISUAL IMPAIRMENT
AB Purpose: Audio description (AD) is the systematic method of describing images and visual events to people who are blind or visually impaired (B/VI). AD facilitates access to cultural events such as movies, theater, and professional conferences, and it is aimed at enhancing the partaker's experience. The current study investigates the impact of AD on the quality of the theater experience during the initial stages of implementation of AD service in theaters in Israel. Specifically, the study analyzes the satisfaction of B/VI theater patrons from AD service as well as the quality of the AD theater experience in relation to the complete three-pronged "AD package": auditory narration, a touch tour, and preshow notes. Methods: In all, 83 legally B/VI participants were recruited through social networks. Mean age 54 (+/- 14); 58% women. Quantitative questionnaires were developed to assess the satisfaction, quality of the experience, and aspects of accessibility. Five theater productions were available with and without AD. Each participant attended two different plays, one which was audio described and one which was not. Half of the participants saw the AD play first and half saw the non-AD play first. Results: 87% of the participants reported high overall satisfaction from the AD narration service. In addition, high satisfaction was reported concerning the AD device (67%), pre-show notes (85%), and touch tour (77%). A comparison of the quality of the experience between plays with AD versus without revealed a significantly enhanced experience (p < .001) when the play was audio described. In addition, several general accessibility issues were identified that impede participation. Conclusion: AD is an important service that should be used widely to enhance the engagement of B/VI individuals in cultural events. Furthermore, it is imperative that AD be provided alongside comprehensive accessibility considerations.

TI Analysis of m6A RNA Methylation-Related Genes in Liver Hepatocellular
   Carcinoma and Their Correlation with Survival
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification on RNA plays an important role in tumorigenesis and metastasis, which could change gene expression and even function at multiple levels such as RNA splicing, stability, translocation, and translation. In this study, we aim to conduct a comprehensive analysis on m6A RNA methylation-related genes, including m6A RNA methylation regulators and m6A RNA methylation-modified genes, in liver hepatocellular carcinoma, and their relationship with survival and clinical features. Data, which consist of the expression of widely reported m6A RNA methylation-related genes in liver hepatocellular carcinoma from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), were analyzed by one-way ANOVA, Univariate Cox regression, a protein-protein interaction network, gene enrichment analysis, feature screening, a risk prognostic model, correlation analysis, and consensus clustering analysis. In total, 405 of the m6A RNA methylation-related genes were found based on one-way ANOVA. Among them, DNA topoisomerase 2-alpha (TOP2A), exodeoxyribonuclease 1 (EXO1), ser-ine/threonine-protein kinase Nek2 (NEK2), baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 5 (BIRC5), hyaluronan mediated motility receptor (HMMR), structural maintenance of chromosomes protein 4 (SMC4), bloom syndrome protein (BLM), ca-sein kinase I isoform epsilon (CSNK1E), cytoskeleton-associated protein 5 (CKAP5), and inner centromere protein (INCENP), which were m6A RNA methylation-modified genes, were recognized as the hub genes based on the protein-protein interaction analysis. The risk prognostic model showed that gender, AJCC stage, grade, T, and N were significantly different between the subgroup with the high and low risk groups. The AUC, the evaluation parameter of the prediction model which was built by RandomForest, was 0.7. Furthermore, two subgroups were divided by consensus clustering analysis, in which stage, grade, and T differed. We identified the important genes expressed significantly among two clusters, including uridine-cytidine kinase 2 (UCK2), filensin (BFSP1), tubulin-specific chaperone D (TBCD), histone-lysine N-methyltransferase PRDM16 (PRDM16), phosphorylase b ki-nase regulatory subunit alpha (PHKA2), serine/threonine-protein kinase BRSK2 (BRSK2), Arf-GAP with coiled-coil (ACAP3), general transcription factor 3C polypep-tide 2 (GTF3C2), and guanine nucleotide exchange factor MSS4 (RABIF). In our study, the m6A RNA methylation-related genes in liver hepatocellular carcinoma were analyzed systematically, including the expression, interaction, function, and prognostic values, which provided an important theoretical basis for m6A RNA methylation in liver cancer. The nine important m6A-related genes could be prognostic markers in the survival time of patients.

TI Genome-Wide Investigation of N6-Methyladenosine Regulatory Genes and
   Their Roles in Tea (Camellia sinensis) Leaves During Withering Process
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB N6-methyladenosine (m6A), one of the internal modifications of RNA molecules, can directly influence RNA abundance and function without altering the nucleotide sequence, and plays a pivotal role in response to diverse environmental stresses. The precise m6A regulatory mechanism comprises three types of components, namely, m6A writers, erasers, and readers. To date, the research focusing on m6A regulatory genes in plant kingdom is still in its infancy. Here, a total of 34 m6A regulatory genes were identified from the chromosome-scale genome of tea plants. The expansion of m6A regulatory genes was driven mainly by whole-genome duplication (WGD) and segmental duplication, and the duplicated gene pairs evolved through purifying selection. Gene structure analysis revealed that the sequence variation contributed to the functional diversification of m6A regulatory genes. Expression pattern analysis showed that most m6A regulatory genes were differentially expressed under environmental stresses and tea-withering stage. These observations indicated that m6A regulatory genes play essential roles in response to environmental stresses and tea-withering stage. We also found that RNA methylation and DNA methylation formed a negative feedback by interacting with each other's methylation regulatory genes. This study provided a foundation for understanding the m6A-mediated regulatory mechanism in tea plants under environmental stresses and tea-withering stage.

TI Comparison of Gut Bacterial Communities of Locusta migratoria manilensis
   (Meyen) Reared on Different Food Plants
SO BIOLOGY-BASEL
AB Simple Summary Although locusts can cause major agricultural damage, they also constitute a valuable food resource. At present, L. migratoria manilensis has been largely domesticated, being considered an edible insect in China. Feeding variety is one of the main characteristics of L. migratoria manilensis. There are apparent differences in the capacity of locusts to adapt to different food plants. To elucidate the effect of different food plants (i.e., goosegrass, maize leaves, soybean leaves, and pakchoi) on the growth and development of L. migratoria manilensis, the gut bacterial community composition of L. migratoria manilensis fifth instars fed on different plants was analyzed by high-throughput sequencing. Gut bacterial communities were affected by food plants and may play an essential role in host adaption. Feeding on different food plants has significant effects on the growth and development of L. migratoria manilensis. The present study establishes a theoretical foundation for studying the interplay between gut bacteria structure and L. migratoria manilensis adaptation. Locusts, in particular Locusta migratoria manilensis (Meyen), have been associated with major damages in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry in China. At present, L. migratoria manilensis has been largely domesticated, being considered an edible insect in China. Feeding variety is one of the main characteristics of L. migratoria manilensis. It has been demonstrated that microorganisms inhabiting the insect gut impact nutrition, development, defense, and reproduction of the insect host. The aim of the present study was to search for the adaptation mechanism of L. migratoria manilensis feeding on four different food plants (goosegrass, maize leaves, soybean leaves, and pakchoi) and explore changes in the gut bacterial community structure of the insect at the fifth instar nymph stage. Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were the dominant phyla, whereas Kluyvera, Enterobacter, Pseudocitrobacter, Klebsiella, Cronobacter, Citrobacter, Lactococcus, and Weissella were the dominant genera in the gut of L. migratoria manilensis. Principal component analysis and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) revealed significant differences in the gut microbiota structure of L. migratoria manilensis fed on different food plants. Moreover, functional prediction analysis revealed that metabolic and cellular processes were the most enriched categories. Within the category of metabolic processes, the most enriched pathways were carbohydrate transport and metabolism; amino acid transport and metabolism; translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis; cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis; inorganic ion transport and metabolism; and energy production and conversion. Collectively, the present results revealed that the structure of gut bacterial communities in L. migratoria manilensis fed on different food plants is impacted by food plants, which may play an essential part in the adaptation of the host.

TI Pathways of cellular internalisation of liposomes delivered siRNA and
   effects on siRNA engagement with target mRNA and silencing in cancer
   cells
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Design of an efficient delivery system is a generally recognised bottleneck in translation of siRNA technology into clinic. Despite research efforts, cellular processes that determine efficiency of siRNA silencing achieved by different delivery formulations remain unclear. Here, we investigated the mechanism(s) of cellular internalisation of a model siRNA-loaded liposome system in a correlation to the engagement of delivered siRNA with its target and consequent silencing by adopting siRNA molecular beacon technology. Probing of cellular internalisation pathways by a panel of pharmacological inhibitors indicated that clathrin-mediated (dynamin-dependent) endocytosis, macropinocytosis (dynamine independent), and cell membrane cholesterol dependent process(es) (clathrin and caveolea-independent) all play a role in the siRNA-liposomes internalization. The inhibition of either of these entry routes was, in general, mirrored by a reduction in the level of siRNA engagement with its target mRNA, as well as in a reduction of the target gene silencing. A dramatic increase in siRNA engagement with its target RNA was observed on disruption of endosomal membrane (by chloroquine), accompanied with an increased silencing. The work thus illustrates that employing molecular beacon siRNA technology one can start to assess the target RNA engagement - a stage between initial cellular internalization and final gene silencing of siRNA delivery systems.

TI Acute liver failure-induced hepatic encephalopathy is associated with
   changes in microRNA expression profiles in cerebral cortex of the rat
SO METABOLIC BRAIN DISEASE
AB The mechanisms that promote brain dysfunction after acute liver failure (ALF) are not clearly understood. The small noncoding RNAs known as microRNAs (miRNAs) significantly control mRNA translation and thus normal and pathological functions in the mammalian body. To understand their significance in ALF, we currently profiled the expression of miRNAs in the cerebral cortex of mice sacrificed at coma stage following treatment with azoxymethane. Of the 470 miRNAs profiled using microarrays, 37 were significantly altered (20 up-and 17 down-regulated) in their expression in the ALF group compared to sham group. In silico analysis showed that the ALF-responsive miRNAs target on average 231 mRNAs/miRNA (range: 3 to 840 targets). Pathways analysis showed that many miRNAs altered after ALF target multiple mRNAs that are part of various biological and molecular pathways. Glutamatergic synapse, Wnt signaling, MAP-kinase signaling, axon guidance, PI3-kinase-AKT signaling, T-cell receptor signaling and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis are the top pathways targeted by the ALF-sensitive miRNAs. At least 28 ALF-responsive miRNAs target each of the above pathways. We hypothesize that alterations in miRNAs and their down-stream mRNAs of signaling pathways might play a role in the induction and progression of neurological dysfunction observed during ALF.

TI Reframing the climate debate: The origins and diffusion of net zero
   pledges
SO GLOBAL POLICY
AB Achieving net zero emissions has rapidly become the dominant long-term objective guiding national climate policies. At the end of 2018, only 24 countries were considering or had adopted long-term net zero targets. By the end of 2021, this had climbed to almost 150 countries, covering 89 per cent of global carbon emissions. In this article, we trace the origins and diffusion of net zero pledges through the lens of international norm theory. Drawing on a newly compiled database of national net zero targets, our analysis highlights the critical role played by climate scientists, transnational advocacy networks, and norm entrepreneurs in articulating the norm of net zero emissions. The IPCC's fifth assessment report was foundational, by introducing the concept of a cumulative carbon budget, allowing translation of abstract temperature goals into more actionable net zero targets. The norm of net zero has been institutionalised at the global political level in the period 2015-2018 and cascaded through the international system in 2019-2020. Yet, it remains subject to various forms of contestation, most notably regarding validity, fairness, scope, and implementation. The norm is now at a critical stage in its lifecycle that will decide whether it gets institutionalised or suffers backsliding and even erosion.

TI Genome-wide Identification and Expression Analysis of the YTH
   Domain-containing RNA-binding Protein Family in Citrus Sinensis
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE
AB In eukaryotic systems, messenger RNA regulations, including splicing, 3'-end formation, editing, localization, and translation, are achieved by different RNA-binding proteins and noncoding RNAs. The YTH domain is a newly identified RNA-binding domain that was identified by comparing its sequence with that of splicing factor YT521-B. Previous study showed that the YTH gene plays an important role in plant resistance to abiotic and biotic stress. In this study, 211 YTH genes were identified in 26 species that represent four major plant lineages. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these genes could be divided into eight subgroups. All of the YTH genes contain a YT521 domain and have different structures. Ten YTH genes were identified in navel orange (Citrus sinensis). The expression profiles of these CitYTH genes were analyzed in different tissues and at different fruit developmental stages, and CitYTH genes displayed distinct expression patterns under heat, cold, salt, and drought stress. Furthermore, expression of the CitYTH genes in response to exogenous hormones was measured. Nuclear localization was also confirmed for five of the proteins encoded by these genes after transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana cells. This study provides valuable information on the role of CitYTHs in the signaling pathways involved in environmental stress responses in Citrus.

TI Androgen receptor (AR)/miR-520f-3p/SOX9 signaling is involved in
   altering hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell sensitivity to the
   Sorafenib therapy under hypoxia via increasing cancer stem cells
   phenotype
SO CANCER LETTERS
AB Early studies indicated that the androgen receptor (AR) might play key roles to impact hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression at different stages. Its linkage to hypoxia, a condition that occurs frequently during the HCC progression, however, remains unclear. Here we found that AR/miR-520f-3p/SOX9 signaling is involved in altering HCC cells sensitivity to the Sorafenib therapy under hypoxia via increasing the cancer stem cells (CSC) population. Mechanism dissection revealed that AR might alter the miR-520f-3p/SOX9 signaling through transcriptional regulation via binding to the androgen-response-elements (AREs) on the promoter region of miR-520f, which could then suppress SOX9 mRNA translation via targeting its 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). The in vivo mouse model with orthotopic xenografts of HCC cells also validated the in vitro data, and a human HCC sample survey confirmed the positive linkage of AR/miR-520f-3p/SOX9 signaling to the CSC population during HCC progression. Together, these preclinical findings suggest that hypoxia may increase the HCC CSC population via altering the AR/miR-520f-3p/SOX9 signaling, and targeting this newly identified signaling with the small molecule, miR-520f-3p, may help in the development of the novel therapy to better suppress the HCC progression.

TI A barley PHD finger transcription factor that confers male sterility by
   affecting tapetal development
SO PLANT BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL
AB Controlling pollen development is of major commercial importance in generating hybrid crops and selective breeding, but characterized genes for male sterility in crops are rare, with no current examples in barley. However, translation of knowledge from model species is now providing opportunities to understand and manipulate such processes in economically important crops. We have used information from regulatory networks in Arabidopsis to identify and functionally characterize a barley PHD transcription factor MALE STERTILITY1 (MS1), which expresses in the anther tapetum and plays a critical role during pollen development. Comparative analysis of Arabidopsis, rice and Brachypodium genomes was used to identify conserved regions in MS1 for primer design to amplify the barley MS1 gene; RACE-PCR was subsequently used to generate the full-length sequence. This gene shows anther-specific tapetal expression, between late tetrad stage and early microspore release. HvMS1 silencing and overexpression in barley resulted in male sterility. Additionally, HvMS1 cDNA, controlled by the native Arabidopsis MS1 promoter, successfully complemented the homozygous ms1 Arabidopsis mutant. These results confirm the conservation of MS1 function in higher plants and in particular in temperate cereals. This has provided the first example of a characterized male sterility gene in barley, which presents a valuable tool for the future control of male fertility in barley for hybrid development.

TI Rhox13 is required for a quantitatively normal first wave of
   spermatogenesis in mice
SO REPRODUCTION
AB We previously described a novel germ cell-specific X-linked reproductive homeobox gene (Rhox13) that is upregulated at the level of translation in response to retinoic acid (RA) in differentiating spermatogonia and preleptotene spermatocytes. We hypothesize that RHOX13 plays an essential role in male germ cell differentiation, and have tested this by creating a Rhox13 gene knockout (KO) mouse. Rhox13 KO mice are born in expected Mendelian ratios, and adults have slightly reduced testis weights, yet a full complement of spermatogenic cell types. Young KO mice (at similar to 7-8 weeks of age) have a approximate to 50% reduction in epididymal sperm counts, but numbers increased to WT levels as the mice reach similar to 17 weeks of age. Histological analysis of testes from juvenile KO mice reveals a number of defects during the first wave of spermatogenesis. These include increased apoptosis, delayed appearance of round spermatids and disruption of the precise stage-specific association of germ cells within the seminiferous tubules. Breeding studies reveal that both young and aged KO males produce normal-sized litters. Taken together, our results indicate that RHOX13 is not essential for mouse fertility in a controlled laboratory setting, but that it is required for optimal development of differentiating germ cells and progression of the first wave of spermatogenesis.

TI The use of alternative polyadenylation sites renders integrin beta 1
   (Itgb1) mRNA isoforms with differential stability during mammary gland
   development
SO BIOCHEMICAL JOURNAL
AB Integrins are heterodimeric cell-surface adhesion receptors that play a critical role in tissue development. Characterization of the full-length mRNA encoding the beta 1 subunit (Itgb1) revealed an alternative functional cleavage and polyadenylation site that yields a new Itgb1 mRNA isoform 578 bp shorter than that previously reported. Using a variety of experimental and bioinformatic approaches, we found that the two Itgb1 isoforms are expressed at different levels in a variety of mouse tissues, including the mammary gland, where they are differentially regulated at successive developmental stages. The longer mRNA species is prevelant during lactation, whereas the shorter is induced after weaning. In 3D cultures, where expression of integrin beta 1 protein is required for normal formation of acini, experimental blockade of the longer isoform induced enhanced expression of the shorter species which allowed normal morphological mammary differentiation. The short isoform lacks AU-rich motifs and miRNA target sequences that are potentially implicated in the regulation of mRNA stability and translation efficiency. We further determined that the AU-binding protein HuR appears to selectively stabilize the longer isoform in the mammary gland. In summary, the results of the present study identify a new regulatory instance involved in the fine-tuning of Itgb1 expression during mammary gland development and function.

TI Exosomal non-coding RNAs: Novel biomarkers with emerging clinical
   applications in gastric cancer
SO MOLECULAR MEDICINE REPORTS
AB Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common types of malignant tumor and it demonstrates high mortality rates. The majority of cases of GC are diagnosed at an advanced stage, which seriously endangers the health of the patient. Therefore, discovering a novel diagnostic method for GC is a current priority. Exosomes are 40 to 150-nm-diameter vesicles consisting of a lipid bilayer secreted by a variety of cells that exist in multiple different types of body fluids. Exosomes contain diverse types of active substances, including RNAs, proteins and lipids, and play important roles in tumor cell communication, metastasis and neovascularization, as well as tumor growth. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) do not code proteins, and instead have roles in a variety of genetic mechanisms, such as regulating the structure, expression and stability of RNAs, and modulating the translation and function of proteins. In recent years, exosomal ncRNAs have become a novel focus in research. An increasing number of studies have demonstrated that exosomal ncRNAs can be used in the prediction and treatment of GC. The present review briefly discusses the role of exosomal ncRNAs as a potential biomarker, and summarizes important regulatory genes involved in the development and progression of GC.

AB N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are a subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptor, which play a central role in learning, memory, and synaptic development. NMDARs are assembled as tetramers composed of two GluN1 subunits and two GluN2 or GluN3 subunits. Although NMDARs are widely expressed throughout the central nervous system, their number, localization, and subunit composition are strictly regulated and differ in a cell- and synapse-specific manner. The brain area, developmental stage, and level of synaptic activity are some of the factors that regulate NMDARs. Molecular mechanisms that control subunit-specific NMDAR function include developmental regulation of subunit transcription/translation, differential trafficking through the secretory pathway, posttranscriptional modifications such as phosphorylation, and protein-protein interactions. The GluN2A and GluN2B subunits are highly expressed in cortex and hippocampus and confer many of the distinct properties on endogenous NMDARs. Importantly, the synaptic NMDAR subunit composition changes from predominantly GluN2B-containing to GluN2A-containing NMDARs during synaptic maturation and in response to activity and experience. Some of the molecular mechanisms underlying this GluN2 subunit switch have been recently identified. In addition, the balance between synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDARs is altered in several neuronal disorders. Here, the authors summarize the recent advances in the identification of NMDAR subunit-specific regulatory mechanisms.

TI Crosstalk between Noncoding RNAs and the Epigenetics Machinery in
   Pediatric Tumors and Their Microenvironment
SO CANCERS
AB According to the World Health Organization, every year, an estimated 400,000+ new cancer cases affect children under the age of 20 worldwide. Unlike adult cancers, pediatric cancers develop very early in life due to alterations in signaling pathways that regulate embryonic development, and environmental factors do not contribute much to cancer development. The highly organized complex microenvironment controlled by synchronized gene expression patterns plays an essential role in the embryonic stages of development. Dysregulated development can lead to tumor initiation and growth. The low mutational burden in pediatric tumors suggests the predominant role of epigenetic changes in driving the cancer phenotype. However, one more upstream layer of regulation driven by ncRNAs regulates gene expression and signaling pathways involved in the development. Deregulation of ncRNAs can alter the epigenetic machinery of a cell, affecting the transcription and translation profiles of gene regulatory networks required for cellular proliferation and differentiation during embryonic development. Therefore, it is essential to understand the role of ncRNAs in pediatric tumor development to accelerate translational research to discover new treatments for childhood cancers. This review focuses on the role of ncRNA in regulating the epigenetics of pediatric tumors and their tumor microenvironment, the impact of their deregulation on driving pediatric tumor progress, and their potential as effective therapeutic targets.

TI Detection and Quantification of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein
   1 (FMRP)
SO GENES
AB The final product of FMR1 gene transcription, Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein 1 (FMRP), is an RNA binding protein that acts as a repressor of translation. FMRP is expressed in several tissues and plays important roles in neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and ovarian functions and has been implicated in a number of neuropsychological disorders. The loss of FMRP causes Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). In most cases, FXS is due to large expansions of a CGG repeat in FMR1-normally containing 6-54 repeats-to over 200 CGGs and identified as full mutation (FM). Hypermethylation of the repeat induces FMR1 silencing and lack of FMRP expression in FM male. Mosaic FM males express low levels of FMRP and present a less severe phenotype that inversely correlates with FMRP levels. Carriers of pre-mutations (55-200 CGG) show increased mRNA, and normal to reduced FMRP levels. Alternative splicing of FMR1 mRNA results in 24 FMRP predicted isoforms whose expression are tissues and developmentally regulated. Here, we summarize the approaches used by several laboratories including our own to (a) detect and estimate the amount of FMRP in different tissues, developmental stages and various pathologies; and (b) to accurately quantifying FMRP for a direct diagnosis of FXS in adults and newborns.

TI Musashi-2 is a novel regulator of paclitaxel sensitivity in ovarian
   cancer cells
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY
AB As few prognostic markers and symptoms have been identified, ovarian cancer is typically diagnosed at an advanced stage, and a majority of patients will relapse and develop resistance to anticancer drugs such as paclitaxel. Musashi-2 (MSI2) is a regulator of gene translation and functions as an oncogenic protein and a marker of poor prognosis in various types of cancer. However, the biological and clinical significance of MSI2 in ovarian cancer remains unclear. Using a tissue microarray-based assay, we demonstrated that MSI2 was highly expressed in advanced, serous ovarian cancer tissues. In addition, MSI2-overexpressing ovarian cancer cells exhibited increased viability, proliferation and growth. We found that MSI2 was overexpressed in paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer SKOV3-TR cells but not in paclitaxel-sensitive cell lines. The loss of MSI2 expression in lentivirus-mediated stable MSI2 knockdown SKOV3-TR cells impaired paclitaxel resistance as determined using cell viability and apoptosis assays. In contrast, lentivirus-mediated MSI2 overexpression promoted the development of paclitaxel resistance in paclitaxel-sensitive ovarian cancer cells. The results of the present study are the first to demonstrate that MSI2 is a valuable marker of advanced, serous ovarian cancer and that MSI2 plays an important role in paclitaxel resistance.

TI CNN3 Is Regulated by microRNA-1 during Muscle Development in Pigs
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB The calponin 3 (CNN3) gene has important functions involved in skeletal muscle development. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play critical role in myogenesis by influencing the mRNA stability or protein translation of target gene. Based on paired microRNA and mRNA profiling in the prenatal skeletal muscle of pigs, our previous study suggested that CNN3 was differentially expressed and a potential target for miR-1. To further understand the biological function and regulation mechanism of CNN3, we performed co-expression analysis of CNN3 and miR-1 in developmental skeletal muscle tissues (16 stages) from Tongcheng (a Chinese domestic breed, obese-type) and Landrace (a Western, lean-type) pigs, respectively. Subsequently, dual luciferase and western blot assays were carried out. During skeletal muscle development, we observe a significantly negative expression correlation between the miR-1 and CNN3 at mRNA level. Our dual luciferase and western blot results suggested that the CNN3 gene was regulated by miR-1. We identified four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) contained within the CNN3 gene. Association analysis indicated that these CNN3 SNPs are significantly associated with birth weight (BW) and the 21-day weaning weight of the piglets examined. These facts indicate that CNN3 is a candidate gene associated with growth traits and regulated by miR-1 during skeletal muscle development in pigs.

TI The Role of miRNAs in Neuropathic Pain
SO BIOMEDICINES
AB Neuropathic pain is a debilitating condition affecting around 8% of the adult population in the UK. The pathophysiology is complex and involves a wide range of processes, including alteration of neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission, dysregulated intracellular signalling and activation of pro-inflammatory immune and glial cells. In the past 15 years, multiple miRNAs-small non-coding RNA-have emerged as regulators of neuropathic pain development. They act by binding to target mRNAs and preventing the translation into proteins. Due to their short sequence (around 22 nucleotides in length), they can have hundreds of targets and regulate several pathways. Several studies on animal models have highlighted numerous miRNAs that play a role in neuropathic pain development at various stages of the nociceptive pathways, including neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission, intracellular signalling and communication with non-neuronal cells. Studies on animal models do not always translate in the clinic; fewer studies on miRNAs have been performed involving human subjects with neuropathic pain, with differing results depending on the specific aetiology underlying neuropathic pain. Further studies using human tissue and liquid samples (serum, plasma, saliva) will help highlight miRNAs that are relevant to neuropathic pain diagnosis or treatment, as biomarkers or potential drug targets.

TI Identification of putative miRNA biomarkers in early rheumatoid
   arthritis by genome-wide microarray profiling: A pilot study
SO GENE
AB Despite the existing research, the etiology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an autoimmune disease remains poorly understood with early and accurate diagnosis difficult to achieve. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in biological processes as modulators of transcription and translation. Previous studies have demonstrated a downregulation of several genes in' early RA stages and in addition, miRNAs may serve as early biomarkers of subclinical changes in early RA.
   When comparing the four groups (ANOVA P < 0.01, fold change > 4), we found 253 differentially expressed miRNAs. Of these, 97 miRNAs were identified as overexpressed in early rheumatoid arthritis. The validation of miRNA microarray expression was performed in a set by RT-qPCR and showed strong agreement with microarray expression data. The putative targets of overexpressed microRNAs in early RA were significantly enriched in apoptosis, tolerance loss and Wnt pathways. Moreover, ROC analysis showed values of AUC 0.76 and P < 0.05 for miR 361-5p, identifying this miRNA as a potential biomarker of disease.
   We identified specific microRNAs associated with early rheumatoid arthritis and proposed them as early biomarkers of disease. Our results provide novel insight into immune disease physiopathology and describe unreported microRNAs in RA with potential for clinical use.

TI Protein Disulfide Isomerase Inhibitor Suppresses Viral Replication and
   Production during Antibody-Dependent Enhancement of Dengue Virus
   Infection in Human Monocytic Cells
SO VIRUSES-BASEL
AB One of several mechanisms that leads to the development of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) is called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Monocytes can be infected by the ADE phenomenon, which occurs in dengue secondary infection. This study aimed to investigate the proteins involved in ADE of DENV infection in the human monocytic cell line U937. The phosphoproteins were used to perform and analyze for protein expression using mass spectrometry (GeLC-MS/MS). The differential phosphoproteins revealed 1131 altered proteins compared between isotype- and DENV-specific antibody-treated monocytes. The altered proteins revealed 558 upregulated proteins and 573 downregulated proteins. Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), which is an enzyme that had a high-ranking fold change and that catalyzes the formation, breakage, and rearrangement of disulfide bonds within a protein molecule, was selected for further study. PDI was found to be important for dengue virus infectivity during the ADE model. The effect of PDI inhibition was also shown to be involved in the early stage of life cycle by time-of-drug-addition assay. These results suggest that PDI is important for protein translation and virion assembly of dengue virus during infection in human monocytes, and it may play a significant role as a chaperone to stabilize dengue protein synthesis.

TI On the Cutting Edge of Oral Cancer Prevention: Finding Risk-Predictive
   Markers in Precancerous Lesions by Longitudinal Studies
SO CELLS
AB Early identification and management of precancerous lesions at high risk of developing cancers is the most effective and economical way to reduce the incidence, mortality, and morbidity of cancers as well as minimizing treatment-related complications, including pain, impaired functions, and disfiguration. Reliable cancer-risk-predictive markers play an important role in enabling evidence-based decision making as well as providing mechanistic insight into the malignant conversion of precancerous lesions. The focus of this article is to review updates on markers that may predict the risk of oral premalignant lesions (OPLs) in developing into oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs), which can logically be discovered only by prospective or retrospective longitudinal studies that analyze pre-progression OPL samples with long-term follow-up outcomes. These risk-predictive markers are different from those that prognosticate the survival outcome of cancers after they have been diagnosed and treated, or those that differentiate between different lesion types and stages. Up-to-date knowledge on cancer-risk-predictive markers discovered by longitudinally followed studies will be reviewed. The goal of this endeavor is to use this information as a starting point to address some key challenges limiting our progress in this area in the hope of achieving effective translation of research discoveries into new clinical interventions.

TI Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of pre-diapause and non-diapause
   eggs of migratory locust, Locusta migratoria L. (Orthoptera: Acridoidea)
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Low temperature induces diapause in locusts. However, the physiological processes and initiation mechanism of diapause are not well understood. To understand the molecular basis of diapause, 'omics' analyses were performed to examine the differences between diapause and non-diapause eggs at both transcriptional and translational levels. Results indicated that a total of 62,241 mRNAs and 212 proteins were differentially expressed. Among them, 116 transcripts had concurrent transcription and translation profiles. Up-regulated genes related to diapause included glutathionesS- transferase et al., and down-regulated genes including juvenile hormone esterase-like protein et al. KEGG analysis mapped 7,243 and 99 differentially expressed genes and proteins, to 83 and 25 pathways, respectively. Correlation enriched pathways indicated that there were nine identical pathways related to diapause. Gene Ontology analysis placed these genes and proteins into three categories, and a higher proportion of genes related to metabolism was up-regulated than downregulated. Furthermore, three up-regulated pathways were linked to cryoprotection. This study demonstrates the applicability of high-throughput omics tools to identify molecules linked to diapause in the locust. In addition, it reveals cellular metabolism in diapause eggs is more active than in non-diapause eggs, and up-regulated enzymes may play roles in cryoprotection and storing energy for diapause and post-diapause stages.

TI Vaccinia virus D10 has broad decapping activity that is regulated by
   mRNA splicing
SO PLOS PATHOGENS
AB The mRNA 5' cap structure serves both to protect transcripts from degradation and promote their translation. Cap removal is thus an integral component of mRNA turnover that is carried out by cellular decapping enzymes, whose activity is tightly regulated and coupled to other stages of the mRNA decay pathway. The poxvirus vaccinia virus (VACV) encodes its own decapping enzymes, D9 and D10, that act on cellular and viral mRNA, but may be regulated differently than their cellular counterparts. Here, we evaluated the targeting potential of these viral enzymes using RNA sequencing from cells infected with wild-type and decapping mutant versions of VACV as well as in uninfected cells expressing D10. We found that D9 and D10 target an overlapping subset of viral transcripts but that D10 plays a dominant role in depleting the vast majority of human transcripts, although not in an indiscriminate manner. Unexpectedly, the splicing architecture of a gene influences how robustly its corresponding transcript is targeted by D10, as transcripts derived from intronless genes are less susceptible to enzymatic decapping by D10. As all VACV genes are intronless, preferential decapping of transcripts from intron-containing genes provides an unanticipated mechanism for the virus to disproportionately deplete host transcripts and remodel the infected cell transcriptome.

TI Quantitative proteomic comparison of stationary/G(0) phase cells and
   tetrads in budding yeast
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Most of the microbial cells on earth under natural conditions exist in a dormant condition, commonly known as quiescent state. Quiescent cells exhibit low rates of transcription and translation suggesting that cellular abundance of proteins may be similar in quiescent cells. Therefore, this study aim to compare the proteome of budding yeast cells from two quiescent states viz. stationary phase/G(0) and tetrads. Using iTRAQ (isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation) based quantitative proteomics we identified 289 proteins, among which around 40 proteins exhibited +/- 1.5 fold change consistently from the four biological replicates. Proteomics data was validated by western blot and denstiometric analysis of Hsp12 and Spg4. Level of budding yeast 14-3-3 proteins was found to be similar in both the quiescent states, whereas Hsp12 and Spg4 expressed only during stress. FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorting) analysis showed that budding yeast cells were arrested at G(1) stages both in tetrads as well as in stationary phase. We also observed that quiescent states did not express Ime1 (inducer of meiosis). Taken together, our present study demonstrates that the cells in quiescent state may have similar proteome, and accumulation of proteins like Hsp12, Hsp26, and Spg4 may play an important role in retaining viability of the cells during dormancy.

TI Targeting NAD(+) in translational research to relieve diseases and
   conditions of metabolic stress and ageing
SO MECHANISMS OF AGEING AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) plays a fundamental role in life and health through the regulation of energy biogenesis, redox homeostasis, cell metabolism, and the arbitration of cell survival via linkages to apoptosis and autophagic pathways. The importance of HAD(+) in ageing and healthy longevity has been revealed from laboratory animal studies and early-stage clinical testing. While basic researchers and clinicians have investigated the molecular mechanisms and translation potential of HAD(+), there are still major gaps in applying laboratory science to design the most effective trials. This mini-review was based on the programme and discussions of the 3rd NO-Age Symposium held at the Akershus University Hospital, Norway on the 28th October 2019. This symposium brought together leading basic researchers on NAD(+) and clinicians who are leading or are going to perform NAD(+) augmentation-related clinical studies. This meeting covered talks about NAD(+) synthetic pathways, subcellular homeostasis of NAD(+), the benefits of NAD(+) augmentation from maternal milk to offspring, current clinical trials of the NAD(+) precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR) on Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T), Parkinson's disease (PD), post-sepsis fatigue, as well as other potential NR-based clinical trials. Importantly, a consensus is emerging with respect to the design of clinical trials in order to measure meaningful parameters and ensure safety.

TI A Novel lncRNA, LINC00460, Affects Cell Proliferation and Apoptosis by
   Regulating KLF2 and CUL4A Expression in Colorectal Cancer
SO MOLECULAR THERAPY-NUCLEIC ACIDS
AB Emerging evidence has proven that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in human colorectal cancer (CRC) biology, although few lncRNAs have been characterized in CRC. Therefore, the functional significance of lncRNAs in the malignant progression of CRC still needs to be further explored. In this study, through analyzing TCGA RNA sequencing data and other publicly available microarray data, we found a novel lncRNA, LINC00460, whose expression was significantly upregulated in CRC tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. Consistently, real-time qPCR results also verified that LINC00460 was overexpressed in CRC tissues and cells. Furthermore, high LINC00460 expression levels in CRC specimens were correlated with larger tumor size, advanced tumor stage, lymph node metastasis and shorter overall survival. In vitro and in vivo assays of LINC00460 alterations revealed a complex integrated phenotype affecting cell growth and apoptosis. Mechanistically, LINC00460 repressed Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) transcription by binding to enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2). LINC00460 also functioned as a molecular sponge for miR-149-5p, antagonizing its ability to repress cullin 4A (CUL4A) protein translation. Taken together, our findings support a model in which the LINC00460/EZH2/KLF2 and LINC00460/miR-149-5p/CUL4A crosstalk serve as critical effectors in CRC tumorigenesis and progression, suggesting new therapeutic directions in CRC.

TI The importance of m(6)A topology in chicken embryo mRNA: a precise
   mapping of m(6)A at the conserved chicken beta-actin zipcode
SO RNA
AB N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) in mRNA regulates almost every stage in the mRNA life cycle, and the development of methodologies for the high-throughput detection of methylated sites in mRNA using m(6)A-specific methylated RNA immuno-precipitation with next-generation sequencing (MeRIPSeq) or m(6)A individual-nucleotide-resolution cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (miCLIP) have revolutionized the m(6)A research field. Both of these methods are based on immunoprecipitation of fragmented mRNA. However, it is well documented that antibodies often have nonspecific activities, thus verification of identified m(6)A sites using an antibody-independent method would be highly desirable. We mapped and quantified the m(6)A site in the chicken beta-actin zipcode based on the data from chicken embryo MeRIPSeq results and our RNA-Epimodification Detection and Base-Recognition (RedBaron) antibody-independent assay. We also demonstrated that methylation of this site in the beta-actin zipcode enhances ZBP1 binding in vitro, while methylation of a nearby adenosine abolishes binding. This suggests that m(6)A may play a role in regulating localized translation of beta-actin mRNA, and the ability of m(6)A to enhance or inhibit a reader protein's RNA binding highlights the importance of m(6)A detection at nucleotide resolution.

TI Placement patterns of English and French conjunctive adjuncts of
   contrast The impact of register
SO LANGUAGES IN CONTRAST
AB In many languages, conjunctive adjuncts (e.g. however, therefore) are syntactically mobile. Several corpus-based contrastive studies have shown that languages differ in the positions that they tend to prefer for conjunctive adjuncts. However, the studies available have formulated general cross-linguistic differences in placement for languages as wholes, without considering the possibility that such contrasts may be influenced by register. The objective of this paper is to investigate and compare the placement patterns of English and French conjunctive adjuncts of contrast in two written registers (viz. editorials and research articles) in order to measure the impact of register variation on the differences between these two languages. The results suggest that, although register variation plays a significant role on placement within each language system, language is a better predictor of placement than register, since cross-linguistic differences in placement between English and French are stable across communicative situations. In a second stage, the results obtained in the comparable corpus study are complemented with the analysis of translation data, with a view to assessing the translators' degree of awareness of the inherent word order preferences of the target language. The study is grounded in the framework of Systemic Functional Linguistics and relies on the notions of Theme and Rheme to describe conjunctive adjunct placement.

TI The Failure of the Largest Project to Dismantle Hydroelectric Dams in
   Europe? (Selune River, France, 2009-2017)
SO WATER ALTERNATIVES-AN INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL ON WATER POLITICS AND
   DEVELOPMENT
AB The removal of two hydropower dams announced by the French government in November 2009 would have been an unprecedented operation at European scale due to their dimensions (36 and 16 m high). But this project has been strongly criticized at local level by elected officials and users. The Actor Network Theory is used to reconstitute the successive stages of the consultation process, from the first discussions about the future of the dams (2005) to the downgrading of the project (2016), finally leading to a simple draining of the lake and inspection of the dam. The ANT approach and the methodology based on stakeholder interviews and participant observation are fruitful to identify the actors - humans and non-humans like salmon or lakes - and to analyse their position in sociotechnical networks pro or against dam removal. This method aims to reconstruct the whole process of setting up the campaign groups and their trajectory and to understand the shaping of representations and values. It shows the opposite visions developed by the opponents and defenders of the dam concerning salmon and running/standing water. The way the dialogue process was conducted also plays a crucial role. Interrupted and characterized by many uncertainties, it failed in allowing a translation between expertise and local knowledge.

TI Translational genomics and head and neck cancer: toward precision
   medicine
SO CLINICAL GENETICS
AB Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) comprise a wide spectrum of neoplasms with different tumor biologies, prognosis and response to therapies. Current tumor classification and traditional diagnostic methods (e.g. clinical assessment, histopathology) are limited in their capacity to determine prognosis and clinical decision-making. Despite recent improvements in treatment, the outcome for patients with HNSCC remains poor. Similar to most tumors, several patient-related factors, (e.g. genetics and environment) and disease-related factors (e.g. tumor location, TMN staging) play a significant role on survival. Thus, the problem in defining the prognosis is that the clinical course and response to treatment differ considerably among patients. Such interindividual variability is related to the heterogeneity of the tumor, genetic and epigenetic variations, thus reflecting the interaction of multiple biological components that result in a unique phenotype. Integrative genomics are developed to identify the molecular pathways leading to cancer at the individual level and find novel prognostic markers for HNSCC, hence tailoring a treatment accordingly. Such genetic-based personalized diagnosis allows tumor stratification and implementation of targeted therapy. Modern medicine includes new drugs that disrupt the implicated molecules and their signaling pathways. Here, we summarize the current state of knowledge that elucidates the translation of genetic data into clinical benefit.

TI Nanomedicine for Infectious Disease Applications: Innovation towards
   Broad-Spectrum Treatment of Viral Infections
SO SMALL
AB Nanomedicine enables unique diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities to tackle problems in clinical medicine. As multifunctional agents with programmable properties, nanomedicines are poised to revolutionize treatment strategies. This promise is especially evident for infectious disease applications, for which the continual emergence, re-emergence, and evolution of pathogens has proven difficult to counter by conventional approaches. Herein, a conceptual framework is presented that envisions possible routes for the development of nanomedicines as superior broad-spectrum antiviral agents against enveloped viruses. With lipid membranes playing a critical role in the life cycle of medically important enveloped viruses including HIV, influenza, and Ebola, cellular and viral membrane interfaces are ideal elements to incorporate into broad-spectrum antiviral strategies. Examples are presented that demonstrate how nanomedicine strategies inspired by lipid membranes enable a wide range of targeting opportunities to gain control of critical stages in the virus life cycle through either direct or indirect approaches involving membrane interfaces. The capabilities can be realized by enabling new inhibitory functions or improving the function of existing drugs through nanotechnology-enabled solutions. With these exciting opportunities, due attention is also given to the clinical translation of nanomedicines for infectious disease applications, especially as pharmaceutical drug-discovery pipelines demand new routes of innovation.

TI Overexpression of eIF3e is correlated with colon tumor development and
   poor prognosis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PATHOLOGY
AB EIF3e is a component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF-3) complexes, which is an essential factor for initiation of protein synthesis in mammalian cells. Translational control plays key roles in the complex mechanism of cancer development and progression. However, the clinical significance of eIF3e in colon cancer remains to be elucidated. We analyzed the eIF3e expression in a tissue microarray (TMA), which contained 173 colon cancer tissues paired with adjacent normal mucosa and lymph node metastasis. The expression of eIF3e was significantly elevated in colon cancer tissues in comparison with those in adjacent normal mucosa (P < 0.001) and lymph node metastasis (P < 0.001). The high expression of eIF3e in colon cancer was significantly correlated with tumor size (P < 0.001), lymph node involvement (P < 0.001), distant metastasis (P < 0.001), clinical stage (P < 0.001), histopathologic classification (P < 0.001), and vessel invasion (P = 0.036). Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that eIF3e is an independent prognosis factor for overall survival and disease-free survival in colon cancer. Down-regulation of eIF3e in vitro inhibited colon cancer cell proliferation, clonality and promoted cell apoptosis. Taken together, high eIF3e expression may contribute to tumor progression and predict poor prognosis in colon cancer.

TI Research progress concerning m(6)A methylation and cancer
SO ONCOLOGY LETTERS
AB N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) methylation is a type of methylation modification on RNA molecules, which was first discovered in 1974, and has become a hot topic in life science in recent years. m(6)A modification is an epigenetic regulation similar to DNA and histone modification and is dynamically reversible in mammalian cells. This chemical marker of RNA is produced by m(6)A 'writers' (methylase) and can be degraded by m(6)A 'erasers' (demethylase). Methylated reading protein is the 'reader', that can recognize the mRNA containing m(6)A and regulate the expression of downstream genes accordingly. m(6)A methylation is involved in all stages of the RNA life cycle, including RNA processing, nuclear export, translation and regulation of RNA degradation, indicating that m(6)A plays a crucial role in RNA metabolism. Recent studies have shown that m(6)A modification is a complicated regulatory network in different cell lines, tissues and spatio-temporal models, and m(6)A methylation is associated with the occurrence and development of tumors. The present review describes the regulatory mechanism and physiological functions of m(6)A methylation, and its research progress in several types of human tumor, to provide novel approaches for early diagnosis and targeted treatment of cancer.

TI Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Signaling in Plant Immunity-At the
   Crossroad of Life and Death
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB Rapid and complex immune responses are induced in plants upon pathogen recognition. One form of plant defense response is a programmed burst in transcription and translation of pathogenesis-related proteins, of which many rely on ER processing. Interestingly, several ER stress marker genes are up-regulated during early stages of immune responses, suggesting that enhanced ER capacity is needed for immunity. Eukaryotic cells respond to ER stress through conserved signaling networks initiated by specific ER stress sensors tethered to the ER membrane. Depending on the nature of ER stress the cell prioritizes either survival or initiates programmed cell death (PCD). At present two plant ER stress sensors, bZIP28 and IRE1, have been described. Both sensor proteins are involved in ER stress-induced signaling, but only IRE1 has been additionally linked to immunity. A second branch of immune responses relies on PCD. In mammals, ER stress sensors are involved in activation of PCD, but it is unclear if plant ER stress sensors play a role in PCD. Nevertheless, some ER resident proteins have been linked to pathogen-induced cell death in plants. In this review, we will discuss the current understanding of plant ER stress signaling and its cross-talk with immune signaling.

TI Regulation of the parental gene GRM4 by circGrm4 RNA transcript and
   glutamate-mediated neurovascular toxicity in eyes
SO MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Epigenetic memory plays crucial roles in gene regulation. It not only modulates the expression of specific genes but also has ripple effects on transcription as well as translation of other genes. Very often an alteration in expression occurs either via methylation or demethylation. In this context, "1-carbon metabolism" assumes a special significance since its dysregulation by higher levels of homocysteine; Hcy (known as hyperhomocysteinemia; HHcy), a byproduct of "1-Carbon Metabolism" during methionine biosynthesis leads to serious implications in cardiovascular, renal, cerebrovascular systems, and a host of other conditions. Currently, the circular RNAs (circRNAs) generated via non-canonical back-splicing events from the pre-mRNA molecules are at the center stage for their essential roles in diseases via their epigenetic manifestations. We recently identified a circular RNA transcript (circGRM4) that is significantly upregulated in the eye of cystathionine beta-synthase-deficient mice. We also discovered a concurrent over-expression of the mGLUR4 receptor in the eyes of these mice. In brief, circGRM4 is selectively transcribed from its parental mGLUR4 receptor gene (GRM4) functions as a "molecular-sponge" for the miRNAs and results into excessive turnover of the mGLUR4 receptor in the eye in response to extremely high circulating glutamate concentration. We opine that this epigenetic manifestation potentially predisposes HHcy people to retinovascular malfunctioning.

TI Supplying the trip to antibody production-nutrients, signaling, and the
   programming of cellular metabolism in the mature B lineage
SO CELLULAR & MOLECULAR IMMUNOLOGY
AB The COVID pandemic has refreshed and expanded recognition of the vital role that sustained antibody (Ab) secretion plays in our immune defenses against microbes and of the importance of vaccines that elicit Ab protection against infection. With this backdrop, it is especially timely to review aspects of the molecular programming that govern how the cells that secrete Abs arise, persist, and meet the challenge of secreting vast amounts of these glycoproteins. Whereas plasmablasts and plasma cells (PCs) are the primary sources of secreted Abs, the process leading to the existence of these cell types starts with naive B lymphocytes that proliferate and differentiate toward several potential fates. At each step, cells reside in specific microenvironments in which they not only receive signals from cytokines and other cell surface receptors but also draw on the interstitium for nutrients. Nutrients in turn influence flux through intermediary metabolism and sensor enzymes that regulate gene transcription, translation, and metabolism. This review will focus on nutrient supply and how sensor mechanisms influence distinct cellular stages that lead to PCs and their adaptations as factories dedicated to Ab secretion. Salient findings of this group and others, sometimes exhibiting differences, will be summarized with regard to the journey to a distinctive metabolic program in PCs.

TI Physically-Inspired Gaussian Process Models for Post-Transcriptional
   Regulation in Drosophila
SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND BIOINFORMATICS
AB The regulatory process of Drosophila is thoroughly studied for understanding a great variety of biological principles. While pattern-forming gene networks are analyzed in the transcription step, post-transcriptional events (e.g., translation, protein processing) play an important role in establishing protein expression patterns and levels. Since the post-transcriptional regulation of Drosophila depends on spatiotemporal interactions between mRNAs and gap proteins, proper physically-inspired stochastic models are required to study the link between both quantities. Previous research attempts have shown that using Gaussian processes (GPs) and differential equations lead to promising predictions when analyzing regulatory networks. Here, we aim at further investigating two types of physically-inspired GP models based on a reaction-diffusion equation where the main difference lies in where the prior is placed. While one of them has been studied previously using protein data only, the other is novel and yields a simple approach requiring only the differentiation of kernel functions. In contrast to other stochastic frameworks, discretizing the spatial space is not required here. Both GP models are tested under different conditions depending on the availability of gap gene mRNA expression data. Finally, their performances are assessed on a high-resolution dataset describing the blastoderm stage of the early embryo of Drosophila melanogaster.

TI Real-Time Fluorescence Image-Guided Oncologic Surgery
SO EMERGING APPLICATIONS OF MOLECULAR IMAGING TO ONCOLOGY
SE Advances in Cancer Research
AB Medical imaging plays a critical role in cancer diagnosis and planning. Many of these patients rely on surgical intervention for curative outcomes. This requires a careful identification of the primary and microscopic tumors, and the complete removal of cancer. Although there have been efforts to adapt traditional-imaging modalities for intraoperative image guidance, they suffer from several constraints such as large hardware footprint, high-operation cost, and disruption of the surgical workflow. Because of the ease of image acquisition, relatively low-cost devices and intuitive operation, optical imaging methods have received tremendous interests for use in real-time image-guided surgery. To improve imaging depth under low interference by tissue autofluorescence, many of these applications utilize light in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, which is invisible to human eyes. With the availability of a wide selection of tumor-avid contrast agents, advancements in imaging sensors, electronic and optical designs, surgeons are able to combine different attributes of NIR optical imaging techniques to improve treatment outcomes. The emergence of diverse commercial and experimental image guidance systems, which are in various stages of clinical translation, attests to the potential high impact of intraoperative optical imaging methods to improve speed of oncologic surgery with high accuracy and minimal margin positivity.

TI Anti-DKK1 antibody promotes bone fracture healing through activation of
   beta-catenin signaling
SO BONE
AB In this study we investigated if Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in mesenchymal progenitor cells plays a role in bone fracture repair and if DKK1-Ab promotes fracture healing through activation of beta-catenin signaling. Unilateral open transverse tibial fractures were created in CD1 mice and in beta-catenin(Prx1ER) conditional knockout (KO) and Cre-negative control mice (C57BL/6 background). Bone fracture callus tissues were collected and analyzed by radiography, micro-CT (mu CT), histology, biomechanical testing and gene expression analysis. The results demonstrated that treatment with DKK1-Ab promoted bone callus formation and increased mechanical strength during the fracture healing process in CD1 mice. DKK1-Ab enhanced fracture repair by activation of endochondral ossification. The normal rate of bone repair was delayed when the beta-catenin gene was conditionally deleted in mesenchymal progenitor cells during the early stages of fracture healing. DKK1-Ab appeared to act through beta-catenin signaling to enhance bone repair since the beneficial effect of DKK1-Ab was abrogated in beta-catenin(Prx1ER) conditional KO mice. Further understanding of the signaling mechanism of DKK1-Ab in bone formation and bone regeneration may facilitate the clinical translation of this anabolic agent into therapeutic intervention.

TI The RNA-binding protein Staufen1 impairs myogenic differentiation via a
   c-myc-dependent mechanism
SO MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF THE CELL
AB Recent work has shown that Staufen1 plays key roles in skeletal muscle, yet little is known about its pattern of expression during embryonic and postnatal development. Here we first show that Staufen1 levels are abundant in mouse embryonic muscles and that its expression decreases thereafter, reaching low levels in mature muscles. A similar pattern of expression is seen as cultured myoblasts differentiate into myotubes. Muscle degeneration/regeneration experiments revealed that Staufen1 increases after cardiotoxin injection before returning to the low levels seen in mature muscles. We next prevented the decrease in Staufen1 during differentiation by generating stable C2C12 muscle cell lines overexpressing Staufen1. Cells overexpressing Staufen1 differentiated poorly, as evidenced by reductions in the differentiation and fusion indices and decreases in MyoD, myogenin, MEF2A, and MEF2C, independently of Staufen-mediated mRNA decay. However, levels of c-myc, a factor known to inhibit differentiation, were increased in C2C12 cells overexpressing Staufen1 through enhanced translation. By contrast, the knockdown of Staufen1 decreased c-myc levels in myoblasts. Collectively our results show that Staufen1 is highly expressed during early stages of differentiation/development and that it can impair differentiation by regulating c-myc, thereby highlighting the multifunctional role of Staufen1 in skeletal muscle cells.

TI Amyloid beta soluble forms and plasminogen activation system in
   Alzheimer's disease: Consequences on extracellular maturation of
   brain-derived neurotrophic factor and therapeutic implications
SO CNS NEUROSCIENCE & THERAPEUTICS
AB Soluble oligomeric forms of amyloid beta (A beta) play an important role in causing the cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) by targeting and disrupting synaptic pathways. Thus, the present research is directed toward identifying the neuronal pathways targeted by soluble forms and, accordingly, develops alternative therapeutic strategies. The neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is synthesized as a precursor (pro-BDNF) which is cleaved extracellularly by plasmin to release the mature form. The conversion from pro-BDNF to BDNF is an important process that regulates neuronal activity and memory processes. Plasmin-dependent maturation of BDNF in the brain is regulated by plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), the natural inhibitor of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA). Therefore, tPA/PAI-1 system represents an important regulator of extracellular BDNF/pro-BDNF ratio. In this review, we summarize the data on the components of the plasminogen activation system and on BDNF in AD. Moreover, we will hypothesize a possible pathogenic mechanism caused by soluble A beta forms based on the effects on tPA/PAI-1 system and on the consequence of an altered conversion from pro-BDNF to the mature BDNF in the brain of AD patients. Translation into clinic may include a better characterization of the disease stage and future direction on therapeutic targets.

TI Radiolabeled bombesin derivatives for preclinical oncological imaging
SO BIOMEDICINE & PHARMACOTHERAPY
AB Despite efforts, cancer is still one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with approximately 14 million new cases and 8.2 million cancer-related deaths each year, according to the World Health Organization. Among the strategies to reduce cancer progression and improving its management, implementing early detection technologies is crucial. Based on the fact that several types of cancer cells overexpress surface receptors, small molecule ligands, such as peptides, have been developed to allow tumor identification at earlier stages. Allied with imaging techniques such as PET and SPECT, radiolabeled peptides play a pivotal role in nuclear medicine. Bombesin, a peptide of 14 amino acids, is an amphibian homolog to the mammalian gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), that has been extensively studied as a targeting ligand for diagnosis and therapy of GRP positive tumors, such as breast, pancreas, lungs and prostate cancers. In this context, herein we provide a review of reported bombesin derivatives radiolabeled with a multitude of radioactive isotopes for diagnostic purposes in the preclinical setting. Moreover, since animal models are highly relevant for assessing the potential of clinical translation of this radiopeptides, a brief report of the currently used GRP-positive tumor-bearing animal models is described.

TI Lariat intronic RNAs in the cytoplasm of Xenopus tropicalis oocytes
SO RNA
AB We previously demonstrated that the oocyte nucleus (germinal vesicle or GV) of Xenopus tropicalis contains a population of stable RNA molecules derived from the introns of most expressed genes. Here we show that similar stable intronic sequence (sis) RNAs occur in the oocyte cytoplasm. About 9000 cytoplasmic sisRNAs have been identified, all of which are resistant to the exonuclease RNase R. About half have been confirmed as lariat molecules and the rest are presumed to be lariats, whereas nuclear sisRNAs are a mixture of lariat and linear molecules. Cytoplasmic sisRNAs are more abundant on a molar basis than nuclear sisRNAs and are derived from short introns, mostly under 1 kb in length. Both nuclear and cytoplasmic sisRNAs are transmitted intact to the egg at GV breakdown and persist until at least the blastula stage of embryogenesis, when zygotic transcription begins. We compared cytoplasmic sisRNAs derived from orthologous genes of X. tropicalis and X. laevis, and found that the specific introns from which sisRNAs are derived are not conserved. The existence of sisRNAs in the cytoplasm of the oocyte, their transmission to the fertilized egg, and their persistence during early embryogenesis suggest that they might play a regulatory role in mRNA translation.

TI Transcriptome analysis around the onset of strawberry fruit ripening
   uncovers an important role of oxidative phosphorylation in ripening
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Although much progress has been made towards understanding the ripening of non-climacteric fruit using the strawberry as a model plant, the defined molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, RNA-sequencing was performed using four cDNA libraries around the onset of ripening, and a total of 31,793 unigenes and 335 pathways were annotated including the top five pathways, which were involved in ribosome, spliceosome, protein processing, plant-pathogen interaction and plant hormone signaling, and the important DEGs related to ripening were annotated to be mainly involved in protein translation and processing, sugar metabolism, energy metabolism, phytohormones, antioxidation, pigment and softening, especially finding a decreased trend of oxidative phosphorylation during red-coloring. VIGS-mediated downregulation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase gene PDHE1 alpha, a key gene for glycolysis-derived oxidative phosphorylation, could inhibit respiration and ATP biosynthesis, whilst promote the accumulation of sugar, ABA, ETH, and PA, ultimately accelerating the ripening. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that a set of metabolism transition occurred during green-to-white-to-red stages that are coupled with more-to-less DEGs, and the oxidative phosphorylation plays an important role in the regulation of ripening. On the basis of our results, we discuss an oxidative phosphorylation-based model underlying strawberry fruit ripening.

TI MicroRNA-542-3p inhibits tumour angiogenesis by targeting Angiopoietin-2
SO JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY
AB Angiopoietin-2 (Angpt2) plays a critical role in angiogenesis and tumour progression. Therapeutic targeting of Angpt2 has been implicated as a promising strategy for cancer treatment. Whereas miRNAs are emerging as important modulators of angiogenesis, regulation of Angpt2 by miRNAs has not been established. Here we firstly report that Ang2 is targeted by a microRNA, miRNA-542-3p, which inhibits tumour progression by impairing Ang2's pro-angiogenic activity. In cultured endothelial cells, miR-542-3p inhibited translation of Angpt2 mRNA by binding to its 3 ' UTR, and addition of miR-542-3p to cultured endothelial cells attenuated angiogenesis. Administration of miR-542-3p to tumour-bearing mice reduced tumour growth, angiogenesis and metastasis. Furthermore, the level of miR-542-3p in primary breast carcinomas correlated inversely with clinical progression in primary tumour samples from stage III and IV patients. Together, these findings uncover a novel regulatory pathway whereby an anti-angiogenic miR-542-3p directly targets the key angiogenesis-promoting protein Angpt2, suggesting that miR-542-3p may represent a promising target for anti-angiogenic therapy and a potential marker for monitoring disease progression.

TI Circulating MicroRNAs as a Tool for Diagnosis of Liver Disease
   Progression in People Living with HIV-1
SO VIRUSES-BASEL
AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by binding specific cell mRNA targets, preventing their translation. miRNAs are implicated in the regulation of important physiological and pathological pathways. Liver disease, including injury, fibrosis, metabolism dysregulation, and tumor development disrupts liver-associated miRNAs. In addition to their effect in the originating tissue, miRNAs can also circulate in body fluids. miRNA release is an important form of intercellular communication that plays a role in the physiological and pathological processes underlying multiple diseases. Circulating plasma levels of miRNAs have been identified as potential disease biomarkers. One of the main challenges clinics face is the lack of available noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosing and predicting the different stages of liver disease (e.g., nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis), particularly among individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Liver disease is a leading cause of death unrelated to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) among people living with HIV-1 (PLWH). Here, we review and discuss the utility of circulating miRNAs as biomarkers for early diagnosis, prognosis, and assessment of liver disease in PLWH. Remarkably, the identification of dysregulated miRNA expression may also identify targets for new therapeutics.

TI GAS5 Inhibits Gastric Cancer Cell Proliferation Partly by Modulating
   CDK6
SO ONCOLOGY RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
AB Introduction: As it is not clear whether growth arrest-specific 5 (GAS5) inhibits gastric cancer (GC) cell proliferation by regulating cell cycle, we analyzed the effect of GAS5 on cell cycle regulation of GC cells and explored the underlying mechanism. Methods: We measured GAS5 levels in GC tissues and corresponding normal tissues, and analyzed the role of GAS5 in regulation of cell proliferation and cell cycle in GC cells using CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry. We also measured the expression of P21 and CDK6 proteins after transfection of AGS and MGC-803 cells with pLJM-GAS5 and GAS5 siRNA, respectively, by western blotting. Results: GAS5 expression was significantly lower in GC tissues relative to normal tissues, and its lower expression was correlated with larger tumor size and a more advanced clinical stage of GC. GAS5 induced growth arrest of GC cells through inhibition of G1-S phase translation. The action of GAS5 may be mediated by upregulation of P21 and suppression of CDK6. Conclusion: These data enhance our understanding of the important role that GAS5 plays in the molecular etiology of GC and suggest a potential of GAS5 as a new therapeutic target for GC treatment.

TI MicroRNA-21a-5p regulates TGF-beta 1-induced myofibroblast
   transformation of rabbit keratocytes by targeting Smad7
SO SCIENCEASIA
AB The transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1)-induced transformation of keratocytes to myofibroblasts is a very common process during corneal wound healing, but a dysregulated TGF-beta 1 activity may induce unfavorable fibrosis and scar formation in the cornea. MicroRNA (miR)-21a-5p and Smad7 have been reported to play an important role in the fibrosis process. However, how miR-21a-5p involves in the TGF-beta 1-induced myofibroblasts transformation of keratocytes remains unclear. In the present study, we found an increase in the expressions of alpha-SMA and collagen I at protein level as well as Smad7 and miR-21a-5p at mRNA level when keratocytes were treated with TGF-beta 1Here; but the Smad7 at protein level kept unchanged. The overexpression of miR-21a-5p attenuated Smad7 protein expression, and miR-21a-5p inhibition promoted Smad7 protein expression without affecting its mRNA expression. Furthermore, inhibition of miR-21a-5p could decrease TGF-beta 1-induced alpha-SMA expression, whereas the addition of Smad7 knockdown would rescue the expression of alpha-SMA. These results suggested that miR-21a-5p had a promoting effect on TGF-beta 1induced myofibroblast transformation of keratocytes by targeting Smad7 at its translation stage.

TI Discovery of ANTAR-RNAs and their Mechanism of Action in Mycobacteria
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB Non-coding RNAs play pivotal roles in bacterial signaling. However, RNAs from certain phyla (specially high-GC actinobacteria) still remain elusive. Here, by re-engineering the existing genome-wide search approach, we discover a family of structurally conserved RNAs that are present ubiquitously across actinobacteria, including mycobacteria. In vitro analysis shows that RNAs belonging to this family bind response-regulator proteins that contain the widely prevalent ANTAR domain. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis ANTAR protein gets phosphorylated by a histidine kinase and interacts with RNA only in its phosphorylated state. These newly identified RNAs reside only in certain transcripts and typically overlap with the ribosome-binding site, regulating translation of these transcripts. In this way, the RNAs directly link signaling pathways to translational control, thus expanding the mechanistic tool kit available for ANTAR-based control of gene expression. In mycobacteria, we find that RNAs targeted by ANTAR proteins majorly encode enzymes of lipid metabolism and associated redox pathways. This now allows us to identify the key genes that mediate ANTAR-dependent control of lipid metabolism. Our study establishes the identity and wide prevalence of ANTAR-target RNAs in mycobacteria, bringing RNA-mediated regulation in these bacteria to the center stage. (C) 2020 The Authors.

TI Natural Language Processing in Oncology A Review
SO JAMA ONCOLOGY
AB IMPORTANCE Natural language processing (NLP) has the potential to accelerate translation of cancer treatments from the laboratory to the clinic and will be a powerful tool in the era of personalized medicine. This technology can harvest important clinical variables trapped in the free-text narratives within electronic medical records.
   OBSERVATIONS Natural language processing can be used as a tool for oncological evidence-based research and quality improvement. Oncologists interested in applying NLP for clinical research can play pivotal roles in building NLP systems and, in doing so, contribute to both oncological and clinical NLP research. Herein, we provide an introduction to NLP and its potential applications in oncology, a description of specific tools available, and a review on the state of the current technology with respect to cancer case identification, staging, and outcomes quantification.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE More automated means of leveraging unstructured data from daily clinical practice is crucial as therapeutic options and access to individual-level health information increase. Research-minded oncologists may push the avenues of evidence-based research by taking advantage of the new technologies available with clinical NLP. As continued progress is made with applying NLP toward oncological research, incremental gains will lead to large impacts, building a cost-effective infrastructure for advancing cancer care.

TI A feed-forward loop between nuclear translocation of CXCR4 and HIF-1
   alpha promotes renal cell carcinoma metastasis
SO ONCOGENE
AB CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) has been suggested to play a critical role in cancer metastasis. Some studies have described CXCR4 nuclear localization in metastatic lesions of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which has been suggested to be correlated with cancer metastasis. However, the underlying mechanism and clinical significance of CXCR4 nuclear localization remains unknown. Here, we show that CXCR4 nuclear localization is more likely to occur in RCC tissues, especially in metastases, and is associated with poor prognosis. CXCR4 nuclear localization requires its nuclear localization sequence (NLS, residues 146-RPRK-149). After the mutation of NLS in CXCR4, CXCR4 nuclear localization in RCC cells is lost. Nuclear localization of CXCR4 promoted RCC tumorigenicity both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that CXCR4 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) colocalized in RCC cells and interacted with each other. Moreover, CXCR4 nuclear localization promoted nuclear accumulation of HIF-1 alpha, thereby promoting the expression of genes downstream of HIF-1 alpha. Reciprocally, nuclear HIF-1 alpha promoted CXCR4 transcription, thus forming a feed-forward loop. Subcellular CXCR4 and HIF-1 alpha expression levels were independent adverse prognostic factors and could be combined with TNM stage to generate a predictive nomogram of the clinical outcome of patients with RCC. Therefore, our findings indicate that CXCR4 nuclear translocation plays a critical role in RCC metastasis and may serve as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target.

TI How Can We Improve Preventive and Educational Interventions for Intimate
   Relationships?
SO BEHAVIOR THERAPY
AB Improving intimate relationships with preventive and educational interventions has proven to be more difficult than originally conceived, and earlier models and approaches may be reaching their limits. Basic concerns remain about the long-term effectiveness of these interventions, whether they are reaching and benefiting couples most likely to need them, and how they might be exerting their effects. We identify six problems that we believe are hindering progress in the field, and for each we outline research findings that point to new ways forward. These problems include (a) the incomplete understanding of couple communication and unwarranted translation of communication findings into interventions; (b) the surprising stability of relationship satisfaction; (c) the powerful roles that personal histories, personalities, and stress play in determining relationship outcomes; (d) the difficulties involved in recruiting and retaining high-risk couples in intervention programs; (e) the lack of attention given to specific stages of relationship development in interventions; and (f) the tendency to deliver preventive and educational interventions in the same format as therapies for distressed couples. We conclude by noting that a large body of basic research about intimate relationships, and large-scale outcome research with diverse populations, hold great promise for advancing the field.

TI SpoIIID-mediated regulation of sigma(K) function during Clostridium
   difficile sporulation
SO MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY
AB The spore-forming bacterial pathogen Clostridium difficile is a leading cause of health-care-associated diarrhea worldwide. Although C.difficile spore formation is essential for disease transmission, the regulatory pathways that control this developmental process have only been partially characterized. In the well-studied spore-former Bacillus subtilis, the highly conserved sigma(E), SpoIIID and sigma(K) regulatory proteins control gene expression in the mother cell to ensure proper spore formation. To define the precise requirement for SpoIIID and sigma(K) during C.difficile sporulation, we analyzed spoIIID and sigK mutants using heterologous expression systems and RNA-Seq transcriptional profiling. These analyses revealed that expression of sigK from a SpoIIID-independent promoter largely bypasses the need for SpoIIID to produce heat-resistant spores. We also observed that sigma(K) is active upon translation, suggesting that SpoIIID primarily functions to activate sigK. SpoIIID nevertheless plays auxiliary roles during sporulation, as it enhances levels of the exosporium morphogenetic protein CdeC in a sigma(K)-dependent manner. Analyses of purified spores further revealed that SpoIIID and sigma(K) control the adherence of the CotB coat protein to C.difficile spores, indicating that these proteins regulate multiple stages of spore formation. Collectively, these results highlight that diverse mechanisms control spore formation in the Firmicutes.

TI Shakespeare, Authority and Hauntology: Postdramatic Performance in Walny
   Theatre's Hamlet
SO MULTICULTURAL SHAKESPEARE-TRANSLATION APPROPRIATION AND PERFORMANCE
AB The aim of this article is to explore the potential of hauntological theories to explain and problematise selected aspects of authority and performance in the context of Shakespeare's drama. Referring primarily to Derrida's and Abraham's concepts of the ghost and the phantom and their connection to Shakespeare's Hamlet, the article discusses hauntological perspectives on performance, both deconstructing and reaffirming authority. The paper comments on the relation between text and performance (Brook, Lehmann), memory and repetition (Carlson), disappearance and perpetual present (Phelan), as well as archive and repertoire (Taylor) in order to highlight the contradictory yet productive ways of understanding performance. The final part of the article, focusing on the significance of the ghost figure, examines experimental appropriations of Shakespeare's play in Walny Theatre's Hamlet (2015) in the light of postdramatic aesthetics.

TI Multiple functional involvement of Thymosin beta-4 in tooth germ
   development
SO HISTOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY
AB Thymosin beta-4 (T beta 4) is known to be ubiquitously involved in the actin monomer sequestering on the cytoskeleton. Our previous study showed specific temporal and special in situ expression pattern of T beta 4 mRNA in dental epithelial and mesenchymal cells in the developing tooth germ of the mouse lower first molar. In this study, we examined the functional implications of T beta 4 in the developmental course of the mouse lower first molar. An inhibition assay using T beta 4 antisense sulfur-substituted oligodeoxynucleotide (AS S-ODN) in cultured embryonic day 11.0 (E11.0) mandibles showed a significant growth inhibition of the tooth germ. However, no growth arrest of the cultured E15.0 tooth germ was observed by using T beta 4 AS S-ODN. The T beta 4 knockdown led to significantly decreased expression levels of type II/III runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and nucleolin (Ncl) in the cultured E11.0 mandibles. Since our previous studies proved that the inhibition of type II/III Runx2 and Ncl translations resulted in the developmental arrest of the tooth germ in the cultured E11.0 mandible, T beta 4 appears to play roles in tooth germ development via the regulation of the type II/III Runx2 and Ncl expressions. T beta 4 knockdown also resulted in decreased secretion of matrix metalloproteinase (Mmp)-2, a reduced cell motility activity and upregulation of E-cadherin in dental epithelial mDE6 cells. These results suggest that T beta 4 plays multiple functional roles in odontogenic epithelial cells in the early stages of tooth germ development by regulating the expression of odontogenesis-related genes.

TI Analysis of splice variants for the C. elegans orthologue of human
   neuroligin reveals a developmentally regulated transcript
SO GENE EXPRESSION PATTERNS
AB Neuroligins are synaptic adhesion molecules and important determinants of synaptic function. They are expressed at postsynaptic sites and involved in synaptic organization through key extracellular and intracellular protein interactions. They undergo trans-synaptic interaction with presynaptic neurexins. Distinct neuroligins use differences in their intracellular domains to selectively recruit synaptic scaffolds and this plays an important role in how they encode specialization of synaptic function. Several levels of regulation including gene expression, splicing, protein translation and processing regulate the expression of neuroligin function. We have used in silico and cDNA analyses to investigate the mRNA splicing of the Caenorhabditis elegans orthologue nlg-1. Transcript analysis highlights the potential for gene regulation with respect to both temporal expression and splicing. We found nlg-1 splice variants with all the predicted exons are a minor species relative to major splice variants lacking exons 13 and 14, or 14 alone. These major alternatively spliced variants change the intracellular domain of the gene product NLG-1. Interestingly, exon 14 encodes a cassette with two distinct potential functional domains. One is a polyproline SH3 binding domain and the other has homology to a region encoding the binding site for the scaffolding protein gephyrin in mammalian neuroligins. This suggests differential splicing impacts on NLG-1 competence to recruit intracellular binding partners. This may have developmental relevance as nlg-1 exon 14 containing transcripts are selectively expressed in L2-L3 larvae. These results highlight a developmental regulation of C. elegans nlg-1 that could play a key role in the assembly of synaptic protein complexes during the early stages of nervous system development.

TI Nicotiana benthamiana RanBP1-1 Is Involved in the Induction of Disease
   Resistance via Regulation of Nuclear-Cytoplasmic Transport of Small
   GTPase Ran
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB Plant cells enhance the tolerances to abiotic and biotic stresses via recognition of the stress, activation and nuclear import of signaling factors, up-regulation of defense genes, nuclear export of mRNA and translation of defense proteins. Nuclear pore-mediated transports should play critical roles in these processes, however, the regulatory mechanisms of nuclear-cytoplasmic transport during stress responses are largely unknown. In this study, a regulator of nuclear export of RNA and proteins, NbRanBP1-1 (Ran-binding protein1-1), was identified as an essential gene for the resistance of Nicotiana benthamiana to potato blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans. NbRanBP1-1-silenced plants showed delayed accumulation of capsidiol, a sesquiterpenoid phytoalexin, in response to elicitor treatment, and reduced resistance to P. infestans. Abnormal accumulation of mRNA was observed in NbRanBP1-1-silenced plants, indicating that NbRanBP1-1 is involved in the nuclear export of mRNA. In NbRanBP1-1-silenced plants, elicitor-induced expression of defense genes, NbEAS and NbWIPK, was not affected in the early stage of defense induction, but the accumulation of NbWIPK protein was reduced. Nuclear export of the small G-protein NbRan1a was activated during the induction of plant defense, whereas this process was compromised in NbRanBP1-1-silenced plants. Silencing of genes encoding the nuclear pore proteins, Nup75 and Nup160, also caused abnormal nuclear accumulation of mRNA, defects in the nuclear export of NbRan1a, and reduced production of capsidiol, resulting in decreased resistance to P. infestans. These results suggest that nuclear export of NbRan is a key event for defense induction in N. benthamiana, and both RanBP1-1 and nucleoporins play important roles in the process.

TI Introduction Shakespeare and/in Europe: Connecting Voices
SO MULTICULTURAL SHAKESPEARE-TRANSLATION APPROPRIATION AND PERFORMANCE
AB Recent Shakespearean productions, just like current European crises, have highlighted the exclusionary nature of European identity. In defining the scope of this special issue, the aim of this introduction is to shift the study of Shakespeare in/ and Europe away from the ideological field of "unity within diversity" and its attendant politics of negotiation and mediation. Instead, it investigates whether re-situating Shakespearean analysis within regimes of exclusionary politics and group conflict attitudes helps to generate dynamic cultural and social understandings. To what effect is Shakespeare's work invoked in relation with the tensions inherent in European societies? Can such invocations encourage reflections on Europe as a social, political and/ or cultural entity? Is it possible to conceptualize Shakespearean drama as offering an effective instrument that connects-or not-the voices of the people of Europe?

TI MicroRNA-31 Activates the RAS Pathway and Functions as an Oncogenic
   MicroRNA in Human Colorectal Cancer by Repressing RAS p21 GTPase
   Activating Protein 1 (RASA1)
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to play a vital role in colorectal cancer. We found a widespread disruption in miRNA expression during colorectal tumorigenesis using microarray and quantitative RT-PCR analysis; of the 161 miRNAs altered in colorectal cancer compared with normal adjacent tissue samples, miR-31 was the most significantly dysregulated. We identified candidate targets of miR-31 using bioinformatics approaches and validated RAS p21 GTPase activating protein 1 (RASA1) as a direct target. First, we found an inverse correlation between miR-31 and RASA1 protein levels in vivo. Second, in vitro evidence demonstrated that RASA1 expression was significantly decreased by treatment with pre-miR-31-LV, whereas anti-miR-31-LV treatment increased RASA1 protein levels. Third, a luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-31 directly recognizes a specific location within the 3'-untranslated region of RASA1 transcripts. Furthermore, the biological consequences of miR-31 targeting RASA1 were examined by the cell proliferation assay in vitro and by the immunodeficient mouse xenograft tumor model in vivo. Taken together, our results demonstrate for the first time that miR-31 plays a significant role in activating the RAS signaling pathway through the inhibition of RASA1 translation, thereby improving colorectal cancer cell growth and stimulating tumorigenesis.

TI Long non-coding RNA GAS6-AS1 acts as a ceRNA for microRNA-585, thereby
   increasing EIF5A2 expression and facilitating hepatocellular carcinoma
   oncogenicity
SO CELL CYCLE
AB Long non-coding RNA termed GAS6 antisense RNA 1 (GAS6-AS1) plays an essential role in gastric and non-small cell lung cancers. Nonetheless, the function of GAS6-AS1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been so far studied in detail. In this study, reverse-transcription quantitative PCR was performed to measure GAS6-AS1 expression in HCC samples. A series of functional experiments, including MTT assay, colony formation assay, flow-cytometric analysis, and transwell migration and invasion assays, was performed to determine the influence of GAS6-AS1 knockdown on the malignant phenotype of HCC. The results showed that GAS6-AS1 was significantly upregulated in HCC tissue samples and cell lines. Increased GAS6-AS1 expression was associated with tumor size, Edmondson grade, and Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) stage among patients with HCC. The overall survival of patients with HCC characterized with high expression of GAS6-AS1 was significantly shorter in comparison to that of patients with low level of GAS6-AS1. Functional experiments indicated that knockdown of GAS6-AS1 suppressed HCC cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion in vitro; promoted apoptosis in vitro; and decreased tumor growth in vivo. Of note, GAS6-AS1 was validated as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for microRNA-585 (miR-585) and consequently increased the expression of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A2 (EIF5A2). Finally, rescue experiments confirmed the association among GAS6-AS1, miR-585, and EIF5A2 in HCC cells. Our study provides substantial evidence that the GAS6-AS1/miR-585/EIF5A2 pathway plays an important role in HCC progression and that might be considered as a potential target for therapeutic approaches in HCC.

TI ORF4-protein deficient PCV2 mutants enhance virus-induced apoptosis and
   show differential expression of mRNAs in vitro
SO VIRUS RESEARCH
AB Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the essential infectious agent of PCV associated disease (PCVAD). During previous in vitro studies, 11 RNAs and four viral proteins have been detected in PCV2-infected cells. Open reading frame (ORF) 4 is 180 bp in length and has been identified at the transcription and the translation level. It overlaps completely with ORF3, which has a role in virus-induced apoptosis. In this study, start codon mutations (M1-PCV2) or in-frame termination mutations (M2-PCV2) were utilized to construct two ORF4-protein deficient viruses aiming to investigate its role in viral infection. The abilities of M1-PCV2 and M2-PCV2 to replicate, transcribe, express viral proteins, and to cause cellular apoptosis were evaluated. Viral DNA replication curves supported that the ORF4 protein is not essential for viral replication, but inhibits viral replication in the early stage of infection. Comparison of the expression level of ORF3 mRNA among wild-type and ORF4-deficient viruses in infected PK-15 cell demonstrated enhanced ORF3 transcription of both ORF4 mutants suggesting that the ORF4 protein may play an important role by restricting ORF3 transcription thereby preventing virus-induced apoptosis. This is further confirmed by the significantly higher caspase 3 and 8 activities in M1-PCV2 and M2-PCV2 compared to wild-type PCV2. Furthermore, the role of ORF4 in cell apoptosis and a possible interaction with the ORF1 associated Rep protein could perhaps explain the rapid viral growth in the early stage of infection and the higher expression level of ORF1 mRNA in ORF4 protein deficient PCV2 mutants.

TI Between the crisis of verse and the logic of prose : the genre of the
   French pastoral in prose (end of the 16th century-early romanticism)
SO ETUDES EPISTEME
AB The renewed interest in the pastoral genre is the occasion to focus on an understudied aspect of its tradition: the composition, in France, of narrative, dramatic and lyric pastorals written in prose. In light of the crisis of classical verse that many deemed impossible to amend, a certain number of writers resorted to prose so as to salvage poetry. In itself, the pastoral genre, whose naive aesthetics seemed to call for prose as its alleged natural material, provided the ideal chance to demonstrate the validity of this practice. As early as the 16th century, this genre became the favorite locus of the debate between verse and prose, the latter defeating the former. Already justified during the Baroque period by the existence of the pastoral novel - in prose, but purporting to be poetic - this aesthetics also developed, from the 17th century to the early Romantic age, in drama and lyricism through translations and original pieces as is illustrated by the vogue for idylls in prose inspired by Gessner in the second half of the 18th century. More specifically, new literary forms appeared, such as pastoral epics of biblical inspiration and new type of "pastoral novels" theorized by Florian, pieces in "poissard" style introduced by Vade, lyric "scenes" and "tableaux". However, under the French Revolution and Empire, the use of prose was to shed its role as savior of the poetic genre in order to develop its own threefold logic: triumph of the narrative novel, primacy of realism over imagination and death of the sense of poetry.

In this case, the CJEU ruled that a complex service that consists of offering interactive sessions of an erotic nature that are filmed and broadcast live on the Internet constitutes an 'entertainment activity' and must be considered as being physically carried out' within the meaning of Article 52(a) of the Value Added Tax (VAT) Directive (Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the Common System of Value Added Tax (with subsequent amendments), Of L 34711 (11 December 2006)) (as of 1 January 2011, Article 54(1) of the VAT Directive) in the place where the service provider has established his place of business. The decision in Geelen it remarkable in that it shows that even services such as those relating lo entertainment activities that, in the past, required the simultaneous physical presence of the supplier and the customer so that there was an obvious 'unity of action, time and place' (NL: Opinion Advocate General Szpunar, 12 February 2019, Case C-568/17, Geelen, ECLI:EU:C:2019:109, paragraph 17 (authors' unofficial translation), recalling the three 'Aristotelian' or 'classical' unites of drama) can now be provided from a distance so that this unity is eventually broken up and, hence, assessing VAT has become much less straightforward.

TI G-Quadruplex DNA Motifs in the Malaria Parasite Plasmodium falciparum
   and Their Potential as Novel Antimalarial Drug Targets
SO ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY
AB G-quadruplexes are DNA or RNA secondary structures that can be formed from guanine-rich nucleic acids. These four-stranded structures, composed of stacked quartets of guanine bases, can be highly stable and have been demonstrated to occur in vivo in the DNA of human cells and other systems, where they play important biological roles, influencing processes such as telomere maintenance, DNA replication and transcription, or, in the case of RNA G-quadruplexes, RNA translation and processing. We report for the first time that DNA G-quadruplexes can be detected in the nuclei of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, which has one of the most A/T-biased genomes sequenced and therefore possesses few guaninerich sequences with the potential to form G-quadruplexes. We show that despite this paucity of putative G-quadruplex-forming sequences, P. falciparum parasites are sensitive to several G-quadruplex-stabilizing drugs, including quarfloxin, which previously reached phase 2 clinical trials as an anticancer drug. Quarfloxin has a rapid initial rate of kill and is active against ring stages as well as replicative stages of intra-erythrocytic development. We show that several G-quadruplex-stabilizing drugs, including quarfloxin, can suppress the transcription of a G-quadruplex-containing reporter gene in P. falciparum but that quarfloxin does not appear to disrupt the transcription of rRNAs, which was proposed as its mode of action in both human cells and trypanosomes. These data suggest that quarfloxin has potential for repositioning as an antimalarial with a novel mode of action. Furthermore, G-quadruplex biology in P. falciparum may present a target for development of other new antimalarial drugs.

TI Ribosome Reconstruction during Recovery from
   High-Hydrostatic-Pressure-Induced Injury in Bacillus subtilis
SO APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB Vegetative cells of Bacillus subtilis can recover from injury after high-hydrostatic-pressure (HHP) treatment at 250 MPa. DNA microarray analysis revealed that substantial numbers of ribosomal genes and translation-related genes (e.g., translation initiation factors) were upregulated during the growth arrest phase after HHP treatment. The transcript levels of cold shock-responsive genes, whose products play key roles in efficient translation, and heat shock-responsive genes, whose products mediate correct protein folding or degrade misfolded proteins, were also upregulated. In contrast, the transcript level of hpf, whose product (Hpf) is involved in ribosome inactivation through the dimerization of 70S ribosomes, was downregulated during the growth arrest phase. Sucrose density gradient sedimentation analysis revealed that ribosomes were dissociated in a pressure-dependent manner and then reconstructed. We also found that cell growth after HHP-induced injury was apparently inhibited by the addition of Mn2+ or Zn2+ to the recovery medium. Ribosome reconstruction in the HHP-injured cells was also significantly delayed in the presence of Mn2+ or Zn2+. Moreover, Zn2+, but not Mn2+, promoted dimer formation of 70S ribosomes in the HHP-injured cells. Disruption of the hpf gene suppressed the Zn2+-dependent accumulation of ribosome dimers, partially relieving the inhibitory effect of Zn2+ on the growth recovery of HHP-treated cells. In contrast, it was likely that Mn2+ prevented ribosome reconstruction without stimulating ribosome dimerization. Our results suggested that both Mn2+ and Zn2+ can prevent ribosome reconstruction, thereby delaying the growth recovery of HHP-injured B. subtilis cells.
   IMPORTANCE HHP treatment is used as a nonthermal processing technology in the food industry to inactivate bacteria while retaining high quality of foods under suppressed chemical reactions. However, some populations of bacterial cells may survive the inactivation. Although the survivors are in a transient nongrowing state due to HHP-induced injury, they can recover from the injury and then start growing, depending on the postprocessing conditions. The recovery process in terms of cellular components after the injury remains unclear. Transcriptome analysis using vegetative cells of Bacillus subtilis revealed that the translational machinery can preferentially be reconstructed after HHP treatment. We found that both Mn2+ and Zn2+ prolonged the growth-arrested stage of HHP-injured cells by delaying ribosome reconstruction. It is likely that ribosome reconstruction is crucial for the recovery of growth ability in HHP-injured cells. This study provides further understanding of the recovery process in HHP-injured B. subtilis cells.

TI High methionyl-tRNA synthetase expression predicts poor prognosis in
   patients with breast cancer
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PATHOLOGY
AB Aims
   Methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MARS) is known to play a critical role in initiating translation and protection against cellular damages in vivo. The aim of this study was to clarify the role of MARS in breast cancer (BC) progression.
   Methods
   The expressions of MARS messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein in human BC tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues were detected by quantitative real-time PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry. The prognostic potential of MARS in patients with BC was assessed by univariate and multivariate survival analyses. The association between the MARS expression and BC progression was further evaluated by the bioinformatics database of UALCAN, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) and Gene Expression Database of Normal and Tumor Tissues (GENT). The role of MARS in the proliferation, migration and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7 cells) was investigated after siRNA transfection.
   Results
   The expression level of MARS mRNA in the fresh BC tissues was significantly higher than that in the adjacent tissues. Immunohistochemistry showed that the expression level of MARS was closely associated with the clinicopathologial parameters of patients with BC, including the HER-2 status, Ki-67 status, molecular classification, tumour grade, N stage and tumour, node, metastasis (TNM) stage, and this finding was further confirmed by UALCAN database. The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that high MARS expression and TNM stage were predictors of poor prognosis of patients with BC. The proliferation, migration and EMT capabilities of MCF-7 cells were significantly suppressed after MARS knockdown. An overview of UALCAN, GEPIA and GENT results suggested that MARS may be an oncogene of BC, as well as a potential therapeutic target of this malignant tumour.
   Conclusions
   High expression level of MARS in the human BC tissues was significantly associated with the unfavourable prognosis of patients with BC, suggesting that MARS may serve as a potential prognostic marker for the clinical diagnosis and prognostic prediction of BC.

TI From bench to FDA to bedside: US regulatory trends for new stem cell
   therapies
SO ADVANCED DRUG DELIVERY REVIEWS
AB The phrase "bench-to-bedside" is commonly used to describe the translation of basic discoveries such as those on stem cells to the clinic for therapeutic use in human patients. However, there is a key intermediate step in between the bench and the bedside involving governmental regulatory oversight such as by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States (US). Thus, it might be more accurate in most cases to describe the stem cell biological drug development process in this way: from bench to FDA to bedside. The intermediate development and regulatory stage for stem cell-based biological drugs is a multifactorial, continually evolving part of the process of developing a biological drug such as a stem cell-based regenerative medicine product. In some situations, stem cell-related products may not be classified as biological drugs in which case the FDA plays a relatively minor role. However, this middle stage is generally a major element of the process and is often colloquially referred to in an ominous way as "The Valley of Death". This moniker seems appropriate because it is at this point, and in particular in the work that ensues after Phase 1, clinical trials that most drug product development is terminated, often due to lack of funding, diseases being refractory to treatment, or regulatory issues. Not surprisingly, workarounds to deal with or entirely avoid this difficult stage of the process are evolving both inside and outside the domains of official regulatory authorities. In some cases these efforts involve the FDA invoking new mechanisms of accelerating the bench to beside process, but in other cases these new pathways bypass the FDA in part or entirely. Together these rapidly changing stem cell product development and regulatory pathways raise many scientific, ethical, and medical questions. These emerging trends and their potential consequences are reviewed here. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Protein misfolding, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and guanabenz:
   protocol for a phase II RCT with futility design (ProMISe trial)
SO BMJ OPEN
AB Introduction Recent studies suggest that endoplasmic reticulum stress may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) through an altered regulation of the proteostasis, the cellular pathway-balancing protein synthesis and degradation. A key mechanism is thought to be the dephosphorylation of eIF2 alpha, a factor involved in the initiation of protein translation. Guanabenz is an alpha-2-adrenergic receptor agonist safely used in past to treat mild hypertension and is now an orphan drug. A pharmacological action recently discovered is its ability to modulate the synthesis of proteins by the activation of translational factors preventing misfolded protein accumulation and endoplasmic reticulum overload. Guanabenz proved to rescue motoneurons from misfolding protein stress both in in vitro and in vivo ALS models, making it a potential disease-modifying drug in patients. It is conceivable investigating whether its neuroprotective effects based on the inhibition of eIF2 alpha dephosphorylation can change the progression of ALS.
   Methods and analyses Protocolised Management In Sepsis is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial with futility design. We will investigate clinical outcomes, safety, tolerability and biomarkers of neurodegeneration in patients with ALS treated with guanabenz or riluzole alone for 6 months. The primary aim is to test if guanabenz can reduce the proportion of patients progressed to a higher stage of disease at 6 months compared with their baseline stage as measured by the ALS Milano-Torino Staging (ALS-MITOS) system and to the placebo group. Secondary aims are safety, tolerability and change in at least one biomarker of neurodegeneration in the guanabenz arm compared with the placebo group. Findings will provide reliable data on the likelihood that guanabenz can slow the course of ALS in a phase III trial.
   Ethics and dissemination The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of IRCCS 'Carlo Besta Foundation' of Milan (Eudract no. 2014-005367-32 Preresults) based on the Helsinki declaration.

TI Shakespeare in Digital Games and Virtual Worlds
SO MULTICULTURAL SHAKESPEARE-TRANSLATION APPROPRIATION AND PERFORMANCE
AB Shakespeare's plays have long flirted with using various artistic and medial forms other than theatre, such as cinema, music, visual arts, television, comics, animation and, lately, digital games and virtual worlds. Especially in the 20th and 21st century, a fascination with Shakespeare both as a historical and theatrical figure and as a playwright has become evident in screen based media (cinema, television and video), ranging from "faithful," almost documented performances of his plays to free style adaptations or vague film references. Digital games and virtual worlds carry on this tradition of the transmedial journey of Shakespeare's plays to screen based media but top it up with new forms of interaction and performativity. For the first time in the history of mankind everyone can enjoy firsthand from his armchair and for free the experience of taking part in a play by the Bard by entering a virtual world as if it was a stage and by assuming roles through avatars.
   The article attempts first to introduce the reader to the deeper needs that gave rise to animation, a fundamental aspect of digital gaming and virtual worlds. It then tries to illuminate the various facets of digital performance and gaming, especially in relation to Shakespeare-themed and inspired digital games and virtual worlds, by putting forward some axes of classification. Finally, it both suggests some ideas that may be of use in rendering the Shakespeare gaming experience more "complete" and "theatrical" and ends by acknowledging the immense potential for the exploration of theatricality and performativity in digital games and virtual worlds.

TI Exploring the Benefit of 2-Methylbutyric Acid in Patients Undergoing
   Hemodialysis Using a Cardiovascular Proteomics Approach
SO NUTRIENTS
AB Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) can reduce pro-inflammatory parameters and oxidative stress, providing potential cardiovascular (CV) benefits. Although some evidence links SCFAs with host metabolic health via several biological mechanisms, the role of SCFA on CV disease in patients with kidney disease remains unclear. Herein, we investigate the association between a SCFA, 2-methylbutyric acid, and target CV proteomics to explore the potential pathophysiology of SCFA-related CV benefit in patients with kidney disease. Circulating 2-methylbutyric acid was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography and 181 CV proteins by a proximity extension assay in 163 patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD). The associations between 2-methylbutyric acid and CV proteins were evaluated using linear regression analysis with age and gender, and multiple testing adjustment. The selected CV protein in the discovery phase was further confirmed in multivariable-adjusted models and evaluated by continuous scale association. The mean value of circulating 2-methylbutyric acid was 0.22 +/- 0.02 mu m which was negatively associated with bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP-6) according to the false discovery rate (FDR) multiple testing adjustment method. The 2-methylbutyric acid level remained negatively associated with BMP-6 (beta coefficient -1.00, 95% confidence interval -1.45 to -0.55, p < 0.001) after controlling for other CV risk factors in multivariable models. The cubic spline curve demonstrated a linear relationship. In conclusion, circulating 2-methylbutyric acid level was negatively associated with BMP-6, suggesting that this pathway maybe involved in vascular health in patients undergoing HD. However, further in vitro work is still needed to validate the translation of the mechanistic pathways.

TI The Interlanguage Pragmatics of Japanese Daily Greetings by Malaysian
   Learners
SO GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES
AB Scholars in pragmatics argue that the teaching of a second language (L2) must pay extra attention to the language forms and expressions within specific cultural contexts. Not being able to use a L2 according to the nature of its cultural context could sometimes lead to misunderstanding and miscommunication. This study aims to explain the interlanguage pragmatic transfer in daily greetings used by Malaysian learners of Japanese. Using a convenient sampling technique, the respondents are 80 Malay students enrolling in a Japanese preparatory program prior to attending Japanese universities. Being competent in using Japanese language in context is therefore crucial for them. This study employs a qualitative research approach using Discourse Completion Tests (DCT) and follow-up interviews. Shleykina' s model of greetings is appropriated and used as the framework which allows data to be categorized into six patterns. The findings show that Malaysian learners chose to use less greetings when they greet their Japanese friends vis-a-vis their Malaysian friends. The types of Japanese greetings they use are mostly greeting expressions from what they have learned in the classrooms. Other casual greetings applied are learned from anime, dramas and Japanese TV programs. This study revealed that some of the Japanese greetings used are actually a direct translation from Bahasa Melayu. This pragmatic transfer has offered two perspectives, which are, success transfer and failure transfer. The results contribute towards the importance of exposure to and the understanding of the cultural context of a target language in choosing appropriate greetings among L2 in interlanguage context.

TI Adhesion to E-selectin primes macrophages for activation through AKT and
   mTOR
SO IMMUNOLOGY AND CELL BIOLOGY
AB The endothelial adhesion protein E-selectin/CD62E is not required for leukocyte homing, unlike closely related family member P-selectin/CD62P. As transmigration through the endothelium is one of the first steps in generating a local immune response, we hypothesized that E-selectin may play additional roles in the early stages of immune activation. We found contact with E-selectin, but not P-selectin or vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (CD106), induced phosphorylation of protein kinase B (AKT) and nuclear factor-kappa B in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) in vitro. This occurred within 15 min of E-selectin contact and was dependent on phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase activity. Binding to E-selectin activated downstream proteins including mammalian target of rapamycin, p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1. Functionally, adhesion to E-selectin induced upregulation of CD86 expression and CCL2 secretion. We next asked whether contact with E-selectin impacts further BMDM stimulation. We found enhanced secretion of both interleukin (IL)-10 and CCL2, but not tumor necrosis factor or IL-6 in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation after adhesion to E-selectin. Importantly, adhesion to E-selectin did not polarize BMDMs to one type of response but enhanced both arginase activity and nitric oxide production following IL-4 or LPS stimulation, respectively. In cultured human monocytes, adhesion to E-selectin similarly induced phosphorylation of AKT. Finally, when E-selectin was blocked in vivo in mice, thioglycollate-elicited macrophages showed reduced CD86 expression, validating our in vitro studies. Our results imply functions for E-selectin beyond homing and suggest that E-selectin plays an early role in priming and amplifying innate immune responses.

TI The cellular localization and redistribution of multiple aquaporin
   paralogs in the spermatic duct epithelium of a maturing marine teleost
SO JOURNAL OF ANATOMY
AB Aquaporin-mediated fluid transport in the mammalian efferent duct and epididymis is believed to play a role in sperm maturation and concentration. In fish, such as the marine teleost gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata), the control of fluid homeostasis in the spermatic duct seems also to be crucial for male fertility, but no information exists on the expression and distribution of aquaporins. In this study, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting analyses, employing available and newly raised paralog-specific antibodies for seabream aquaporins, indicate that up to nine functional aquaporins, Aqp0a, -1aa, -1ab, -3a, -4a, -7, -8bb, -9b and -10b, are expressed in the spermatic duct. Immunolocalization of the channels in the resting spermatic duct reveals that Aqp0a, -1aa, -4a, -7 and -10b are expressed in the monolayered luminal epithelium, Aqp8b and -9b in smooth muscle fibers, and Aqp1ab and -3a in different interstitial lamina cells. In the epithelial cells, Aqp0a and -1aa are localized in the short apical microvilli, and Aqp4a and -10b show apical and basolateral staining, whereas Aqp7 is solely detected in vesicular compartments. Upon spermiation, an elongation of the epithelial cells sterocilia, as well as the folding of the epithelium, is observed. At this stage, single- and double-immunostaining, using two aquaporin paralogs or the Na+/K+-ATPase membrane marker, indicate that Aqp1ab, -3a, -7, -8bb and -9b staining remains unchanged, whereas in epithelial cells Aqp1aa translation is supressed, Aqp4a internalizes, and Aqp0a and -10b accumulate in the apical, lateral and basal plasma membrane. These findings uncover a cell type- and region-specific distribution of multiple aquaporins in the piscine spermatic duct, which shares conserved features of the mammalian system. The data therefore suggest that aquaporins may play different roles in the regulation of fluid homeostasis and sperm maturation in the male reproductive tract of fish.

TI The Deoptimization of Rabies Virus Matrix Protein Impacts Viral
   Transcription and Replication
SO VIRUSES-BASEL
AB Rabies virus (RABV) matrix (M) protein plays several important roles during RABV infection. Although previous studies have assessed the functions of M through gene rearrangements, this interferes with the position of other viral proteins. In this study, we attenuated M expression through deoptimizing its codon usage based on codon pair bias in RABV. This strategy more objectively clarifies the role of M during virus infection. Codon-deoptimized M inhibited RABV replication during the early stages of infection, but enhanced viral titers at later stages. Codon-deoptimized M also inhibited genome synthesis at early stage of infection and increased the RABV transcription rates. Attenuated M through codon deoptimization enhanced RABV glycoprotein expression following RABV infection in neuronal cells, but had no influence on the cell-to-cell spread of RABV. In addition, codon-deoptimized M virus induced higher levels of apoptosis compared to the parental RABV. These results indicate that codon-deoptimized M increases glycoprotein expression, providing a foundation for further investigation of the role of M during RABV infection.

TI The role of enriched environment in neural development and repair
SO FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE
AB In addition to genetic information, environmental factors play an important role in the structure and function of nervous system and the occurrence and development of some nervous system diseases. Enriched environment (EE) can not only promote normal neural development through enhancing neuroplasticity but also play a nerve repair role in restoring functional activities during CNS injury by morphological and cellular and molecular adaptations in the brain. Different stages of development after birth respond to the environment to varying degrees. Therefore, we systematically review the pro-developmental and anti-stress value of EE during pregnancy, pre-weaning, and "adolescence" and analyze the difference in the effects of EE and its sub-components, especially with physical exercise. In our exploration of potential mechanisms that promote neurodevelopment, we have found that not all sub-components exert maximum value throughout the developmental phase, such as animals that do not respond to physical activity before weaning, and that EE is not superior to its sub-components in all respects. EE affects the developing and adult brain, resulting in some neuroplastic changes in the microscopic and macroscopic anatomy, finally contributing to enhanced learning and memory capacity. These positive promoting influences are particularly prominent regarding neural repair after neurobiological disorders. Taking cerebral ischemia as an example, we analyzed the molecular mediators of EE promoting repair from various dimensions. We found that EE does not always lead to positive effects on nerve repair, such as infarct size. In view of the classic issues such as standardization and relativity of EE have been thoroughly discussed, we finally focus on analyzing the essentiality of the time window of EE action and clinical translation in order to devote to the future research direction of EE and rapid and reasonable clinical application.

TI Suppression of Zika Virus Infection and Replication in Endothelial Cells
   and Astrocytes by PKA Inhibitor PKI 14-22
SO JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
AB The recent outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV), a reemerging flavivirus, and its associated neurological disorders, such as Guillain-Barre (GB) syndrome and microcephaly, have generated an urgent need to develop effective ZIKV vaccines and therapeutic agents. Here, we used human endothelial cells and astrocytes, both of which represent key cell types for ZIKV infection, to identify potential inhibitors of ZIKV replication. Because several pathways, including the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), protein kinase A (PKA), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways, have been reported to play important roles in flavivirus replication, we tested inhibitors and agonists of these pathways for their effects on ZIKV replication. We identified the PKA inhibitor PKI 14-22 (PKI) to be a potent inhibitor of ZIKV replication. PKI effectively suppressed the replication of ZIKV from both the African and Asian/ American lineages with a high efficiency and minimal cytotoxicity. While ZIKV infection does not induce PKA activation, endogenous PKA activity is essential for supporting ZIKV replication. Interestingly, in addition to PKA, PKI also inhibited another unknown target(s) to block ZIKV replication. PKI inhibited ZIKV replication at the postentry stage by preferentially affecting negative-sense RNA synthesis as well as viral protein translation. Together, these results have identified a potential inhibitor of ZIKV replication which could be further explored for future therapeutic application.
   IMPORTANCE There is an urgent need to develop effective vaccines and therapeutic agents against Zika virus (ZIKV) infection, a reemerging flavivirus associated with neurological disorders, including Guillain-Barre (GB) syndrome and microcephaly. By screening for inhibitors of several cellular pathways, we have identified the PKA inhibitor PKI 14-22 (PKI) to be a potent inhibitor of ZIKV replication. We show that PKI effectively suppresses the replication of all ZIKV strains tested with minimal cytotoxicity to human endothelial cells and astrocytes, two key cell types for ZIKV infection. Furthermore, we show that PKI inhibits ZIKV negative-sense RNA synthesis and viral protein translation. This study has identified a potent inhibitor of ZIKV infection which could be further explored for future therapeutic application.

TI OsSLC1 Encodes a Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein Essential for Early
   Chloroplast Development and Seedling Survival
SO RICE
AB Background The large family of pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins is widely distributed among land plants. Such proteins play vital roles in intron splicing, RNA editing, RNA processing, RNA stability and RNA translation. However, only a small number of PPR genes have been identified in rice. Results In this study, we raised a mutant from tissue-culture-derived plants of Oryza sativa subsp. japonica 'Zhonghua 11', which exhibited a lethal chlorosis phenotype from germination to the third-leaf stage. The mutant was designated seedling-lethal chlorosis 1 (slc1). The slc1 mutant leaves showed extremely low contents of photosynthetic pigments and abnormal chloroplast development, and were severely defective in photosynthesis. Map-based cloning of OsSLC1 revealed that a single base (G) deletion was detected in the first exon of Os06g0710800 in the slc1 mutant, which caused a premature stop codon. Knockout and complementation experiments further confirmed that OsSLC1 is responsible for the seedling-lethal chlorosis phenotype in the slc1 mutant. OsSLC1 was preferentially expressed in green leaves, and encoded a chloroplast-localized PPR protein harboring 12 PPR motifs. Loss-of-function of OsSLC1 affected the intron splicing of multiple group II introns, and especially precluded the intron splicing of rps16, and resulted in significant increase in the transcript levels of 3 chloroplast ribosomal RNAs and 16 chloroplast development-related and photosynthesis-related genes, and in significant reduction in the transcript levels of 1 chloroplast ribosomal RNAs and 2 chloroplast development-related and photosynthesis-related genes. Conclusion We characterized a novel chloroplast-localized PPR protein, OsSLC1, which plays a vital role in the intron splicing of multiple group II introns, especially the rps16 intron, and is essential for early chloroplast development and seedling survival in rice.

TI How Viral Poems are Annotated On 'OCD' by Neil Hilborn
SO PERFORMANCE RESEARCH
AB In How Viral Poems are Annotated: On OCD' by Neil Hilborn Kila van der Starre explores how, where and by whom viral poems are annotated. The article focuses on the performance of the poem OCD' by Neil Hilborn that went viral in the summer of 2013 and has been viewed more than 10 million times on YouTube. Researching online poetry performances and annotations can be seen as a new type of literary reception study in the digital age. It shows that poetry in the twenty-first century is a widespread, actively experienced and annotated, transmedia genre in what Henry Jenkins calls convergence culture' (Jenkins 2006: 2).The performance of OCD' triggered a broad array of reactions, including oral, written, creative, analytical, applauding and critical annotations. The video received more than 9,000 comments on YouTube from 130 countries and the poem was translated into at least thirteen languages. People used self-made films with actors, drawings, stop-motion techniques, footage montage and voice-overs to produce adaptations of the poem. Probably the most common annotation to the performance is a video in which a cover' performance of the poem is recorded; on stage for a live audience, in the original language or in translation, in the US, France, Germany, Servia and more.The way that Hilborn's poem is transcribed, translated, adapted, remade, remixed and analysed gives us insight into how people experience and understand poetry. Also, the ways in which online and offline annotations coincide give an alternative view on the idea that print and digital media are separate tracks that do not interact. By focusing on different types of annotations Van der Starre explores the ways in which active participants are making meaning' of the performance. The article shows how emotion, identification, translation, genre, authenticity, analysis and interpretation play a role in the way that people experience and understand the poem.

TI microRNA-31 modulates skeletal patterning in the sea urchin embryo
SO DEVELOPMENT
AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that repress the translation and reduce the stability of target mRNAs in animal cells. microRNA-31 (miR-31) is known to play a role in cancer, bone formation and lymphatic development. However, studies to understand the function of miR-31 in embryogenesis have been limited. We examined the regulatory role of miR-31 in early development using the sea urchin as a model. miR-31 is expressed at all stages of development and its knockdown (KD) disrupts the patterning and function of primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs), which form the embryonic skeleton spicules. We identified that miR-31 directly represses Pmar1, Alx1, Snail and VegfR7 within the PMC gene regulatory network using reporter constructs. Further, blocking the miR-31-mediated repression of Alx1 and/or VegfR7 in the developing embryo resulted in defects in PMC patterning and skeletogenesis. The majority of the mislocalized PMCs in miR-31 KD embryos did not express VegfR10, indicating that miR-31 regulates VegfR gene expression within PMCs. In addition, miR-31 indirectly suppresses Vegf3 expression in the ectoderm. These results indicate that miR-31 coordinately suppresses genes within the PMCs and in the ectoderm to impact PMC patterning and skeletogenesis. This study identifies the novel function and molecular mechanism of miR-31-mediated regulation in the developing embryo.

TI Identification of PKP 2/3 as potential biomarkers of ovarian cancer
   based on bioinformatics and experiments
SO CANCER CELL INTERNATIONAL
AB Background Plakophilins (PKPs) are widely involved in gene transcription, translation, and signal transduction, playing a crucial role in tumorigenesis and progression. However, the function and potential mechanism of PKP1/2/3 in ovarian cancer (OC) remains unclear. It's of great value to explore the expression and prognostic values of PKP1/2/3 and their potential mechanisms, immune infiltration in OC. Methods The expression levels, prognostic values and genetic variations of PKP1/2/3 in OC were explored by various bioinformatics tools and databases, and PKP2/3 were selected for further analyzing their regulation network and immune infiltration. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways (KEGG) enrichment were also conducted. Finally, the expression and prognosis of PKP2 were validated by immunohistochemistry. Results The expression level and prognosis of PKP1 showed little significance in ovarian cancer, and the expression of PKP2/3 mRNA and protein were upregulated in OC, showing significant correlations with poor prognosis of OC. Functional enrichment analysis showed that PKP2/3 and their correlated genes were significantly enriched in adaptive immune response, cytokine receptor activity, organization of cell-cell junction and extracellular matrix; KEGG analysis showed that PKP2/3 and their significantly correlated genes were involved in signaling pathways including cytokine-mediated signaling pathway, receptor signaling pathway and pathways in cancer. Moreover, PKP2/3 were correlated with lymphocytes and immunomodulators. We confirmed that high expression of PKP2 was significantly associated with advanced stage, poor differentiation and poor prognosis of OC patients. Conclusion Members of plakophilins family showed various degrees of abnormal expressions and prognostic values in ovarian cancer. PKP2/3 played crucial roles in tumorigenesis, aggressiveness, malignant biological behavior and immune infiltration of OC, and can be regarded as potential biomarker for early diagnosis and prognosis evaluation in OC.

TI Unraveling galectin-1 as a novel therapeutic target for cancer
SO CANCER TREATMENT REVIEWS
AB Galectins belong to a family of carbohydrate-binding proteins with an affinity for beta-galactosides. Galectin-1 is differentially expressed by various normal and pathologic tissues and displays a wide range of biological activities. In oncology, galectin-1 plays a pivotal role in tumor growth and in the multistep process of invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Evidence indicates that galectin-1 exerts a variety of functions at different steps of tumor progression. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that galectin-1 cellular localization and galectin-1 binding partners depend on tumor localization and stage. Recently, galectin-1 overexpression has been extensively documented in several tumor types and/or in the stroma of cancer cells. Its expression is thought to reflect tumor aggressiveness in several tumor types. Galectin-1 has been identified as a promising drug target using synthetic and natural inhibitors. Preclinical data suggest that galectin-1 inhibition may lead to direct antiproliferative effects in cancer cells as well as antiangiogenic effects in tumors. We provide an up-to-date overview of available data on the role of galectin-1 in different molecular and biochemical pathways involved in human malignancies. One of the major challenges faced in targeting galectin-1 is the translation of current knowledge into the design and development of effective galectin-1 inhibitors in cancer therapy.

TI Defects in MAP1S-mediated autophagy cause reduction in mouse lifespans
   especially when fibronectin is overexpressed
SO AGING CELL
AB Autophagy is a cellular process that executes the turnover of dysfunctional organelles and misfolded or abnormally aggregated proteins. Microtubule-associated protein MAP1S interacts with autophagy marker LC3 and positively regulates autophagy flux. LC3 binds with fibronectinmRNA and facilitates its translation. The synthesized fibronectin protein is exported to cell surface to initiate the assembly of fibronectin extracellular matrix. Fibronectin is degraded in lysosomes after it is engulfed into cytosol via endocytosis. Here, we show that defects in MAP1S-mediated autophagy trigger oxidative stress, sinusoidal dilation, and lifespan reduction. Overexpression of LC3 in wild-type mice increases the levels of fibronectin and -H(2)AX, a marker of DNA double-strand breakage. LC3-induced fibronectin is efficiently degraded in lysosomes to maintain a balance of fibronectin levels in wild-type mice so that the mice live a normal term of lifespan. In the LC3 transgenic mice with MAP1S deleted, LC3 enhances the synthesis of fibronectin but the MAP1S depletion causes an impairment of the lysosomal degradation of fibronectin. The accumulation of fibronectin protein promotes liver fibrosis, induces an accumulation of cell population at the G0/G1 stage, and further intensifies oxidative stress and sinusoidal dilatation. The LC3-induced overexpression of fibronectin imposes stresses on MAP1S-deficient mice and dramatically reduces their lifespans. Therefore, MAP1S-mediated autophagy plays an important role in maintaining mouse lifespan especially in the presence of extra amount of fibronectin.

TI Who's There? Shakespeare in Production as Heterotopia in France
SO ROMANCE STUDIES
AB By virtue of the increasing spatial networks in which it is performed, contemporary Shakespeare is globalized and cosmopolitan and seems to function as a timeless non-place. However, at the local level, cultural encounters with Shakespeare also allegedly introduce dissonant voices that destabilize dominant readings of the plays. This article analyses the Shakespearian productions of four contemporary French directors within the context of a culture of alternate ordering that aims to carve out social and cultural space as a space of difference and hybridity. It firstly suggests a reading of the version of Hamlet that Daniel Mesguich staged in 1996 based on his problematization of spatial practice and representation. The techniques of displacement the production entailed created double effects and affected translation to the extent that the play became associated with the Otherness of space and time. In another theatrical register illustrated by some of the smaller companies working outside of large theatrical institutions, the productions of directors Michel Laubu (1996-97), Jean-Luc Courcoult (200306), and Michel Cailleau (2003-to date) further dislocate the Shakespearian text, to recycle it with heterogeneous everyday objects and integrate it into the life of the city. In these productions the heterogeneization of Shakespeare collapses space and time together, and unsettles order and hierarchies. Shakespeare is reterritorialized into counter-sites of difference which are neither French, English, nor Shakespearian spaces, asking what meanings are created when Shakespeare is produced in another culture and language. In these productions the understanding of Shakespeare may be affected by textual disruption and the undermining of interpretative certainties. Dislocation undermines the logic of meaning and gives access to a polysemic theatre which presents the shared Shakespearian memory as a problematic cultural space.

TI Overexpression of EIF5A2 correlates with tumor progression and predicts
   poor prognosis in cervical cancer
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PATHOLOGY
AB Background: Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A2 (EIF5A2) has been demonstrated to play important roles in tumor progression. However, the role of EIF5A2 in cervical cancer remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the expression and clinicopathological significance of EIF5A2 in cervical cancer. Methods: The mRNA expression level of EIF5A2 was analyzed in 10 pairs of cervical cancer and adjacent non-cancerous tissues by semi-quantitative real time-PCR assay. Immunohistochemistry was performed to assess EIF5A2 protein expression in 124 paraffin-embedded, archived cervical cancer samples. Survival analysis and Cox regression analysis were performed to investigate the clinicopathological significance of EIF5A2 expression. Results: Our data revealed that EIF5A2 was frequently overexpressed in cervical cancer tissues compared to normal adjacent noncancerous cervical tissues. Moreover, high expression of EIF5A2 in is strongly associated with advanced FIGO stage (P=0.005) and parametrial invasion (P=0.041). Cervical cancer patients with higher Parametrial invasion expression had substantially shorter overall (P=0.038) and recurrence-free (P<0.001) survival times than patients with lower parametrial invasion expression. Multivariate analysis revealed that parametrial invasion might be an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer patients (P=0.017). Conclusions: Our study showed that EIF5A2 expression was positively associated with progression and aggressiveness of cervical cancer, and that EIF5A2 could serve as an independent prognostic marker in cervical cancer patients.

TI XPO1-Mediated EIF1AX Cytoplasmic Relocation Promotes Tumor Migration and
   Invasion in Endometrial Carcinoma
SO OXIDATIVE MEDICINE AND CELLULAR LONGEVITY
AB Dysregulation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1A, X-linked (EIF1AX), has been implicated in the pathogenesis of some cancers. However, the role of EIF1AX in endometrial carcinoma (EC) remains unknown. We investigated the EIF1AX expression in EC patients and assessed its tumorigenesis-associated function and nucleocytoplasmic transport mechanism in vitro and in vivo. The results indicated that the cytoplasmic EIF1AX expression showed a gradual increase when going from endometrium normal tissue, simple endometrial hyperplasia, complex endometrial hyperplasia, and endometrial atypical hyperplasia to EC, while vice versa for the nuclear EIF1AX expression. In addition, the cytoplasmic EIF1AX expression was positively correlated with histologic type, high International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) grade, advanced FIGO stage, deeper infiltration, high Ki67 index, and shorter recurrence-free survival in EC patients. In vitro, short hairpin RNA-mediated EIF1AX depletion or SV40NLS-mediated EIF1AX import into the nucleus in multiple human EC cells potently suppressed cell migration and invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and lung metastasis. Moreover, exportin 1 induced the transport of EIF1AX from the nucleus to the cytoplasm that could be inhibited by leptomycin B treatment or the mutation in the EIF1AX location sequence. These results demonstrate that cytoplasmic EIF1AX may play a key role in the incidence and promotion of EC, and thus, targeting EIF1AX or its nucleocytoplasmic transport process may offer an effective new therapeutic approach to EC.

TI Exploring links between 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases and
   Alzheimer's disease
SO ALZHEIMERS & DEMENTIA
AB Hypoxia, that is, an inadequate oxygen supply, is linked to neurodegeneration and patients with cardiovascular disease are prone to Alzheimer's disease (AD). 2-Oxoglutarate and ferrous iron-dependent oxygenases (2OGDD) play a key role in the regulation of oxygen homeostasis by acting as hypoxia sensors. 2OGDD also have roles in collagen biosynthesis, lipid metabolism, nucleic acid repair, and the regulation of transcription and translation. Many biological processes in which the >60 human 2OGDD are involved are altered in AD patient brains, raising the question as to whether 2OGDD are involved in the transition from normal aging to AD. Here we give an overview of human 2OGDD and critically discuss their potential roles in AD, highlighting possible relationships with synapse dysfunction/loss. 2OGDD may regulate neuronal/glial differentiation through enzyme activity-dependent mechanisms and modulation of their activity has potential to protect against synapse loss. Work linking 2OGDD and AD is at an early stage, especially from a therapeutic perspective; we suggest integrated pathology and in vitro discovery research to explore their roles in AD is merited. We hope to help enable long-term research on the roles of 2OGDD and, more generally, oxygen/hypoxia in AD. We also suggest shorter term empirically guided clinical studies concerning the exploration of 2OGDD/oxygen modulators to help maintain synaptic viability are of interest for AD treatment.

TI Fall Prevention Bingo: Effects of a Novel Community-based Education Tool
   on Older Adults Knowledge and Readiness to Reduce Risks for Falls
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH EDUCATION
AB Background: Fall prevention education can increase knowledge of fall risks and promote behavior changes to help reduce the incidence of falls among older adults. Fall Prevention Bingo (FPB) was created as an engaging tool to deliver fall prevention education to older adults.Purpose:To evaluate the effects of FPB on older adults' knowledge of fall risks, their readiness to make health behavior changes, and their attitudes toward reducing personal risks for falls.Methods:A total of 110 community-dwelling older adults (mean age: 72.0 +/- 10.2 years) participated in the study across 11 senior or community centers in St. Louis, Missouri, USA.Results:Knowledge of fall risk behaviors increased after playing FPB (p=.007). A ceiling effect occurred when measuring readiness to change. Participants reported that FPB was informative and interactive.Discussion:FPB is a fun and engaging educational tool that can be used to improve knowledge of fall risks among older adults. A ceiling effect obtained from the Stages of Change Score indicated that most participants had already made behavior changes to reduce risks for falls.Translation to Health Education Practice:FPB can be an effective method to deliver fall prevention education in community settings.

AB Heat shock transcription factor (Hsf) plays a transcriptional regulatory role in plants during heat stress and other abiotic stresses. 31 non-redundant ZmHsf genes from maize were identified and clustered in the reference genome sequenced by Single Molecule Real Time (SMRT). The amino acid length, chromosome location, and presence of functional domains and motifs of all ZmHsfs sequences were analyzed and determined. Phylogenetics and collinearity analyses reveal gene duplication events in Hsf family and collinearity blocks shared by maize, rice and sorghum. The results of RNA-Seq analysis of anthesis and post-anthesis periods in maize show different expression patterns of ZmHsf family members. Specially, ZmHsf26 of A2 subclass and ZmHsf23 of A6 subclass were distinctly up-regulated after heat shock (HS) at post-anthesis stage. Nanopore transcriptome sequencing of maize seedlings showed that alternative splicing (AS) events occur in ZmHsf04 and ZmHsf17 which belong to subclass A2 after heat shock. Through sequence alignment, semi-quantitative and quantitative RT-PCR, we found that intron retention events occur in response to heat shock, and newly splice isoforms, ZmHsf04-II and ZmHsf17-II, were transcribed. Both new isoforms contain several premature termination codons in their introns which may lead to early termination of translation. The ZmHsf04 expression was highly increased than that of ZmHsf17, and the up-regulation of ZmHsf04-I transcription level were significantly higher than that of ZmHsf04-II after HS.

TI Validation of reference genes for quantitative gene expression studies
   in Volvox carteri using real-time RT-PCR
SO MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTS
AB Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is a sensitive technique for analysis of gene expression under a wide diversity of biological conditions. However, the identification of suitable reference genes is a critical factor for analysis of gene expression data. To determine potential reference genes for normalization of qRT-PCR data in the green alga Volvox carteri, the transcript levels of ten candidate reference genes were measured by qRT-PCR in three experimental sample pools containing different developmental stages, cell types and stress treatments. The expression stability of the candidate reference genes was then calculated using the algorithms geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper. The genes for 18S ribosomal RNA (18S) and eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 2 (eef1) turned out to have the most stable expression levels among the samples both from different developmental stages and different stress treatments. The genes for the ribosomal protein L23 (rpl23) and the TATA-box binding protein (tbpA) showed equivalent transcript levels in the comparison of different cell types, and therefore, can be used as reference genes for cell-type specific gene expression analysis. Our results indicate that more than one reference gene is required for accurate normalization of qRT-PCRs in V. carteri. The reference genes in our study show a much better performance than the housekeeping genes used as a reference in previous studies.

TI The Development of Marxist Shakespearean Criticism in China
SO MULTICULTURAL SHAKESPEARE-TRANSLATION APPROPRIATION AND PERFORMANCE
AB Chinese Shakespearean criticism from Marxist perspectives is highly original in Chinese Shakespeare studies. Scholars such as Mao Dun, Yang Hui, Zhao Li, Fang Ping, Yang Zhouhan, Bian Zhilin, Meng Xianqiang, Sun Jiaxiu, Zhang Siyang and Wang Yuanhua adopt the basic principles and methods of Marxism to elaborate on Shakespeare's works and have made great achievements. With ideas changed in different political climates, they have engaged in Shakespeare studies for over eight decades since the 1930s. At the beginning of the revolutionary age, they advocated revolutionary literature, followed Russian Shakespearean criticism from the Marxist perspective, and established the mode of class analysis and highlighted realism. Before and after the Cultural Revolution, they were concerned about class, reality and people. They also showed the "left-wing" inclination, taking literature as a tool to serve politics. Since the 1980s, they have been free from politics and entered the pure academic realm, analysing Shakespearean dramas with Marxist aesthetic theories and transforming from sociological criticism to literary criticism.

TI Identification and community dynamics of fungi associated with root,
   crown, and foot rot of field pea in western Canada
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB Fungal and oomycete communities in symptomatic roots, crowns and lower stem tissues of field pea plants from sites across the Canadian prairies were characterized using plate culture and sequence-based identification. Symptomatic plants were sampled at the mid-flowering stage from a total of 21 fields in 2014 and 2015. Fungi and oomycete species were isolated on agar medium and grouped into operational taxonomic groups (OTU) based on their morphology. From the OTUs, 40 fungal and oomycete species were identified according to translation elongation factor-1 alpha or ITS sequences. Fusarium spp. accounted for more than 60 % of total isolations. The fungal communities were similar in roots and crowns, but differed from communities in lower stems. In 2014, the most prevalent fungi isolated from roots were F. avenaceum, F. solani and F. redolens, but F. solani was dominant in 2015. In crown tissues, F. avenaceum was most prevalent in 2014 but F. solani was more prevalent in 2015. Stem tissues were primarily colonized by Peyronellaea spp. (= Ascochyta / Phoma spp.) and Alternaria spp. in 2014, but there was a drastic decrease in Peyronellaea spp. in 2015. This study indicated that climate, primarily precipitation levels, and local edaphic characteristics may play a profound role in the structure of phytopathogen communities associated with the root and foot rot diseases complex of field pea on the Canadian prairies.

TI Design for poverty alleviation and craft revitalization in rural China
   from an actor-network perspective: the case of bamboo-weaving in
   Shengzhou
SO HERITAGE SCIENCE
AB Design for poverty alleviation (DPA) is becoming an active promoter and effective practice form of rural social innovation. This study aims to explore the sustainable, collaborative design path of rural poverty alleviation. Based on actor network theory, this study analyzes the poverty alleviation process of rural actor network construction and participatory translation through the perspective of design integration. The case study chooses the traditional Chinese handicraft, Shengzhou bamboo weaving, to discuss the key links and elements of sustainability such as the role, benefits, and interaction of multiple actors. The staged effectiveness and social impact of the design integration are evaluated by questionnaire surveys, in-depth interviews, qualitative and quantitative data collections, a logistic regression model was used to test for significant effects while adjusting for multiple factors simultaneously. The analysis shows that although DPA is difficult to realize the fundamental adjustment of the rights and interests of rural craftsmen, it plays a key role in guiding the development of industrial goals, expected economic and social benefits, brings huge driving force and implementation effect to rural social innovation. The actor network theory solves the problem of separation between the individual and network attributes of DPA among stakeholders, and provides an innovative basis for rural social innovation to choose effective design intervention and mechanisms to balance the rights and interests of various stakeholders.

TI The Arginine-Rich RNA-Binding Motif of HIV-1 Rev Is Intrinsically
   Disordered and Folds upon RRE Binding
SO BIOPHYSICAL JOURNAL
AB Arginine-rich motifs (ARMs) capable of binding diverse RNA structures play critical roles in transcription, translation, RNA trafficking, and RNA packaging. The regulatory HIV-1 protein Rev is essential for viral replication and belongs to the ARM family of RNA-binding proteins. During the early stages of the HIV-1 life cycle, incompletely spliced and full-length viral mRNAs are very inefficiently recognized by the splicing machinery of the host cell and are subject to degradation in the cell nucleus. These transcripts harbor the Rev Response Element (RRE), which orchestrates the interaction with the Rev ARM and the successive Rev-dependent mRNA export pathway. Based on established criteria for predicting intrinsic disorder, such as hydropathy, combined with significant net charge, the very basic primary sequences of ARMs are expected to adopt coil-like structures. Thus, we initiated this study to investigate the conformational changes of the Rev ARM associated with RNA binding. We used multidimensional NMR and circular dichroism spectroscopy to monitor the observed structural transitions, and described the conformational landscapes using statistical ensemble and molecular-dynamics simulations. The combined spectroscopic and simulated results imply that the Rev ARM is intrinsically disordered not only as an isolated peptide but also when it is embedded into an oligomerization-deficient Rev mutant. RRE recognition triggers a crucial coil-to-helix transition employing an induced-fit mechanism.

TI Functional roles of hnRNPA2/B1 regulated by METTL3 in mammalian
   embryonic development
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 (hnRNPA2/B1) plays an important role in RNA processing via in m(6)A modification of pre-mRNA or pre-miRNA. However, the functional role of and relationship between m(6)A and hnRNPA2/B1 in early embryonic development are unclear. Here, we found that hnRNPA2/B1 is crucial for early embryonic development by virtue of regulating specific gene transcripts. HnRNPA2/B1 was localized to the nucleus and cytoplasm during subsequent embryonic development, starting at fertilization. Knockdown of hnRNPA2/B1 delayed embryonic development after the 4-cell stage and blocked further development. RNA-Seq analysis revealed changes in the global expression patterns of genes involved in transcription, translation, cell cycle, embryonic stem cell differentiation, and RNA methylation in hnRNPA2/B1 KD blastocysts. The levels of the inner cell mass markers OCT4 and SOX2 were decreased in hnRNPA2/B1 KD blastocysts, whereas that of the differentiation marker GATA4 was decreased. N6-Adenosine methyltransferase METTL3 knock-down caused embryonic developmental defects similar to those in hnRNPA2/B1 KD embryos. Moreover, METTL3 KD blastocysts showed increased mis-localization of hnRNPA2/B1 and decreased m(6)A RNA methylation. Taken together, our results suggest that hnRNPA2/B1 is essential for early embryogenesis through the regulation of transcription-related factors and determination of cell fate transition. Moreover, hnRNPA2/B1 is regulated by METTL3-dependent m(6)A RNA methylation.

TI Naked mole rats can undergo developmental, oncogene-induced and DNA
   damage-induced cellular senescence
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Cellular senescence is an important anticancer mechanism that restricts proliferation of damaged or premalignant cells. Cellular senescence also plays an important role in tissue remodeling during development. However, there is a trade-off associated with cellular senescence as senescent cells contribute to aging pathologies. The naked mole rat (NMR) (Heterocephalus glaber) is the longest-lived rodent that is resistant to a variety of age-related diseases. Remarkably, NMRs do not show aging phenotypes until very late stages of their lives. Here, we tested whether NMR cells undergo cellular senescence. We report that the NMR displays developmentally programmed cellular senescence in multiple tissues, including nail bed, skin dermis, hair follicle, and nasopharyngeal cavity. NMR cells also underwent cellular senescence when transfected with oncogenic Ras. In addition, cellular senescence was detected in NMR embryonic and skin fibroblasts subjected to.-irradiation (IR). However, NMR cells required a higher dose of IR for induction of cellular senescence, and NMR fibroblasts were resistant to IR-induced apoptosis. Gene expression analyses of senescence-related changes demonstrated that, similar to mice, NMR cells up-regulated senescence-associated secretory phenotype genes but displayed more profound down-regulation of DNA metabolism, transcription, and translation than mouse cells. We conclude that the NMR displays the same types of cellular senescence found in a short-lived rodent.

TI Regulatory roles of NAT10 in airway epithelial cell function and
   metabolism in pathological conditions
SO CELL BIOLOGY AND TOXICOLOGY
AB N-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10), a nuclear acetyltransferase and a member of the GNAT family, plays critical roles in RNA stability and translation processes as well as cell proliferation. Little is known about regulatory effects of NAT10 in lung epithelial cell proliferation. We firstly investigated NTA10 mRNA expression in alveolar epithelial types I and II, basal, ciliated, club, and goblet/mucous epithelia from heathy and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, lung adenocarcinoma, para-tumor tissue, and systemic sclerosis, respectively. We selected A549 cells for representative of alveolar epithelia or H1299 and H460 cells as airway epithelia with different genetic backgrounds and studied dynamic responses of NAT10-down-regulated epithelia to high temperature, lipopolysaccharide, cigarette smoking extract (CSE), drugs, radiation, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors at various doses. We also compared transcriptomic profiles between alveolar and airway epithelia, between cells with or without NAT10 down-regulation, between early and late stages, and between challenges. The present study demonstrated that NAT10 expression increased in human lung epithelia and varied among epithelial types, challenges, and diseases. Knockdown of NAT10 altered epithelial mitochondrial functions, dynamic responses to LPS, CSE, or PI3K inhibitors, and transcriptomic phenomes. NAT10 regulates biological phenomes, and behaviors are more complex and are dependent upon multiple signal pathways. Thus, NAT10-associated signal pathways can be a new alternative for understanding the disease and developing new biomarkers and targets.

TI Integrative proteomics and bioinformatic prediction enable a
   high-confidence apicoplast proteome in malaria parasites
SO PLOS BIOLOGY
AB Malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) and related apicomplexan pathogens contain a non-photosynthetic plastid called the apicoplast. Derived from an unusual secondary eukaryote- eukaryote endosymbiosis, the apicoplast is a fascinating organelle whose function and biogenesis rely on a complex amalgamation of bacterial and algal pathways. Because these pathways are distinct from the human host, the apicoplast is an excellent source of novel antimalarial targets. Despite its biomedical importance and evolutionary significance, the absence of a reliable apicoplast proteome has limited most studies to the handful of pathways identified by homology to bacteria or primary chloroplasts, precluding our ability to study the most novel apicoplast pathways. Here, we combine proximity biotinylation-based proteomics (BiolD) and a new machine learning algorithm to generate a high-confidence apicoplast proteome consisting of 346 proteins. Critically, the high accuracy of this proteome significantly outperforms previous prediction-based methods and extends beyond other BiolD studies of unique parasite compartments. Half of identified proteins have unknown function, and 77% are predicted to be important for normal blood-stage growth. We validate the apicoplast localization of a subset of novel proteins and show that an ATP-binding cassette protein ABCF1 is essential for blood-stage survival and plays a previously unknown role in apicoplast biogenesis. These findings indicate critical organellar functions for newly discovered apicoplast proteins. The apicoplast proteome will be an important resource for elucidating unique pathways derived from secondary endosymbiosis and prioritizing antimalarial drug targets.

TI High EIF2B5 mRNA expression and its prognostic significance in liver
   cancer: a study based on the TCGA and GEO database
SO CANCER MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH
AB Purpose: Liver cancer is a high mortality disease with no curable treatments. Posttranscriptional modifications play essential roles in the occurrence and the progression of liver cancer. EIF2B5 is a subunit of EIF2B that regulates the initiation and the rate of translation and participates in several diseases including tumors. This study aims to elucidate the prognostic significance of EIF2B5 in liver cancer.
   Materials and methods: We used The Cancer Genome Atlas database to analyze the expression of EIF2B5 in liver cancer. Then we used chi-squared and Fisher exact tests to test the correlation between clinical characteristics and EIF2B5 expression. Finally, we assessed the role of EIF2B5 in prognosis by Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox analysis. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed by using The Cancer Genome Atlas data set.
   Results: The results showed that EIF2B5 was upregulated in liver cancer, and the expression was related to histologic grade, clinical stage, and vital status. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox analysis implicated that highly expressed EIF2B5 correlated with poor prognosis, and EIF2B5 was an independent risk factor for liver cancer. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that AfR and BRCA pathway, cell cycle pathway, DNA repair, myc signaling pathway, and E2F targets are differentially enriched in EIF2B5 high-expression phenotype.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that EIF2B5 participated in cancer progression and could become a biomarker for the prognosis of patients with liver cancer.

TI Molecular characterization of surface antigen 10 of Eimeria tenella
SO PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
AB Chicken coccidiosis is caused by the apicomplexan parasite Eimeria spp. At present, drug resistance of Eimeria is common because of the indiscriminate use of anticoccidial drugs. The gene encoding surface antigen 10 of Eimeria tenella (EtSAG10) is differentially expressed between drug-resistant and drug-sensitive strains. RNA-seq analysis indicated that this gene was downregulated in strains resistant to maduramicin and diclazuril compared to susceptible strains. EtSAG10 DNA sequence alignment revealed that they contained one and ten mutations in MRR and DZR, compared with DS, respectively. A full-length EtSAG10 cDNA was successfully cloned and expressed, and the polyclonal antibody was prepared. The transcription and translation levels of EtSAG10 were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and Western blotting. The localization of EtSAG10 in Spz, Mrz, and parasites in the first asexual stage was determined by indirect immunofluorescence. The potential association of EtSAG10 with sporozoite invasion of host cells was assessed by invasion inhibition assays. The results showed that EtSAG10 had a predicted transmembrane domain at the C-terminal end and a predicted signal peptide at the N-terminal end. EtSAG10 was downregulated in drug-resistant strains, which is consistent with the RNA-seq results. The EtSAG10 protein was localized to the parasite surface and parasitophorous vacuole membrane. This protein was shown to play a role in the infection of chicken intestine by sporozoites.

TI Tumor-derived exosomal non-coding RNAs as diagnostic biomarkers in
   cancer
SO CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR LIFE SCIENCES
AB Almost all clinical oncologists agree that the discovery of reliable, accessible, and non-invasive biomarkers is necessary to decrease cancer mortality. It is possible to employ reliable biomarkers to diagnose cancer in the early stages, predict the patient prognosis, follow up the response to treatment, and estimate the risk of disease recurrence with high sensitivity and specificity. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), especially exosomes, have been the focus of translational research to develop such biomarkers over the past decade. The abundance and distribution of exosomes in bodily fluids, including serum, saliva, and urine, as well as their ability to transport various biomolecules (nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids) derived from their parent cells, make exosomes reliable, accessible, and potent biomarkers for diagnosis and follow-up of solid and hematopoietic tumors. In addition, exosomes play a vital role in various cellular processes, including tumor progression, by participating in intercellular communication. Although these advantages underline the high potential of tumor-derived exosomes as diagnostic biomarkers, the lack of standardized effective methods for their isolation, identification, and precise characterization makes their application challenging in clinical settings. We discuss the importance of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in cellular processes, and the role of tumor-derived exosomes containing ncRNAs as potential biomarkers in several types of cancer. In addition, the advantages and challenges of these studies for translation into clinical applications are covered.

TI The loss of function of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5 (CDK5) alters the
   Cytoskeleton and decrease the in vitro Dengue Virus-2 infection
SO ACTA BIOLOGICA COLOMBIANA
AB Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5 (CDK5) regulates several functions in neurons, endothelial, and epithelial cells, including the cytoskeleton dynamics. Likewise, it has been reported that some cytoskeleton elements, such as actin filaments and microtubules, play an essential role during Dengue virus (DENV) infection. This work aimed to evaluate the role of CDK5 during DENV-2 infection by two methods, chemical inhibition, and gene silencing. The antiviral activity of roscovitine was evaluated using Plaque Forming Units (PFU) assay. The transfection efficiency and knockdown of CDK5, using artificial miRNAs, was carried out by flow cytometry. The effect on the viral envelope protein and cytoskeleton elements was evidenced by advanced fluorescence microscopy and image analysis. Roscovitine showed antiviral activity in pre and post-infection stages in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment with roscovitine and miRCDK5 decrease the amount of CDK5 in uninfected cells. In cells infected and transfected with miRCDK5, as well as treated with the inhibitor, a significant reduction of the viral envelope protein was observed; however, no significant reduction of CDK5 was found. Also, evident morphological cellular changes were observed during the treatment with roscovitine in infected cells. The results indicate the potential participation of CDK5 during DENV-2 infection, possibly mediating protein translation or replication of the viral genome through the cytoskeletal dynamics regulation. Additional data are required to clarify the mechanistic of these phenomena using alternative methods.

TI Participatory budgeting in a local government in a vertical society: A
   Japanese story
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
AB This article examines a case of participatory budgeting in Japanese local government. The article demonstrates how cultural values interact with stages of budgeting (in our case, the co-planning or consultation phase of budgeting). We find three key stakeholders - councillors, administrators and citizens - have varying degree of participation in the budget process. While direct citizen participation has been limited and challenging, we find that local associations and councillors work as lobbyists to influence the budget less publicly. The budget desk led by the mayor plays the dominant role. This article contributes to the broader debate on local government reforms and their translation into varied contexts by problematising such a linear adoption of knowledge from a cultural perspective. Points for practitioners We offer caution to policymakers about the wholesale adoption of knowledge from one context to the other. In the Japanese context, we urge them to draw on the strengths of grouping behaviour. Hence, engagement with associations, communities and various interests groups must be emphasised instead of simply relying on direct yet remote communications to citizens. Political engagements by the departments - perhaps via political parties - can be adopted before budget proposals are made to the local authority council. This will allow more space for the councillors to make their case to citizens, and maintain harmony (wa) within and between political groups.

TI Role of IGF2BP3 in trophoblast cell invasion and migration
SO CELL DEATH & DISEASE
AB The insulin-like growth factor-2 mRNA-binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3) is a member of a highly conserved protein family that is expressed specifically in placenta, testis and various cancers, but is hardly detectable in normal adult tissues. IGF2BP3 has important roles in RNA stabilization and translation, especially during early stages of both human and mouse embryogenesis. Placenta is an indispensable organ in mammalian reproduction that connects developing fetus to the uterine wall, and is responsible for nutrient uptake, waste elimination and gas exchange. Fetus development in the maternal uterine cavity depends on the specialized functional trophoblast. Whether IGF2BP3 plays a role in trophoblast differentiation during placental development has never been examined. The data obtained in this study revealed that IGF2BP3 was highly expressed in human placental villi during early pregnancy, especially in cytotrophoblast cells (CTBs) and trophoblast column, but a much lower level of IGF2BP3 was detected in the third trimester placental villi. Furthermore, the expression level of IGF2BP3 in pre-eclamptic (PE) placentas was significantly lower than the gestational age-matched normal placentas. The role of IGF2BP3 in human trophoblast differentiation was shown by in vitro cell invasion and migration assays and an ex vivo explant culture model. Our data support a role of IGF2BP3 in promoting trophoblast invasion and suggest that abnormal expression of IGF2BP3 might be associated with the etiology of PE.

TI NEW INSIGHTS INTO MECHANISMS OF SONOTHROMBOLYSIS USING ULTRA-HIGH-SPEED
   IMAGING
SO ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
AB Thrombotic arterial occlusion is the principal etiology for acute cardiovascular syndromes such as stroke, myocardial infarction and unstable angina. Exposing the thrombus to ultrasound and microbubbles facilitates thrombus disruption, making "sonothrombolysis" a potentially powerful therapeutic strategy for thromboembolic diseases. However, optimization of such a strategy, and hence clinical translation, is constrained by an incomplete understanding of mechanisms by which ultrasound-induced microbubble vibrations disrupt blood clots. We posit that previously reported sonothrombolytic efficacy using inertial cavitation regimes was due, at least in part, to mechanical clot disruption by oscillating microbubbles. To test this hypothesis, we optically characterized lipid microbubble interactions with thrombus in the presence of ultrasound using a recently developed ultra-high-speed microscopy imaging system to visualize microbubble acoustic behaviors at megahertz frame rates. A microscope/acoustic stage designed for the system allowed an experimentally created thrombus and microbubbles to be insonified at a co-localized acoustic and optical focus during synchronized high-speed imaging. Under inertial cavitation conditions, large-amplitude microbubble oscillations caused thrombus deformation and pitting. Acoustic radiation forces (Bjerknes forces) further augmented microbubble-thrombus interaction. These observations suggest that a direct mechanical effect of oscillating lipid microbubbles on an adjacent thrombus may play a role in mediating clot disruption in the presence of specific ultrasound conditions.

TI Translating AI to Clinical Practice: Overcoming Data Shift with
   Explainability
SO RADIOGRAPHICS
AB To translate artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms into clinical practice requires generalizability of models to real-world data. One of the main obstacles to generalizability is data shift, a data distribution mismatch between model training and real envi-ronments. Explainable AI techniques offer tools to detect and mitigate the data shift problem and develop reliable AI for clinical practice. Most medical AI is trained with datasets gathered from limited environments, such as restricted disease populations and center-dependent acquisition conditions. The data shift that commonly exists in the limited training set often causes a sig-nificant performance decrease in the deployment environment. To develop a medical application, it is important to detect poten-tial data shift and its impact on clinical translation. During AI training stages, from premodel analysis to in-model and post hoc explanations, explainability can play a key role in detecting model susceptibility to data shift, which is otherwise hidden because the test data have the same biased distribution as the training data. Performance-based model assessments cannot effectively distinguish the model overfitting to training data bias without enriched test sets from external environments. In the absence of such external data, explainability techniques can aid in translating AI to clinical practice as a tool to detect and mitigate poten-tial failures due to data shift.

TI Epigenetic combined with transcriptomic analysis of the m6A methylome
   after spared nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain in mice
SO NEURAL REGENERATION RESEARCH
AB Epigenetic changes in the spinal cord play a key role in the initiation and maintenance of nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is one of the most abundant internal RNA modifications and plays an essential function in gene regulation in many diseases. However, the global m6A modification status of mRNA in the spinal cord at different stages after neuropathic pain is unknown. In this study, we established a neuropathic pain model in mice by preserving the complete sural nerve and only damaging the common peroneal nerve. High-throughput methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing results showed that after spared nerve injury, there were 55 m6A methylated and differentially expressed genes in the spinal cord. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway results showed that m6A modification triggered inflammatory responses and apoptotic processes in the early stages after spared nerve injury. Over time, the differential gene function at postoperative day 7 was enriched in "positive regulation of neurogenesis" and "positive regulation of neural precursor cell proliferation." These functions suggested that altered synaptic morphological plasticity was a turning point in neuropathic pain formation and maintenance. Results at postoperative day 14 suggested that the persistence of neuropathic pain might be from lipid metabolic processes, such as "very-low-density lipoprotein particle clearance," "negative regulation of cholesterol transport" and "membrane lipid catabolic process." We detected the expression of m6A enzymes and found elevated mRNA expression of Ythdf2 and Ythdf3 after spared nerve injury modeling. We speculate that m6A reader enzymes also have an important role in neuropathic pain. These results provide a global landscape of mRNA m6A modifications in the spinal cord in the spared nerve injury model at different stages after injury.

TI Expression profile of RNA binding protein in cervical cancer using
   bioinformatics approach
SO CANCER CELL INTERNATIONAL
AB Background It has been demonstrated by studies globally that RNA binding proteins (RBPs) took part in the development of cervical cancer (CC). Few studies concentrated on the correlation between RBPs and overall survival of CC patients. We retrieved significant DEGs (differently expressed genes, RNA binding proteins) correlated to the process of cervical cancer development. Methods Expressions level of genes in cervical cancer and normal tissue samples were obtained from GTEx and TCGA database. Differently expressed RNA binding proteins (DEGs) were retrieved by Wilcoxon sum-rank test. ClusterProfiler package worked in R software was used to perform GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. Univariate proportional hazard cox regression and multivariate proportional hazard cox regressions were applied to identify DEGs equipped with prognostic value and other clinical independent risk factors. ROC curve was drawn for comparing the survival predict feasibility of risk score with other risk factors in CC patients. Nomogram was drawn to exhibit the prediction model and validated by C-index and calibration curve. Correlations between differentially expressed RNA binding proteins (DEGs) and other clinical features were investigated by t test or Cruskal Wallis analysis. Correlation between Immune and DEGs in cervical cancer was investigated by ssGSEA. Results 347 differentially expressed RBPs (DEGs) were retrieved from cervical cancer tissue and normal tissue samples. GO enrichment analysis showed that these DEGs involved in RNA splicing, catabolic process and metabolism. Cox regression model showed that there were ten DEGs significantly associated with overall survival of cervical cancer patients. WDR43 (HR = 0.423, P = 0.008), RBM38 (HR = 0.533, P < 0.001), RNASEH2A (HR = 0.474, P = 0.002) and HENMT1 (HR = 0.720, P = 0.071) played protective roles in survival among these ten genes. Stage (Stage IV vs Stage I HR = 3.434, P < 0.001) and risk score (HR = 1.214, P < 0.001) were sorted as independent prognostic risk factors based on multivariate cox regression. ROC curve validated that risk score was preferable to predict survival of CC patients than other risk factors. Additionally, we found some of these ten predictor DEGs were correlated significantly in statistic with tumor grade or stage, clinical T stage, clinical N stage, pathology or risk score (all P < 0.05). Part of immune cells and immune functions showed a lower activity in high risk group than low risk group which is stratified by median risk score. Conclusion Our discovery showed that many RNA binding proteins involved in the progress of cervical cancer, which could probably serve as prognostic biomarkers and accelerate the discovery of treatment targets for CC patients.

TI Pilot Study of Serum MicroRNA-21 as a Diagnostic and Prognostic
   Biomarker in Egyptian Breast Cancer Patients
SO MOLECULAR DIAGNOSIS & THERAPY
AB Background MicroRNAs are small RNA molecules that bind to complementary sequences of target messenger RNAs and down-regulate their translation to protein or degrade them. MicroRNAs play critical roles in many different cellular processes. Hence, aberrant microRNA expression is common in a variety of disorders, including cancer.
   Patients and Methods In this work, we quantified serum microRNA-21 (miR-21) expression levels in 30 breast cancer patients, 30 cancer-free individuals with risk factors for developing breast cancer, and another 30 controls without risk factors, in order to test the role of miR-21 as a possible diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in breast cancer.
   Results Our results indicated that miR-21 expression was elevated in asymptomatic high-risk individuals (2.98-fold) compared with healthy non-risk controls (p < 0.001), and was increased in almost all sera of cancer patients (12.72-fold) compared with healthy controls (p < 0.001). Higher levels of serum miR-21 were also correlated with tumors of higher grades, more nodal involvement, distal metastasis and advanced clinical stages (p < 0.01). Furthermore, over-expression levels declined towards normal after surgical tumor resection (p < 0.001).
   Conclusion In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that serum miR-21 expression profile may serve as a potential non-invasive diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for breast cancer.

TI Cladosporium species causing leaf spot on silage maize based on
   multi-locus phylogeny in China
SO JOURNAL OF PHYTOPATHOLOGY
AB Qinghai Province is one of China's five major pastoral areas located in the northeastern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and animal husbandry plays a great part in the local economy. One of the most important crops in Qinghai Province is maize for silage, which sustains ecological animal husbandry. However, the leaf spot disease of maize has seriously impeded the healthy development of the maize industry. We found that from 2019 to 2020 leaf spot of silage maize caused by Cladosporium was a common disease in Qinghai Province. This leaf spot disease formed water-soaked round or irregular spots at the early stage and gradually expanded to black at the later stage, and the incidence of the leaf spot in the fields reached 15%-45%. In this study, 125 isolates were isolated from seven locations in Qinghai Province, with 123 isolated from leaves and two isolated from bracts of maize for silage. Their phylogeny, morphology, and pathogenicity were analysed to identify pathogens and investigate the differences among them. Based on phylogenetic analysis of multi-locus (ITS, actin, and translation elongation factor (1-alpha)) sequences and morphology characteristics, the 125 isolates were identified to belong to eight species of Cladosporium: C. allicinum, C. cladosporioides, C. xylophilum, C. herbarum, C. macrocarpum, C. asperulatum, C. subinflatum, and C. floccosum. Pathogenicity tests by artificial inoculation demonstrated that 125 isolates were pathogenic on eight maize cultivars for silage, and pathogenicity differentiation was not observed. Taken together, our results demonstrated that these eight species of Cladosporium caused leaf spot disease of maize in Qinghai Province. This is the first analysis report on Cladosporium species from maize in China, and our findings provide a theoretical foundation for the management of this disease in the future.

TI Integrated transcriptome and proteome analysis provides insights into
   the mechanism of cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) in tobacco (Nicotiana
   tabacum L.)
SO JOURNAL OF PROTEOMICS
AB Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is critical in maximizing crop yield and quality by utilizing tobacco heterosis. However, the mechanism of tobacco CMS formation remains unknown. Using paraffin section observation, transcriptome sequencing, and TMT proteomic analysis, this study describes the differences in expression profiles in morphology, transcription, and translation between the sua-CMS tobacco line (MSYY87) and its corresponding maintainer line (YY87). According to the microspore morphology, MSYY87 began to exhibit abnormal micro -spore development during the early stages of germination and differentiation (androgynous primordium dif-ferentiation stage). According to transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, 17 genes/proteins involved in lipid transport/binding and phenylpropane metabolism were significantly down-regulated at both the mRNA and protein levels. Through further analysis, we identified some key genes that may be involved in tobacco male sterility, including beta-GLU related to energy metabolism, 4CL and bHLHs related to anther wall formation, nsLTPs related to pollen germination and anther cuticle, and bHLHs related to pollen tapetum degradation. We speculate that the down-regulation of these genes affects the normal physiological metabolism, making tobacco plants show male sterility.Significance: Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) plays a vital role in utilizing tobacco heterosis and enhancing crop yield and quality. We observed paraffin sections and conducted transcriptome sequencing and mitochondrial proteomics to examine the tobacco CMS line Yunyan 87 (MSYY87) and its maintainer line Yunyan 87 (YY87). The down-regulation expression of beta-GLU resulted in insufficient ATP supply, which resulted in disordered en-ergy metabolism. The down-regulation expression of 4CL, nsLTPs and bHLHs may affect the formation of anther wall and anther cuticle, pollen germination, as well as the degradation of pollen tapetum. These various abnormal physiological processes, the male sterility of tobacco is finally caused. The findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms of tobacco CMS and serve as a model for fertility research in other flowering plants.

TI Theatre Strikes Back in the Digital Era: An Interview with Stephan

SO MULTICULTURAL SHAKESPEARE-TRANSLATION APPROPRIATION AND PERFORMANCE
AB In this edited interview, Stephan Wolfert, American actor and playwright, talks about his pluri-awarded play, Cry Havoc, a one-man show he has been performing since 2012 with several variations through the years; the play is autobiographical but it is also the exemplary story of many US veterans who cannot find a way to readjust to civilian rules once they come back home. The play tells of Wolfert's struggle with Shakespeare's words in order to find his own voice to speak what could not be said differently: his own trauma. By bringing to the fore a number of veterans in Shakespeare's plays, starting from Richard III to Hotspur, Henry V, Coriolanus and many others, Wolfert fascinatingly lights up corners of the Shakespearean macro-text which we knew were there without really seeing them. Wolfert's approach, in his show as well as in the use of Shakespeare within the DE-CRUIT Veterans Programme he founded, highlights the importance of human interaction through the mediation of the most ancient among media: theatre. Shakespeare's writing for the theatre, with its characteristic intermedial quality (as it is suspended between page and stage) and cross-cultural inclination (as it has travelled the world), reactivates a holistic sense of the body and, in so doing, it channels powerful and deep physical emotions that can be expressed and shared with mutual benefit by actors and audience alike within the safe communication environment of theatre. Wolfert's work makes the most of all this and even puts Shakespeare's language to a therapeutic use for US veterans.

TI The UPR in atherosclerosis
SO SEMINARS IN IMMUNOPATHOLOGY
AB Multiple systemic factors and local stressors in the arterial wall can disturb the functions of endoplasmic reticulum (ER), causing ER stress in endothelial cells (ECs), smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and macrophages during the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. As a protective response to restore ER homeostasis, the unfolded protein response (UPR) is initiated by three major ER sensors: protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring protein 1 alpha (IRE1 alpha), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). The activation of the various UPR signaling pathways displays a temporal pattern of activation at different stages of the disease. The ATF6 and IRE1 alpha pathways that promote the expression of protein chaperones in ER are activated in ECs in athero-susceptible regions of pre-lesional arteries and before the appearance of foam cells. The PERK pathway that reduces ER protein client load by blocking protein translation is activated in SMCs and macrophages in early lesions. The activation of these UPR signaling pathways aims to cope with the ER stress and plays a pro-survival role in the early stage of atherosclerosis. However, with the progression of atherosclerosis, the extended duration and increased intensity of ER stress in lesions lead to prolonged and enhanced UPR signaling. Under this circumstance, the PERK pathway induces expression of death effectors, and possibly IRE1 alpha activates apoptosis signaling pathways, leading to apoptosis of macrophages and SMCs in advanced lesions. Importantly, UPR-mediated cell death is associated with plaque instability and the clinical progression of atherosclerosis. Moreover, UPR signaling is linked to inflammation and possibly to macrophage differentiation in lesions. Therapeutic approaches targeting the UPR may have promise in the prevention and/or regression of atherosclerosis. However, more progress is needed to fully understand all of the roles of the UPR in atherosclerosis and to harness this information for therapeutic advances.

Temporal expression of Pmcyclin B in different tissues, including ovary, lymphoid organ, brain, blood, muscle, heart, gill, hepatopancreas, and intestine, were quantified by quantitative real time PCR. Messenger RNA expression levels of Pmcyclin B were greatest in the ovary, compared to other tissues (P < 0.05). Temporal expression of Pmcyclin B in the ovary at six different developmental stages was investigated by real-time PCR; no significant difference was observed (P < 0.05). Recombinant Pmcyclin B protein and its polyclonal antibody were successfully produced. Western blot analysis revealed differential expression of Pmcyclin B in ovaries in developmental stages II to IV; a positive signal (45 kDa) was observed in all ovarian stages assessed, but was most intense at stage III. Pmcyclin B protein was assessed by immunohistochemistry and was localized to the cytoplasm of prophase oocytes at stage II and enriched in the nuclei of pro-metaphase oocytes at stages III and IV. Results from this study indicate that Pmcyclin B is constitutively expressed and plays an important role in ovarian maturation in P. monodon.

TI Inactivation of the mitochondrial protease Afg3l2 results in severely
   diminished respiratory chain activity and widespread defects in
   mitochondrial gene expression
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB Author summary Mitochondria produce virtually all of the cellular energy through the actions of the respiratory chain (RC) complexes. However, mitochondria also present a quality control challenge for the eukaryotic cell. In particular, biogenesis of the RC complexes depends on the coordinated expression of nuclear and mitochondrially encoded subunits and an imbalance in this process can cause protein aggregation. Moreover, the RC complexes produce highly damaging reactive oxygen species as a side product of their activity. The Mitochondrial AAA(+)family of proteases are believed to provide the first line of defense against these insults. The importance of this protease family is best exemplified by the severe neurodegenerative diseases that are caused by mutations in their respective genes. To better understand the biological roles of the AAA(+)proteases, and the physiological consequences of their inactivation we used a genetic approach inDrosophilato study the Afg3l2 AAA(+)protease. Partial inactivation of theAFG3L2gene resulted in mitochondrial functional deficits, shortened lifespan, and neurodegeneration. Unexpectedly, we found that severely diminished mitochondrial gene expression, including transcription, and translation, primarily accounts for these phenotypes. The defects in gene expression appear to be caused by a failure in mitochondrial ribosome maturation and assembly, and possibly, sequestration of regulatory factors into inactive aggregates. Our work indicates Afg3l2 plays critical roles in degrading unfolded mitochondrial proteins and regulating mitochondrial gene expression, and that strategies to address these matters could be therapeutic in the diseases caused by mutations in theAFG3L2gene.
   Them-AAA proteases play a critical role in the proteostasis of inner mitochondrial membrane proteins, and mutations in the genes encoding these proteases cause severe incurable neurological diseases. To further explore the biological role of them-AAA proteases and the pathological consequences of their deficiency, we used a genetic approach in the fruit flyDrosophila melanogasterto inactivate the ATPase family gene 3-like 2 (AFG3L2) gene, which encodes a critical component of them-AAA proteases. We found that null alleles ofDrosophila AFG3L2die early in development, but partial inactivation ofAFG3L2using RNAi allowed survival to the late pupal and adult stages of development. Flies with partial inactivation ofAFG3L2exhibited behavioral defects, neurodegeneration, accumulation of unfolded mitochondrial proteins, and diminished respiratory chain (RC) activity. Further work revealed that the reduced RC activity was primarily a consequence of severely diminished mitochondrial transcription and translation. These defects were accompanied by activation of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mito-UPR) and autophagy. Overexpression of mito-UPR components partially rescued theAFG3L2-deficient phenotypes, indicating that protein aggregation partly accounts for the defects ofAFG3L2-deficient animals. Our work suggests that strategies designed to activate mitochondrial stress pathways and mitochondrial gene expression could be therapeutic in the diseases caused by mutations inAFG3L2.

TI Research, Practice, and Policy Partnerships in Pan-Canadian Coalitions
   for Cancer and Chronic Disease Prevention
SO JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICE
AB Objective: To describe the development stages of the Coalitions Linking Action and Science for Prevention (CLASP) initiative of the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer to support research, practice, and policy coalitions focused on cancer and chronic disease prevention in Canada. Design: Coalitions Linking Action and Science for Prevention was implemented in 3 stages. This article describes Stage 1 that consisted of an online concept-mapping consultation process, 3 topic specific networking and consultation workshops, and 3 context-specific networking, coalition development, and planning meetings. These were all completed using a participatory engagement approach to encourage knowledge exchange across jurisdictions and sectors in Canada. Setting: Toronto, Ontario; Calgary, Alberta; Montreal, Quebec; and Ottawa, Ontario. Participants: More than 500 researchers, practitioners, and policy specialists were invited to take part in the first stage activities. Main Outcome Measures: (1) Participant-identified high-priority opportunities for strategic collaboration; (2) Cross-jurisdictional and cross-sector representation; and (3) Participant feedback on the CLASP processes and activities. Results: Participants from Stage 1 activities were distributed across all provinces/territories; 3 jurisdictional levels; and research, practice, and policy sectors. Ninety priority opportunities for strategic collaboration were identified across all 3 workshops. Participants provided detailed feedback about transparency of the RFP (Request for Proposals) application process, support needed to level the playing field for potential applicants, and valuable suggestions for the adjudication process. Conclusions: Coalitions Linking Action and Science for Prevention engaged hundreds of research, practice, and policy experts across Canada focusing social-behavioral, clinical, and environmental and occupational opportunities for cancer and chronic disease prevention. Given the extent of expert and jurisdictional engagement, the substantial Partnership investment in a participatory engagement approach to RFP development and potential applicant response suggests that efforts to link cancer and chronic disease prevention efforts across jurisdictions and through research, practice, and policy collaboration may require this type of a priori investment in networking, communication, coordination, and collaboration.

TI Implementation of UNICEF and WHO's care for child development package:
   Lessons from a global review and key informant interviews
SO FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Introduction In the last decade, there has been increased global policy and program momentum to promote early childhood development. The Care for Child Development (CCD) package, developed by UNICEF and the WHO, is a key tool responding to the global demand. The CCD package comprises two age-specific evidence-based recommendations for caregivers to 1) play and communicate and 2) responsively interact with their children (0-5 years) and was designed to be integrated within existing services to strengthen nurturing care for child development. The aim of this report was to provide an up-to-date global review of the implementation and evaluation of the CCD package.Methods In addition to a systematic review of 55 reports, we interviewed 23 key informants (including UNICEF and WHO personnel) to better understand the implementation of CCD.Results The CCD package has been or is being implemented in 54 low- and middle-income countries and territories, and it has been integrated into government services across the health, social, and education sectors in 26 countries. Across these contexts, CCD has been adapted in three primary ways: 1) translations of CCD materials (mostly counseling cards) into local language(s), 2) adaptations of CCD materials for the local context, vulnerable children, or a humanitarian/emergency setting (e.g., including local play activities, using activities that are better suited to children with visual impairments), and 3) substantive modifications to the content of CCD materials (e.g., expansion of play and communication activities, addition of new themes, creation of a structured curriculum). While there is promising evidence and examples of good implementation practice, there has been mixed experience about implementation of CCD with respect to adaptation, training, supervision, integration into existing services, and monitoring implementation fidelity and quality. For example, many users of CCD found difficulties with training the workforce, garnering buy-in from governments, and ensuring benefits for families, among others.Discussion Additional knowledge on how to improve the effectiveness, implementation fidelity and quality, and acceptance of CCD is needed. Based on the findings of the review we make recommendations for future efforts to implement CCD at-scale.

TI PTOLEMY CHENNUS?NOVEL HISTORY(PHOT.BIBL.190) br
SO SCHOLE-FILOSOFSKOE ANTIKOVEDENIE I KLASSICHESKAYA
   TRADITSIYA-SCHOLE-ANCIENT PHILOSOPHY AND THE CLASSICAL TRADITION
AB Ptolemy Chennus is a poorly known Roman author who wrote in Greek and lived in the late 1st -beginning of 2nd century AD. His works are enumerated in the cor-responding article from the Byzantine encyclopedia Suda: a collection of Paradoxical stories, ahistorical drama Sphinx, and an epic entitled Anthomerus; his only extant work is the Novel History, probably another title of Ptolemy's aforementioned paradoxograph-ical collection, which has been preserved as an epitome in the Bibliothecaof Patriarch Photius (c.810/820-893). By his professional pursuits, apparently initiated in his native Alexandria, Ptolemy is defined as grammaticus, i.e. classical scholar, and the classics in his time were centered primarily on Homer; the tendency to thwart this greatauthority is evident throughout the Novel Historywhich is teeming with a mass of blatantly unor-thodox versions of various mythological stories going back to Homer. It is this unortho-doxy that the compiler of the epitome finds attractive, though unfortunately a mere summary forestalls the possibility to savour the presumed stylistic complexity of the work, as well as to form a well-grounded judgement on how serious was its author's atti-tude to the fibs he tells, or on how close these fanciful rehashes cameto a deliberate par-ody; still, it almost seems certain that the original text was truly rich in playfulness, irony, and burgeoning imagination. The publication presents the first full Russian translation of the work, accompanied with sufficiently detailedcommentary, paying special attention to Eustathius' of Thessalonica (c.1115-1195/6) Commentariato Homeric poems, the only literary source where some few parallels to the wildly unconventional data provided by Ptolemy may be found.

TI Grease in the Nucleus: Insights into the Dynamic Life of Nuclear
   Membranes
SO JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE BIOLOGY
AB Nucleus is at the center stage of cellular drama orchestrated in the life of a cell and the nucleoplasm is surrounded by a double membranous compartment constituting the Nuclear membrane/envelope (NE) that separates it from the cytoplasm in nucleated cells. The initial understanding of the NE was that of a border security entity between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, separating gene regulation and transcription in the nucleus from translation in the cytoplasm. However, the discovery of a wide array of inherited diseases caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins that reside or interact with NE diverted the interest into deciphering the lipid-protein-rich environment of the NE. Today, the NE is considered a dynamic organelle which forms a functional linkage between the nucleus and the rest of the cell. The exposure of NE to constant mechanical constraints by its connectivity to the large polymer network of the lamina and chromatin on one side, and to the cytoskeleton on the other side results, in a variety of shape changes. We discuss two such deformation, the formation of nuclear blebs and nucleoplasmic reticulum (NER). Although the protein and the lipid composition of NE comprises a small fraction of the total lipid-protein load of the cell, the ability to define the lipid-protein composition of Inner nuclear membrane (INM) and Outer nuclear membrane (ONM) with precision is crucial for obtaining a deeper mechanistic understanding of their lipid-protein interaction and the various signaling pathways that are triggered by them. In addition, this allows us to further understand the direct and indirect roles of NE machinery in the chromosomal organization and gene regulation.

TI Evaluating parents' reactions to Children's stuttering using a Persian
   version of reaction to Speech Disfluency Scale
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY
AB Objectives: Stuttering is one of the most common speech disorders with many negative effects on children and their parents. The parents play a very important role in the treatment and management of children's stuttering. The parents' reactions to children's stuttering are pivotal in the exacerbation or improvement of stuttering. The present study aimed to investigate the parents' reactions to their children's stuttering using the Persian version of Reaction to Speech Disfluency Scale (RSDS).
   Methods: The present study was conducted in two stages; phase 1: translation and cultural adaptation of RSDS into Persian and phase 2: investigation of the reaction of parents to children's stuttering using the RSDS. The first phase of the study included the following steps, forward translation, backward translation, content validity, face validity, and reliability of the scale using internal consistency and test-retest reliability. The second phase of the study was to examine the reactions of 110 parents of 3-6-year-old children who stutter by using the RSDS. Data were analyzed using SPSS software.
   Results: The results of translation and cultural adaptation of the RSDS showed that the Persian version of RSDS has suitable validity. The internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.94) and the test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.98) were also appropriate for this scale. The most reactions of parents to children's stuttering were cognitive, emotional, and behavioral, respectively. The results of evaluating the maternal and paternal reactions separately indicated that the highest value of paternal reaction score was cognitive, behavioral and emotional reactions, respectively, while the highest value of maternal reaction score was cognitive, emotional and behavioral reactions, respectively. Differences between fathers and mothers were statistically significant only in emotional reaction subscale (P < 0.001). The mean overall score of the RSDS for all parents was 29, as well as 27.72 and 30.27 in fathers and mothers groups, respectively, but this differences between groups not statistically significant (P = 0.12). Comparing the scores between parents of boys and girls who stutter showed that the mean overall scores of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral subscales, and overall scores in the parents of girls who stutter was higher than in the parents of boys who stutter, and this difference was statistically significant in the emotional subscale and the overall score between the two groups (P < 0.05).
   Conclusion: The parental cognitive and behavioral reactions to children's stuttering had the maximum and minimum frequency, respectively. The paternal reactions to their children's stuttering were different from maternal reactions. The parents of girls who stutter in all subscales had a greater reaction compared to the parents of boys who stutter. Given the importance of the reactions of parents to their children's stuttering, the results of the present study can help to complete the information of therapists and researchers in this field.

TI Minerva's Hat and the Emperor's Tailcoat: August Adelburg's Cosmopolitan
   "National Opera" Zrinyi
SO STUDIA MUSICOLOGICA
AB Born to a Croatian father in Constantinople and educated in Vienna, August Adelburg (1830-1873) was a true cosmopolitan. His explicitly "national opera" about Miklos Zrinyi (c1508-1566), a Hungarian national hero of Croatian origins, was premiered in Hungarian translation on 23 June 1868 in the National Theater in Pest. The libretto (originally in German, and adapted by the composer from a drama by Theodor Korner) includes a preface that adumbrates a wholesale theory of cosmopolitanized national opera, as it were. Elaborating his views as expressed in his 1859 essay against Liszt's On the Gypsies and their music in Hungary, Adelburg insists that the hegemony of the three traditional musical styles-German, French, and Italian-is obsolete, since "the tones have a single expressive language, which is divided into as many dialects as there are musical nations in the world." At the same time, he also considers the overly use of less "worn-out" national styles misguided, since letting each character sing in the same manner is like "putting a Parisian lady's hat, instead of an antique helmet, on Minerva's head, and dressing the Roman emperors in black tailcoat, rather than sagum." Therefore, a truly up-to-date national opera must in fact be "cosmopolitan" (Adelburg himself uses the term) in its sensitive portrayal of each individual character. Following a brief analysis of some of the most prominent "national" numbers of the work, I conclude by suggesting that Adelburg's ideas about "cosmopolitanizing the national" render his Zrinyi a kind of mediator between two outstanding Hungarian operas of the period: Mihaly Mosonyi's "all-Hungarian" Szep Ilon (1861), and Ferenc Erkel's "cosmopolitan" Brankovics Gyorgy (1874).

TI Y-box binding protein 1-A prognostic marker and target in tumour therapy
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY
AB Y-box binding protein 1 (YB-1) is a multifunctional protein involved in various cellular processes including both transcriptional and translational regulation of target gene expression. Significantly increased YB-1 levels have been reported in a number of human malignancies and shown to be associated with poor prognosis and disease recurrence. Indeed, YB-1 can act as a versatile oncoprotein playing an important role in tumour cell proliferation and progression. Consequently, YB-1 not only proves to be a good prognostic tumour marker, but also may be a promising emerging molecular target for the development of new therapeutical strategies. In this review, we discuss both the role of YB-1 in cancer and specifically in malignant melanoma as well as possible translations into the clinics derived thereof. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

TI MicroRNAs and lung development
SO PEDIATRIC PULMONOLOGY
AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a large group of small (approximate to 22 nucleotides), non-coding RNA sequences that are highly conserved among animals, plants and microorganisms, suggesting that microRNAs represent a highly conserved and important regulatory mechanism. They have been demonstrated to play an important role in gene regulation. Recently, miRNAs have become a major focus of interest for research in organ development. Research focusing on the potential role of microRNAs during lung development is slowly starting to emerge. A number of miRNAs have been demonstrated to play important roles during early and late lung development. Several studies have begun to profile miRNA expression at various stages of lung development and this article provides an overview of the various miRNAs that have been implicated in lung organogenesis.

TI Je suis Shakespeare: The Making of Shared Identities in France and
   Europe in Crisis
SO MULTICULTURAL SHAKESPEARE-TRANSLATION APPROPRIATION AND PERFORMANCE
AB This essay investigates the ways in which Shakespearean production speaks to France and wider European crises in 2015 and 2016. The Tempest and Romeo and Juliet were directed by Jerome Hankins and Eric Ruf respectively in December 2015 and reflected significant contemporaneous issues, including: (1) two Paris terrorist attacks which sent shock waves throughout France and Europe; (2) the belief that shared identities were under threat; (3) concerns over shifting power dynamics in Europe. The portrayal of these issues and their reception bring into question the extent to which cultural productions can help to promote social change or shape perceptions of national and pan-European events. This essay focuses on whether the plays successfully complicate binary narratives around cultural politics in a context of crises by creating alternative representations of difference and mobilities. It concludes that appropriating Shakespeare's cultural authority encourages some degree of public debate. However, the function of Shakespeare's drama remains strongly connected to its value as an agent of cultural, political and commercial mobility, ultimately making it difficult radically to challenge ideologies.

TI Cloning and expression analysis of the DEAD-box/RNA helicase Oslaf-1 in
   Ovomermis sinensis
SO PLOS ONE
AB Ovomermis sinensis is a potentially-valuable nematode for controlling insect pests. The parasitic stage of the nematode absorbs nutrients in its host's hemolymph to maintain its growth development and then kills the host when it emerges. At present, little known about its reproductive development, particularly the responsible molecular mechanism. More detailed research on the genes of reproductive development will not only help us understand the mechanisms underlying sex differentiation in the nematode, but would also be valuable for successfully cultivating them in vitro and using them for biocontrol. In this study, we used the homology cloning method to clone the full-length cDNA of a DEAD-box family gene (Oslaf-1) from O. sinensis. Then, using qRT-PCR technology to detect the expression pattern of the Oslaf-1 gene at different development stages and tissues, the gene was found to be highly expressed in the post-parasitic stage (P < 0.01) and ovarian (P < 0.05) of O. sinensis. Western blot analysis showed the same result that the gene is associated with gonadal development and function, but is not gonad-specific. In situ hybridization further demonstrated that the gene is widely expressed in early embryos and is mainly distributed in the gonadal area. However, the signal was mainly concentrated in the reproductive primordia in pre-parasitic juveniles. RNA interference (RNAi) studies revealed that the sex ratio of O. sinensis soaked in dsRNA of Oslaf-1 was not statistically different than the gfp dsRNA treated groups. Our results suggest that Oslaf-1 may play a vital role in the reproductive systems of the nematode. In addition, we speculate that the Oslaf-1 gene plays an important role during embryonic development and that it occurs and develops in the gonads of pre-parasitic juveniles of O. sinensis.

TI John Tyrrell - Leading Janacek's Biographer and Editor
SO MUSICOLOGICA BRUNENSIA
AB Professor John Tyrrell is one of the leading musicologists specializing in Czech music and most importantly in the composer Leos Janacek. Tyrrell died on 4 October 2018.
   His interest in Janacek finds expression in several scholarly spheres. The first analyses Janaek's dramatic compositions, the second involves studies in history and historiography - however, these often permeate the analysis. Further spheres include translations of crucial sources to English, compiling the catalogue of Janacek's works, editorial and promotional work.
   The analytic sphere's important item is the author's dissertation of 1968 on Janacek's Stylistic Development as an Operatic Composer as Evidenced in his Revisions of the First Five Operas. Here he studies Janacek's dramaturgic attitude to the music drama. It was already in this study when Tyrrell noticed a certain autonomy of singing and the orchestra. Part of this issue was also expressed in the study O pripojovoni slova k hudbe v Janackovych operach (On Attachment of Words to Music in JanRek's Operas). This was followed by the outstanding text Janacek and the Speech-Melody-Myth of 1971 where he answerd the question if it is true that in Janacek's music everything grows up of the speech melodies.
   Tyrrell's historical texts include the extensive study on the Excursion of Mr. Broucek to the Moon (1969). It was the first relevant text on the issue of problems concerning this opera. Also Tyrrell's opus magnum mustn't be omitted: he worked on it for many years and made good use here of his lifelong experience and knowledge of Janacek's life and works. It is the two-volume Janacek: Years of a Life. It is a truly brilliant monograph, built on deep knowledge of different documents, literature and period conditions. It could hardly be surpassed.
   The important published translations fulfill Tyrrell's wish to provide the English speaking scholars with basic sources.
   A solitary work, however fundamental, is the thematic catalogue of Janacek's works, both musical and literary: Janacek's Works. A Catalogue of the Music and Writings of Lea Janacek.
   Editiorial work was also crucial: together with the conductor Charles Mackerras, they prepared the editions of operas Jenufa (Brno version of 1908) and From the House of the Dead.
   John Tyrrell is certainly one of the leading musicologists in history. His interest in Janacek makes him a fundamental Janacek scholar, together with professors Vladimir Helfert and Bohumir Stedron.

TI The nuclear-encoded plastid ribosomal protein L18s are essential for
   plant development
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB Plastid ribosomal proteins (PRPs) are necessary components for plastid ribosome biogenesis, playing essential roles in plastid development. The ribosomal protein L18 involved in the assemble of 5S rRNA and 23S rRNA, is vital for E. coli viability, but the functions of its homologs in plant plastid remain elusive. Here, we characterized the functions of the plant plastid ribosomal protein L18s (PRPL18s) in Arabidopsis and rice. AtPRPL18 was ubiquitously expressed in most of the plant tissues, but with higher expression levels in seedling shoots, leaves, and flowers. AtPRPL18 was localized in chloroplast. Genetic and cytological analyses revealed that a loss of function of AtPRPL18 resulted in embryo development arrest at globular stage. However, overexpression of AtPRPL18 did not show any visible phenotypical changes in Arabidopsis. The rice OsPRPL18 was localized in chloroplast. In contrast to AtPRPL18, knockout of OsPRPL18 did not affect embryo development, but led to an albino lethal phenotype at the seedling stage. Cytological analyses showed that chloroplast development was impaired in the osprpl18-1 mutant. Moreover, a loss-function of OsPRPL18 led to defects in plastid ribosome biogenesis and a serious reduction in the efficiency of plastid intron splicing. In all, these results suggested that PRPL18s play critical roles in plastid ribosome biogenesis, plastid intron splicing, and chloroplast development, and are essential for plant survival.

TI Why theatre-based research works? Psychological theories from behind the
   curtain
SO QUALITATIVE RESEARCH IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB While many scholars have demonstrated the effectiveness of theatre-based knowledge mobilization, fewer studies have examined its psychological dimensions. This article examines some psychological theories that may account for the success behind theatre-based knowledge mobilization. Drawing from the Canadian Experience Project, a study about the labor market challenges of skilled immigrant workers, we show how theatre-based research dissemination efforts attempt to achieve optimal stress by using aesthetic distance processes. We maintain that this psychological capacity to attune to audience members, especially evident in forum theatre, makes theatre a particularly effective means for knowledge mobilization.

TI Dynamics expression of DmFKBP12/Calstabin during embryonic early
   development of Drosophila melanogaster
SO CELL AND BIOSCIENCE
AB BackgroundCalcium signaling are conserved from invertebrates to vertebrates and plays critical roles in many molecular mechanisms of embryogenesis and postnatal development. As a critical component of the signaling pathway, the RyR medicated calcium-induced calcium release signaling system, has been well studied along with their regulator FK506-binding protein 12 (FKBP12/Calstabin). Lack of FKBP12 is known to result in lethal cardiac dysfunction in mouse. However, precisely how FKBP12 is regulated and effects calcium signaling in Drosophila melanogaster remains largely unknown.ResultsIn this study, we identified both temporal and localization changes in expression of DmFKBP12, a translational and transcriptional regulator of Drosophila RyR (DmRyR) and FKBP12, through embryonic development. DmFKBP12 is first expressed at the syncytial blastoderm stage and undergoes increased expression during the cellular blastoderm and early gastrulation stages. At late gastrulation, DmFKBP12 expression begins to decline until it reaches homeostasis, which it then maintains throughout the rest of development. Throughout these described changes in expression, DmFKBP12 mRNA remain stable, which indicates that protein dynamics are attributed to regulation at the mRNA to protein translation level. In addition to temporal changes in expression, dynamic expression profiles during Drosophila development also revealed DmFKBP12 localization. Although DmFKBP12 is distributed evenly between the anterior to posterior poles of the blastoderm egg, the protein is expressed more strongly in the cortex of the early Drosophila gastrula with the highest concentration found in the basement membrane of the cellular blastoderm. Fertilized egg, through the profile as under-membrane cortex distribution concentering onto basement at cellular blastoderm, to the profile as three-gem layer localization in primitive neuronal and digestion architecture of early Drosophila gastrula. By late gastrulation, DmFKBP12 is no longer identified in the yolk or lumen of duct structures and has relocated to the future brain (suboesophageal and supraesophageal ganglions), ventral nervous system, and muscular system. Throughout these changes in distribution, in situ DmFKBP12 mRNA monitoring detected equal distribution of DmFKBP12 mRNA, once again indicating that regulation of DmFKBP12 occurs at the translational level in Drosophila development.ConclusionAs a critical regulator of the DmRyR-FKBP complex, DmFKBP12 expression in Drosophila fluctuates temporally and geographically with the formation of organ systems. These finding indicate that DmFKBP12 and RyR associated calcium signaling plays an essential role in the successful development of Drosophila melanogaster. Further study on the differences between mammalian RyR-FKBP12 and Drosophila DmRyR-FKBP12 can be exploited to develop safe pesticides.

TI CUG-binding protein 1 (CUGBP1) expression and prognosis of non-small
   cell lung cancer
SO CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY
AB Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. As CUGBP1 may also play a great role in tumor genesis and deterioration, the purpose of this study was to detect the expression of CUGBP1 mRNA and CUGBP1 and assess the prognostic significance of CUGBP1 in NSCLC.
   Expression of CUGBP1 mRNA and CUGBP was detected by Semi-quantitative PCR and Immunohistochemistry, respectively, from 57 NSCLC patients. The percentage of CUGBP1 mRNA and CUGBP1 expression was correlated with clinical characteristics using chi (2) test. The prognostic significance was assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses in the Cox hazard model.
   The expression of CUGBP1 mRNA and CUGBP1 was over-expressed in cancer group and was correlated with TNM stage and Differentiation. By both univariate and multivariate survival analyses, CUGBP1 expression (P = 0.0074, HR = 3.701, 95 % CI 1.420-9.648), TNM-stage (HR = 4.043, 95 % CI 2.098-7.794) and age (HR = 3.207, 95 % CI 1.544-6.664) were noted to be independent indicators of a shorter postsurgical survival.
   The expression of CUGBP1 independently predicted a shorter postsurgical survival in NSCLC.

TI "POETICS AT THE CROSSROADS": SERBIAN POSTMODERN LITERATURE BEFORE AND
   AFTER 1989 IN SLOVAKIA: THE SPECIAL CASE OF DANILO KIS (1935 - 1989)
SO FOLIA LINGUISTICA ET LITTERARIA
AB The aim of our paper is to present the general reception of the creative life and literary works of Danilo Kis in Slovakia against the background of Serbian postmodernity. We want to do this in connection with the milestone year 1989 (the date of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Velvet Revolution in Slovakia, but also the year of the author's death), which unfortunately did not live in a dream of democracy in Central or Southeastern Europe. Finally, it is symbolic that D. Kis's works were relatively well-known and well received in the territory of the former Czechoslovakia, and were translated both before and after 1989, while professional general reflection on his works is increasing, especially since the 1990s, when several literary theoreticians and critics have returned to his life and creative messages with sympathy. However, we will go in medias res and present all the registered responses to the topic. The approach chosen will not be chronological, the order of these considerations will be involuntary, but in the end we will also offer a bibliographical list of all translated works from Serbian postmodern literature in the Slovak language from 1989 to 2019 in alphabetical order. It is a list of translated novels, collections of short stories, poetry selections and dramas by contemporary Serbian writers, which have been adapted by several Slovak translators. The corpus of these translated works from Serbian literature into Slovak after 1989 is therefore not only welcome, but perhaps also fully accepted. In Slovakia, some opinions of contemporary Serbian scholars and writers are available in Slovak on the life and overall literary work of D. Kis, who commented on his poetics and gradually their texts have been translated into Slovak over time. In almost all the postmodern works translated from Serbian into Slovak, several common tendencies can be observed. In their texts, Serbian postmodernists behave mostly subversively towards the literary tradition, constructing or rather deconstructing prose, drama or poems according to the theoretical principles of postmodernism. Their basic authorial gestures, which at first sounded ridiculous and too provocative in the (former) Yugoslav literature, did not change significantly during the 1990s, but rather settled. The source of the effect of "ambiguity" is the application of intertextuality, which is present in the texts both very directly and more discreetly. It is associated not only with the use of stylistically different speeches, but also literally different languages. Intertextual continuity within the texts takes place both at the level of their linguistic and compositional construction: the authors use the evocative power of those elements and (subject) procedures that can be considered symptomatic and constitutive for the poetics of various genres. These include the application and use of a characteristic set of motives, a familiar plot, a characteristic and readable story stereotypes, as well as the choice of realities or a typical way of naming characters. The feeling of fragmentation of the text is further strengthened by the self-referentiality of their works. This manifests itself in the narrative itself as commenting on, interpreting, and even questioning what has already been written. Their texts behave parodically and, as they relate to several prototypes at the same time, they are actually conceived as sets of intertext links. In their context, intertextual continuity ranges for some writers from citations to persiflare imitations of the genre as such.
   The degree of mirroring of the original text varies in them, or it cannot be accurately estimated. The individual text units partially comply with, they imitate the compositional rules and the form of the original texts, thus seemingly taking over or rather evoking their own genre affiliation. Their texts thus contain a false, because ambiguous and multiple, set of instructions for self-reading and decoding, which they then present to the reader. Of course, this will gradually prove to be misleading, although not unnecessary: only and against the background of the announced similarity with the original text (or imitated genre) can we perceive the "inaccuracies" that the authors commit towards it and against the instructive reading expectations. Thus, the genre "hybridity" is not only a means for them, but precisely the goal of the author's statement. It seems that the authors are trying to multiply the opacity of the textual situation in various ways, and they are far from aiming at a solution, but rather at deepening the original "mystery". In terms of the story, the "sacred" and key category of the narrator / protagonist / lyrical subject is also the subject of authorial interventions. It turns out that the chosen form of stylization is the starting point of the author's manipulation of the story. Thus, this way of reading really becomes an individual update of the text (on the author's part, perhaps its own implementation of the concept of "open work"), but at the same time admits its own incompleteness, because it is limited by personal reading experience. This statement therefore confirms the full competence of the author in dealing with both their own and the foreign text, because the scope of this manipulation is not "controllable". A paradoxical situation arises in the type of writing represented in Serbian postmodern literature by several translated authors. On the one hand, the strong position of the author is obvious, who appropriates the text and reserves the complete right to deal with it, but on the other hand, this very gesture confirms his dependence on the already existing originals. Creativity here then basically does not go beyond paraphrase, so there is a certain creative helplessness hidden behind the absolute authorial competence. This is demonstrated by the fact that a seemingly unpredictable violation of the rules of the story and genre settles down text after text. This is due to the fact that the author's poetics actually has only a limited inventory of (de)compositional procedures that relate to pre-existing epic structures. Only against their background can his texts be "generated". Arbitrariness in dealing with the original text is finally confronted with the stereotypes of the author's gesture. So, it is a canonization of a certain kind of postmodern "mess" and the authors' complete submission to its rules. In this context, it can be said that the 1990s also bring a different understanding of creative autonomy within a social context. While within the "line of ironies" that can be traced back to the 1960s, the message of the text as a means of creative self-realization and reporting on the authenticity of the individual in opposition to totalitarianism is essential. Writing in the 1990s often only seeks to express isolation as a subject and its distance from social reality. In such circumstances, when writing refers only to the world of texts, then the autonomy of literature really takes place precisely as its " exclusion from social reality".
   And remaining within the boundaries of the literary game, the authors finally give up not only any aspirations to transcend them towards the social context, but also the ethical transcendence of their own text within it. In the changed political and social situation after 1989, when literature lost the need to profile itself against the pressure of totalitarian ideology, the individual elements of postmodern poetics, which in the context of the clearly bipolar situation of the previous period sounded like an alternative or a kind of controversy, are confused. The result of this situation is a certain resignation on the part of several young authors in the 1990s: "young prose" mostly separates not only from ideological contexts, but also gives up the search for human, ethical values. The function of creating acting as messages about them loses its relevance. As a consequence, this fact led to a radical change in the perception of the social status of the book. It ceased to be initially understood as a thesaurus of values, and was declared a commodity. In the post-revolution period of the 1990s, "outsourcing" also acquired a new quality. From as early as the 1990s, it was no longer a matter of "outsiders" as a position of the marginalized subject in relation to the official centre. This was a position that would be an opposition alternative to totalitarianism. "Outsourcing" after 1989 is no longer a form of the author's forced "non- social" existence, but rather the result of a chosen text stylization. It can be seen as a tightening from the new reality, as a form of asylum created through text. Thus, it can be said that the passivity or declared "outsiders" of the protagonists, who strive for consistent, at least verbal isolation from the surrounding profanity. In the writing of some authors of the 1990s it becomes a manifestation of the subject's problematic relationship with the world, or even a specific expression of social frustration. We observe the specific use of the past tense in cases where the past character of the event or experience is particularly emphasized, when it is said to be the product of the reflexive mood of the narrator / protagonist / lyrical subject who remembers and renews his past. Here, the preterial forms of verbs, the witnessing position of the speaker, the many adverbs of place and time reinforce the idea of the authenticity of what happened. The created illusion of the reality of the narrated experiences blurs the clear line between reality and fiction, questions the past, what has already ended, and gives the perspective of its new meaning. The question of when the past ends and to what extent it is an integral part of what seeps into the present has an important role to play in clarifying the status of the stories being told. To what extent is returning in fact a natural state of reinterpretation, born of an intellectual approach to oneself and the world. Thus, the imaginary past is present with the real at a level that is its living and real necessity. A look at a specific or dreamy past experience is also an admission of the individualizing character of memory, it is an attempt at self-identification. The positions of narrator / protagonist / lyrical subject and hero agree in the search for the intersection between the narrator and the surviving self. These works seemed to be born in an attempt to combine two different ways of seeing. The emphasis was not so much on what "happened then," but on the need to make sense of it now.
   Thus, the signal of attributing certain events to the past is not a reason to ask whether the fictional past is behind the real past, but to turn to the present, which deals with the idea of what happened. The demand of the past puts us in front of the way it is presented and becomes necessary. This compositional and narrative model separates the foreign past in individual narration by one's own narrator, whose language and actions remain relatively free within the narration that presents them. The absence of commentary, and a partial ambiguity in what happened, makes the works ambiguous. Not engaging in a foreign past is a unique answer to the question of the extent to which the other's experiences belong to the main narrator / protagonist / lyrical subject. Placing one narrative in another presents the idea of the outer (introductory) text and the inner (secondary). This compositional approach helps to apply complex functionality - not in opposition to the notion of reality, but as born of the world of fiction that preceded it. The encounter with the past functions as the main centre of gravity, the survivors are told as if already completed, the heroes see it in its completion and complexity. They turn to him, not to change him, but to argue their present, but it is a present without perspective. These different approaches to dealing with the past bring its relative completion to the scene in different ways. They model the human personality in relation to what happened and what persists in memory. A dynamic relationship to the past not only conditions its integration into the present, but also reflects man's relationship to the world around him and within it. We only have to hope that the new development of Slovak-Serbian literary and cultural relations in the years before us will also bring new values that will broaden our intellectual horizons and thus enrich the spiritual dimensions of the wider reading public.

TI Life cycle assessment and economic analysis of the electric motorcycle
   in the city of Barcelona and the impact on air pollution
SO SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB In this work, the evaluation of the life cycle of the service provided by a medium-power motorcycle in a Spanish urban environment was carried out, comparing two motorcycles, a battery electric vehicle (BEV) is compared with an internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV). The economic study of the total costs of ownership is also carried out considering the environmental costs associated with each type of vehicle. A comprehensive inventory is compiled for both vehicles (motorcycles) that describes the most relevant components and includes two types of batteries for the BEV. A sensitivity analysis of the most impactful parameters is also considered. The results indicate that the ICEV contributes approximately 5 times more in the global warming potential impact category mainly due to the consumption of fossil fuels. The BEV also impacts some categories in the manufacturing stage, a fact that is strongly related to the battery. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the total distance travelled plays an important role, but the electricity mix is probably the most relevant factor in terms of climate change impact category. The economic analysis reported lower environmental externality costs for the BEV, making it more affordable than the ICEV and highlighting the benefit in terms of air pollution. The BEV is presented as a suitable option vehicle from environmental and economic point of view and one of the actors to accelerate the transition towards a more sustainable urban mobility model.

TI The Bio- and Geopolitics of Rooms
SO RELACIONES INTERNACIONALES-MADRID
AB The initiating focus of "The Bio-and Geopolitics of Rooms" is a comparison of different "metageographies: states, cities and rooms. Focusing on the smallest entities, the essay goes on to an analysis of the geo-and biopolitics of a wide variety of rooms. The analysis begins with a treatment of a geniza, a synagogue storage room in Cairo, whose contents became the basis of both a scholarly and novelistic recovery of a social and economic history. It's a history that maps an ancient trading route. Inspired by the historical study, the novel version invents characters to animate that history with a semi-fictional story that offers a view of mundane lives involved in ancient trading practices.
   The diverse readings of rooms presume a temporal rather than structural perspective in which, heeding the insights of the architectural theorist, Bernard Tschumi, buildings are understood as event spaces. With that as a primary conceptual orientation, the analysis moves to the text at the center of the article, a novel focused on supermundane lives. Associated with famous architectural event, the architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's. design of a home (in the 1920s) for a wealthy Jewish family in Brno, Czechoslovakia, the novel, Simon Mawer's The Glass Room, turns the home's featured room into a protagonist that ultimately hosts a variety of occupants. After an extended analysis of the Mawer novel, in which the room's history includes its use as a biogenetic laboratory by invading Nazis (a theme picked up later in the essay's textual montage), the article turns to an analysis of private rooms, beginning with a treatment of the sitting room in the home ofTurkish writer Orhan Pamuk's grandmother, for whom the room was a museum curated to represent her Kemalist/western allegiance. That treatment of a private space is followed by a description of the semiotics of rooms belonging to Russian emigres whose rooms express the complicated bi-national identities.
   Following a focus on those rooms is a turn to a novel by the Peruvian Jose Maria Arguedas whose writing in Spanish but with the syntax of Peru's indigenous Quechuan language was a result of his childhood confinement to a kitchen among indigenous servants. The novel is a compositional critique of Creole dominance. Like Pamuk's grandmother's sitting room, the kitchen in which Arguedas dwelled as a child distilled a larger world down to a room with hard boundaries, in his case a world of colonial dominance registered in a spatio-temporal history through which much of the indigenous Andean population of Peru had been reduced to servitude.
   As the analysis shifts to public rooms, the focus is on courtrooms in which the trials involve war crimes prosecutions. The first one is featured in Mathias Enard's novel Zone, which begins with his protagonist, a reformed Croatian militiaman is reporting on his witnessing of the trial of his former commander. The report describes what the protagonist calls a "a multilingual circus of the ICJ," involving multiple participants, among which are jurors, knowledge agents from diverse academic disciplines, and media people, all contributing to the interpretations that constitute the will-have-been of the crimes perpetrated by the defendant, who stands in for the crimes of many.The focus then continues on courtrooms, the next of which is featured in Michel Foucault's analysis of "criminal danger," in which, analyzing a moment of interrogation that takes place in a nineteenth century French courtroom, he refers to the historical emergence of "the criminal" as an object of juridical attention (whereas prior to the mid nineteenth century, the focus was on crimes and penalties).
   That textual analysis is followed by a reading of a novel that features an unnamed protagonist in Katie Kitamura's appropriately entitled novel Intimacies, who serves as a translator at the trail of a former African president who has been brought to The Hague after being charged with war crimes. The novel's courtroom drama focuses on the struggle by the translator to make the space between languages as small as possible in order to manage the linguistic demands of reliable translation while at the same time managing an uncomfortable intimacy with a man whose crimes she views as abhorrent.
   That trial room is contrasted with one in Hugo Blick's eight-part Netflix series Black Earth Rising, which treats those geopolitical forces far more elaborately than they are in Kitamura's novel. To frame Blick's courtroom drama, the analysis turns to Shoshana Felman's distinction between 'literary justice," a dimension of concrete embodiment and a language of finitude, which contrasts with legal justice, a framing that is also applied to the amnesty trials ordered by South Africa's "Truth and Reconciliation Commission," Gillian Slovo's novelistic version, in her Red Dust, of one such trial is focused on an interpersonal encounter in the trail room between a torturer and his victim.
   The article ends with an analysis of Arthur Miller's play, a one room drama featuring a group of jews and suspected jews rounded up in Vichy France during the Nazi occupation. The drama treats their interactions as they are sitting in a police station waiting their interrogations. The play is described as remarkably Sartrean in the way its scenario mirrors one in Sartre's story "The Wall," which begins with a roundup and interrogation of suspected "anarchists" (Popular Front activists associated with the Spanish Civil War): In the charged rooms of his situation dramas Sartre exercises a phenomenology of choice in which his protagonists effectively choose themselves, performing an agency that moves them from the concrete presence with which they enter the drama to a possibility of personhood that extends well beyond the particular situation. They are involved in actions that are as much events of ethical self-discovery and self-making as they are the acceptances of responsibility to alterity. Similarly, Miller's room is also a space of self-discovery, which he intends to be taken as a general lesson; it's not "about Nazism," he says in a reflection about his play, but about "our individual relationship with injustice." "Incident at Vichy," he adds, "has been called a play whose theme is 'Am I my brother's keeper?' Not so, 'Am I my own keeper?' is more correct.

TI Roles of MEF2A and MyoG in the transcriptional regulation of bovine
   LATS2 gene
SO RESEARCH IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
AB As an important downstream effector gene in the hippo signaling pathway, large tumor suppressor gene 2 (LATS2) is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation, organ size and tissue regeneration, and plays an important role in regulating the growth and development of animal muscles. The purpose of this study is to explore the temporal expression of bovine LATS2 gene, and determine the key transcription factors for regulating bovine LATS2 gene. The result showed that bovine LATS2 gene was highly expressed in liver and longissimus dorsi, and was up-regulated in infancy muscle. In addition, it was highly expressed on the 2th day during the differentiation stage of myoblast. The upstream 1.7 Kb sequence of the 5 'translation region of bovine LATS2 gene was cloned, and 7 different deletion fragments were amplified by the upstream primers. These fragments were constructed into double luciferase reporter vectors and transfected into myoblasts and myotubes cells, respectively to detect the core promoter regions. In addition, the key transcription factors of the core promoter sequence of the bovine LATS2 gene were analyzed and predicted by online software. Combining with site -directed mutations, siRNA interference and chromatin immunoprecipitation technology, it was identified that MEF2A and MyoG combined in core promoter region (-248/-56) to regulate the transcription activity of bovine LATS2 gene. The results have laid a theoretical foundation for exploring the molecular regulation mechanism of LATS2 gene in the process of muscle growth.

TI Fine regulation of ARF17 for anther development and pollen formation
SO BMC PLANT BIOLOGY
AB Background: In Arabidopsis, the tapetum and microsporocytes are critical for pollen formation. Previous studies have shown that ARF17 is expressed in microsporocytes and tetrads and directly regulates tetrad wall synthesis for pollen formation. ARF17 is the direct target of miR160, and promoterARF17::5mARF17 (5mARF17/WT) transgenic plants, which have five silent mutations within the miR160-complementary domain, are sterile.
   Results: Here, we found that ARF17 is also expressed in the tapetum, which was defective in arf17 mutants. Compared with arf17 mutants, 5mARF17/WT plants had abnormal tapetal cells and tetrads but were less vacuolated in the tapetum. Immunocytochemical assays showed that the ARF17 protein over-accumulated in tapetum, microsporocytes and tetrads of 5mARF17/WT plants at early anther stages, but its expression pattern was not affected during anther development. 5mARF17 driven by its native promoter did not rescue the arf17 male-sterile phenotype. The expression of 5mARF17 driven by the tapetum-specific promoter A9 led to a defective tapetum and male sterility in transgenic plants. These results suggest that the overexpression of ARF17 in the tapetum and microsporocytes of 5mARF17/WT plants leads to male sterility. Microarray data revealed that an abundance of genes involved in transcription and translation are ectopically expressed in 5mARF17/WT plants.
   Conclusions: Our work shows that ARF17 plays an essential role in anther development and pollen formation, and ARF17 expression under miR160 regulation is critical for its function during anther development.

TI Integrated high-throughput analysis identifies super enhancers in
   metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer
SO FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
AB Background: Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is a highly aggressive stage of prostate cancer, and non-mutational epigenetic reprogramming plays a critical role in its progression. Super enhancers (SE), epigenetic elements, are involved in multiple tumor-promoting signaling pathways. However, the SE-mediated mechanism in mCRPC remains unclear.Methods: SE-associated genes and transcription factors were identified from a cell line (C4-2B) of mCRPC by the CUT&Tag assay. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between mCRPC and primary prostate cancer (PCa) samples in the GSE35988 dataset were identified. What's more, a recurrence risk prediction model was constructed based on the overlapping genes (termed SE-associated DEGs). To confirm the key SE-associated DEGs, BET inhibitor JQ1 was applied to cells to block SE-mediated transcription. Finally, single-cell analysis was performed to visualize cell subpopulations expressing the key SE-associated DEGs.Results: Nine human TFs, 867 SE-associated genes and 5417 DEGs were identified. 142 overlapping SE-associated DEGs showed excellent performance in recurrence prediction. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed strong predictive power at 1 year (0.80), 3 years (0.85), and 5 years (0.88). The efficacy of his performance has also been validated in external datasets. In addition, FKBP5 activity was significantly inhibited by JQ1.Conclusion: We present a landscape of SE and their associated genes in mCPRC, and discuss the potential clinical implications of these findings in terms of their translation to the clinic.

TI Updates in deep learning research in ophthalmology
SO CLINICAL SCIENCE
AB Ophthalmology has been one of the early adopters of artificial intelligence (AI) within the medical field. Deep learning (DL), in particular, has garnered significant attention due to the availability of large amounts of data and digitized ocular images. Currently, AI in Ophthalmology is mainly focused on improving disease classification and supporting decision-making when treating ophthalmic diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). However, most of the DL systems (DLSs) developed thus far remain in the research stage and only a handful are able to achieve clinical translation. This phenomenon is due to a combination of factors including concerns over security and privacy, poor generalizability, trust and explainability issues, unfavorable end-user perceptions and uncertain economic value. Overcoming this challenge would require a combination approach. Firstly, emerging techniques such as federated learning (FL), generative adversarial networks (GANs), autonomous AI and blockchain will be playing an increasingly critical role to enhance privacy, collaboration and DLS performance. Next, compliance to reporting and regulatory guidelines, such as CONSORT-AI and STARD-AI, will be required to in order to improve transparency, minimize abuse and ensure reproducibility. Thirdly, frameworks will be required to obtain patient consent, perform ethical assessment and evaluate end-user perception. Lastly, proper health economic assessment (HEA) must be performed to provide financial visibility during the early phases of DLS development. This is necessary to manage resources prudently and guide the development of DLS.

TI G protein-coupled oestrogen receptor promotes cell growth of non-small
   cell lung cancer cells via YAP1/QKI/circNOTCH1/m6A methylated NOTCH1
   signalling
SO JOURNAL OF CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR MEDICINE
AB Results from various studies reveal that the role of G protein-coupled oestrogen receptor (GPER) is cancer-context dependent, and the function of GPER in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still unclear. The present study demonstrated that neoplasm lung tissues expressed higher level of GPER compared with the normal lung tissues. The clinical data also showed that GPER expression level was positively correlated with the tumour stage of NSCLC. Our experimental data confirmed that GPER played an oncogenic role to promote cell growth of NSCLC cells. Mechanistic dissection revealed that GPER could modulate the NOTCH1 pathway to regulate cell growth in NSCLC cells. Further exploration of the mechanism demonstrated that GPER could up-regulate circNOTCH1, which could compete with NOTCH1 mRNA for METTL14 binding. Because of the lack of m6A modification by METTL14 on the NOTCH1 mRNA, NOTCH1 mRNA was more stable and much easier to undergo protein translation. Subsequently, we found that GPER could prevent YAP1 phosphorylation and promote YAP1-TEAD's transcriptional regulation on QKI, a transacting RNA-binding factor involved in circRNA biogenesis, to facilitate circNOTCH1 generation. Supportively, data from preclinical mice model with implantation of H1299 cells also demonstrated that knock-down of circNOTCH1 could block GPER-induced NOTCH1 to suppress NSCLC tumour growth. Together, our data showed that GPER could promote NSCLC cell growth via regulating the YAP1/QKI/circNOTCH1/m6A methylated NOTCH1 pathway, and targeting our identified molecules may be a potentially therapeutic approach to suppress NSCLC development.

TI Frontally placed eyes versus laterally placed eyes: computational
   comparison of their functions for ego-motion estimation
SO JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA A-OPTICS IMAGE SCIENCE AND
   VISION
AB Both frontally placed eyes and laterally placed eyes are popular in nature, and although which one is better could be one of the most intuitive questions to ask, it could also be the hardest question to answer. Their most obvious difference is that, at least as supposed in the computer vision community, stereopsis plays the central role in the visual system composed of frontally placed eyes (or cameras); however, it is not available in the lateral configuration due to the lack of overlap between the visual fields. As a result, researchers have adopted completely different approaches to model the two configurations and developed computational mimics of them to address various vision problems. Recently, the advent of novel quasi-parallax conception unifies the ego-motion estimation procedure of these two eye configurations into the same framework and makes systematic comparison feasible. In this paper, we intend to establish the computational superiority of eye topography from the perspective of ego-motion estimation. Specifically, quasi-parallax is applied to fuse motion cues from individual cameras at an early stage, at the pixel level, and to recover the translation and rotation separately with high accuracy and efficiency without the need of feature matching. Furthermore, its applicability on the extended sideways arrangements is studied successfully to make our comparison more general and insightful. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real data have been done, and the computational superiority of the lateral configuration is verified. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America

TI Tolerance in liver transplantation: Biomarkers and clinical relevance
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
AB Transplantation is the optimal treatment for end-stage organ failure, and modern immunosuppression has allowed important progress in short-term outcomes. However, immunosuppression poorly influences chronic rejection and elicits chronic toxicity in current clinical practice. Thus, a major goal in transplantation is to understand and induce tolerance. It is well established that human regulatory T cells expressing the transcription factor FoxP3 play important roles in the maintenance of immunological self-tolerance and immune homeostasis. The major regulatory T cell subsets and mechanisms of expansion that are critical for induction and long-term maintenance of graft tolerance and survival are being actively investigated. Likewise, other immune cells, such as dendritic cells, monocyte/macrophages or natural killer cells, have been described as part of the process known as "operational tolerance". However, translation of these results towards clinical practice needs solid tools to identify accurately and reliably patients who are going to be tolerant. In this way, a plethora of genetic and cellular biomarkers is raising and being validated worldwide in large multi-center clinical trials. Few of the studies performed so far have provided a detailed analysis of the impact of immunosuppression withdrawal on pre-existing complications derived from the long-term administration of immunosuppressive drugs and the side effects associated with them. The future of liver transplantation is aimed to develop new therapies which increase the actual low tolerant vs non-tolerant recipients ratio.

TI MyoD and Myf6 gene expression patterns in skeletal muscle during
   embryonic and posthatch development in the domestic duck (Anas
   platyrhynchos domestica)
SO JOURNAL OF ANIMAL BREEDING AND GENETICS
AB The MyoD and Myf6 genes, which are muscle regulatory factors (MRFs), play major roles in muscle growth and development and initiate muscle fibre formation via the regulation of muscle-specific gene translation. Therefore, MyoD and Myf6 are potential candidate genes for meat production traits in animals and poultry. The objective of this study was to evaluate MyoD and Myf6 gene expression patterns in the skeletal muscle during early developmental stage of ducks. Gene expression levels were detected using the quantitative RT-PCR method in the breast muscle (BM) and leg muscle (LM) at embryonic days 13, 17, 21, 25, 27, as well as at 1week posthatching in Gaoyou and Jinding ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domestica). The MyoD and Myf6 gene profiles in the two duck breeds were consistent during early development, and MyoD gene expression showed a wave' trend in BM and an approximate anti-' trend in LM. Myf6 gene expression in BM showed the highest level at embryonic day 21, which subsequently decreased, although remained relatively high, while levels at embryonic days 13, 17 and 21 were higher in LM. The results of correlation analysis showed that MyoD and Myf6 gene expression levels were more strongly correlated in LM than in BM in both duck breeds. These results indicated that different expression patterns of the MyoD and Myf6 genes in BM and LM may be related to muscle development and differentiation, suggesting that MyoD and Myf6 are integral to skeletal muscle development.

TI Glycoproteomics revealed novel N-glycosylation biomarkers for early
   diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma cancers
SO CLINICAL PROTEOMICS
AB Circulating biomarkers play important roles in diagnosis of malignant tumors. N-glycosylation is an important post-translation patter and obviously affect biological behaviors of malignant tumor cells. However, the role of N-glycosylation sites in early diagnosis of tumors still remains further investigation. In this study, plasma from 20 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), which were all classified as stage I, as well as 20 normal controls (NL) were labeled and screened by mass spectrometry (MS). Total 39 differential N-glycosylation sites were detected in LUAD, 17 were up-regulated and 22 were down-regulated. In all differential sites, ITGB3-680 showed highest potential in LUAD which showed 99.2% AUC, 95.0% SP and 95.0% SN. Besides, APOB-1523 (AUC: 89.0%, SP: 95.0%, SN: 70.0%), APOB-2982 (AUC: 86.8%, SP: 95.0%, SN: 45.0%) and LPAL2-101 (AUC: 81.1%, SP: 95.0%, SN: 47.4%) also acted as candidate biomarkers in LUAD. Combination analysis was then performed by random forest model, all samples were divided into training group (16 cases) and testing group (4 cases) and conducted by feature selection, machine learning, integrated model of classifier and model evaluation. And the results indicated that combination of differential sites could reach 100% AUC in both training and testing group. Taken together, our study revealed multiple N-glycosylation sites which could be applied as candidate biomarkers for early diagnosis diagnosis of LUAD.

TI Non-pharmacological interventions for preventing secondary vascular
   events after stroke or transient ischemic attack
SO COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB Background
   Stroke is the second leading cause of death among adults worldwide. Individuals who have suffered a stroke are at high risk of having another stroke likely leading to greater disability and institutionalization. Non-pharmacological interventions may have a role to play in averting a second stroke.
   Objectives
   To determine the effectiveness of multi-modal programs of non-pharmacological interventions compared with usual care in preventing secondary vascular events and reducing vascular risk factors after stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (September 2012); The Cochrane Library databases CENTRAL, CDSR, DARE, HTA and NHS EED (2012 Issue 2); MEDLINE (1950 to February 2012); EMBASE (1974 to February 2012); CINAHL (1982 to February 2012); SPORTDiscus (1800 to February 2012); PsycINFO (1887 to February 2012) and Web of Science (1900 to February 2012). We also searched PEDro, OT Seeker, OpenSIGLE, REHABDATA and Dissertation Abstracts (February 2012). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished and ongoing trials we searched trials registers, scanned reference lists, and contacted authors and researchers.
   Selection criteria
   We included randomized controlled trials evaluating the use of non-pharmacological interventions that included components traditionally used in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs in adults with stroke or TIA. Primary outcomes were a cluster of second stroke or myocardial infarction or vascular death. Secondary outcomes were (1) secondary vascular events: second stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular death, as well as (2) vascular risk factors: blood pressure, body weight, lipid profile, insulin resistance and tobacco use. We also recorded adverse events such as exercise-related musculoskeletal injuries or cardiovascular events.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently scanned titles and abstracts and independently screened full reports of studies that were potentially relevant. At each stage, we compared results. The two review authors resolved disagreements through discussion or by involving a third review author.
   Main results
   We identified one study, involving 48 participants, of a 10-week CR program for patients post-stroke that met the inclusion criteria. The results of this completed pilot trial show that patients post-stroke had significantly greater improvement in cardiac risk score in the CR group (13.4 +/- 10.1 to 12.4 +/- 10.5, P value < 0.05) when compared with usual care (9.4 +/- 6.7 to 15.0 +/- 6.1, P value < 0.05). In addition, five trials, which are ongoing, will likely meet the inclusion criteria for this review once completed.
   Authors' conclusions
   There is limited applicable evidence. Therefore, no implications for practice can be drawn. Further research is required and several trials are underway, the findings of which are anticipated to contribute to the body of evidence.

TI Current Status of SPECT Radiopharmaceuticals for Specific Bacteria
   Imaging
SO SEMINARS IN NUCLEAR MEDICINE
AB Imaging infection still represents a challenge for researchers. Despite nuclear medicine (NM) offers valuable tools able to discriminate between infections and inflammation, there is an unmet clinical need to develop new strategies able to specifically target the causative pathogen, to select the best antimicrobial treatment for each patient and to accurately assess therapeutic efficacy. These aspects are commonly addressed by microbiology or histology but the diagnosis often relies on invasive procedures that are prone to contamination or sample bias and do not reflect the spatial heterogeneity of the infective process. Therefore, in the era of personalized medicine and treatment, a lot of efforts are in play to improve a personalized diagnosis. Molecular imaging is an ideal candidate for this purpose and, indeed, research is going fast to this direction aiming to find more selective and proper antimicrobial treatments and to overcome broad-spectrum antibiotic use, which still represents the major cause of bacterial drug-resistance. Several approaches for specifically image bacteria have been proposed and provided encouraging perspectives in preclinical studies. Nevertheless, the majority of these promising approaches are still confined in "bench stages" and crucial issues still need to be addressed before their translation in clinical practice. This review will focus on radiolabeled antibiotics for SPECT imaging of bacteria, their mechanisms of action, their potentiality and limitations for "bed-side" applications.

TI Poly(A) polymerase 1 contributes to competence acquisition of pollen
   tubes growing through the style in Arabidopsis thaliana
SO PLANT JOURNAL
AB Polyadenylation of mRNAs is critical for their export from the nucleus, stability, and efficient translation. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes three isoforms of canonical nuclear poly(A) polymerase (PAPS) that redundantly polyadenylate the bulk of pre-mRNAs. However, previous studies have indicated that subsets of pre-mRNAs are preferentially polyadenylated by either PAPS1 or the other two isoforms. Such functional specialization raises the possibility of an additional level of gene-expression control in plants. Here we test this notion by studying the function of PAPS1 in pollen-tube growth and guidance. Pollen tubes growing through female tissue acquire the competence to find ovules efficiently and upregulate PAPS1 expression at the transcriptional, but not detectably at the protein level compared with in vitro grown pollen tubes. Using the temperature-sensitive paps1-1 allele we show that PAPS1 activity during pollen-tube growth is required for full acquisition of competence, resulting in inefficient fertilization by paps1-1 mutant pollen tubes. While these mutant pollen tubes grow almost at the wild-type rate, they are compromised in locating the micropyles of ovules. Previously identified competence-associated genes are less expressed in paps1-1 mutant than in wild-type pollen tubes. Estimating the poly(A) tail lengths of transcripts suggests that polyadenylation by PAPS1 is associated with reduced transcript abundance. Our results therefore suggest that PAPS1 plays a key role in the acquisition of competence and underline the importance of functional specialization between PAPS isoforms throughout different developmental stages.

TI Effects of ADAMTS14 genetic polymorphism and cigarette smoking on the
   clinicopathologic development of hepatocellular carcinoma
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background
   ADAMTS14 is a member of the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs), which are proteolytic enzymes with a variety of further ancillary domain in the C-terminal region for substrate specificity and enzyme localization via extracellular matrix association. However, whether ADAMTS14 genetic variants play a role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) susceptibility remains unknown.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   Four non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) of the ADAMTS14 gene were examined from 680 controls and 340 patients with HCC. Among 141 HCC patients with smoking behaviour, we found significant associations of the rs12774070 (CC+AA vs CC) and rs61573157 (CT+TT vs CC) variants with a clinical stage of HCC (OR: 2.500 and 2.767; 95% CI: 1.148-5.446 and 1.096-6.483; P = 0.019 and 0.026, respectively) and tumour size (OR: 2.387 and 2.659; 95% CI: 1.098-5.188 and 1.055-6.704; P = 0.026 and 0.034, respectively), but not with lymph node metastasis or other clinical statuses. Moreover, an additional integrated in silico analysis proposed that rs12774070 and rs61573157 affected essential post-translation O-glycosylation site within the 3rd thrombospondin type 1 repeat and a novel proline-rich region embedded within the C-terminal extension, respectively.
   Conclusions
   Taken together, our results suggest an involvement of ADAMTS14 SNP rs12774070 and rs61573157 in the liver tumorigenesis and implicate the ADAMTS14 gene polymorphism as a predict factor during the progression of HCC.

TI Emerging role of microRNA-21 in colorectal cancer
SO CANCER BIOMARKERS
AB Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common types of cancers worldwide. In spite of much progress in surgery, chemotherapy and molecular targeted therapy, the mortality rate has only decreased slightly over the past years. MicroRNAs are 18-25 nucleotide, noncoding RNA molecules that regulate the translation of many genes. Evidence suggests that miRNAs may play an important role in a variety of cellular biological processes, such as cell growth, differentiation, metabolism, invasion, angiogenesis. Recently, miR-21 is found to be aberrantly expressed in CRC and miR-21 has been recognized to perform significantly in CRC, where miR-21 can regulate several different target genes and pathways involving tumor proliferation, invasion and metastasis. In this study, we will focus on the critical role of miR-21 in CRC. Hopefully, the information obtained may lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis and development of novel therapeutic strategies for this disease.

TI Three-dimensional mesoscopic investigation on equation of state for dry
   sand under shock compression
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING
AB The dynamic behavior of dry sand subjected to intensively dynamic loads such as blasts and projectile pene-tration is a topic of current research for military protection engineering. The equation of state (EoS) plays a crucial rule under such high pressure and high strain-rate. However, experimental investigation on the EoS of dry sand with a comprehensive considerations of sand configuration, such as the particle shape, grain composition and porosity is a complex and expensive task. In the present study, a well-established three-dimensional mesoscopic model for dry sand is presented, in which the dynamic behavior of sand particle (quartz) are described by the HJC model with systematically calibrated parameters. The mesoscopic model is then used to investigate the dynamic response and EoS for dry sand subjected to shock compression and is validated against existing fly-plate-impact test data, in which two homogenization methods used to connect the mesoscopic var-iables and macroscopic EoS are adopted. A thorough analysis of the numerical shock compression simulation demonstrates that the shock compression of dry sand system can be divided into three stages, i.e., the initial rearrangement of particles, the following formation of stable force chains and the final translation motion. Finally, the effect of sand configuration on the EoS is systematically conducted. It is found that the particle shape and grain composition have limited influence on EoS, the friction between sand particles moderately influences the EoS and porosity strongly influences the EoS.

TI Targeting Akt-associated microRNAs for cancer therapeutics
SO BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY
AB The uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells because of activating protooncogenes and/or inactivating tumor suppressor genes are the hallmarks of cancer. The PI3K/Akt signaling is one of the most frequently activated pathways in cancer cells responsible for the regulation of cell survival and proliferation in stress and hypoxic conditions during oncogenesis. Non-coding RNAs are a large family of RNAs that are not involved in protein-coding, and microRNAs (miRNAs) are a sub-set of non-coding RNAs with a single strand of 18-25 nucleotides. miRNAs are extensively involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and play an extensive role in the regulatory mechanisms including cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis. The impact of cancer on mRNA stability and translation efficiency is extensive and therefore, cancerous tissues exhibit drastic alterations in the expression of miRNAs. miRNAs can be modulated by utilizing techniques such as miRNA mimics, miRNA antagonists, or CRISPR/Cas9. In addition to their capacity as potential targets in cancer therapy, they can be used as reliable biomarkers to diagnose the disease at the earliest stage. Recent evidence indicates that microRNA-mediated gene regulation intersects with the Akt pathway, forming an AktmicroRNA regulatory network. miRNAs and Akt in this network operate together to exert their cellular tasks. In the current review, we discuss the Akt-associated miRNAs in several cancers, their molecular regulation, and how this newly emerging knowledge may contribute greatly to revolutionize cancer therapy.

TI Cracking the Mysteries of "China": China(ware) in the Early Modern
   Imagination
SO STUDIES IN PHILOLOGY
AB This essay explores early modern views of China as they were expressed through European representations of Chinese porcelain. Analyzing a range of artistic, printed, and dramatic texts, I show how sixteenth- and seventeenth-century western mythologies surrounding the production of chinaware offer a striking contrast to the more denigrating discourse of chinoiserie that developed in the eighteenth century. Focusing particularly on descriptions of chinaware that circulated in early modern England, I demonstrate how writers ranging from Mandeville to Hakluyt to Shakespeare and fonson foster ideas about the mysteries of Chinese porcelain that emphasize its virtuous and magical properties. I also consider contemporary English translations of Marco Polo, the Portuguese trader Duarte Barbosa, and the Italian Jesuit Matteo Ricci, as well as Italian paintings by Andrea Mantegna and Giovanni Bellini, revealing an admiration for chinaware that circulated throughout Europe. Examining the shifting ways that commodification affected perceptions of chinaware and vice versa, I draw attention to a particular period of transition over the first half of the seventeenth century when Chinese porcelain became increasingly available to moneyed English consumers. During this time, the myths surrounding porcelain's creation were both demystified and reclaimed, while on the public stage diverse perceptions of chinaware offered a way to arbitrate social competency. Throughout, I chart an early modern discourse of chinaware in relation to an evolving history of East-West trade, revealing how the mysterious origins of Chinese porcelain both resisted and played into its commodification.

TI FEM1 proteins are ancient regulators of SLBP degradation
SO CELL CYCLE
AB FEM1A, FEM1B, and FEM1C are evolutionarily-conserved VHL-box proteins, the substrate recognition subunits of CUL2-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. Here, we report that FEM1 proteins are ancient regulators of Stem-Loop Binding Protein ( SLBP), a conserved protein that interacts with the stem loop structure located in the 30 end of canonical histone mRNAs and functions in mRNA cleavage, translation and degradation. SLBP levels are highest during S-phase coinciding with histone synthesis. The ubiquitin ligase complex SCFcyclin (F) targets SLBP for degradation in G2 phase; however, the regulation of SLBP during other stages of the cell cycle is poorly understood. We provide evidence that FEM1A, FEM1B, and FEM1C interact with and mediate the degradation of SLBP. Cyclin F, FEM1A, FEM1B and FEM1C all interact with a region in SLBP's N-terminus using distinct degrons. An SLBP mutant that is unable to interact with all 4 ligases is expressed at higher levels than wild type SLBP and does not oscillate during the cell cycle. We demonstrate that orthologues of SLBP and FEM1 proteins interact in C. elegans and D. melanogaster, suggesting that the pathway is evolutionarily conserved. Furthermore, we show that FEM1 depletion in C. elegans results in the upregulation of SLBP ortholog CDL-1 in oocytes. Notably, cyclin F is absent in flies and worms, suggesting that FEM1 proteins play an important role in SLBP targeting in lower eukaryotes.

TI Lift the curtain on long non-coding RNAs in hematological malignancies:
   Pathogenic elements and potential targets
SO CANCER LETTERS
AB The Human Genome Project in 2001 has opened the Pandora's box on the complexity of DNA structure and transcriptional regulation. Only a small fraction of the 3 billion bases is part of the protein-coding genes, while approximately 98.5% is represented by non-coding sequences. Besides the classical messenger, ribosomal and transfer RNAs, the "cellular RNA world" is made of short and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that play regulatory or structural roles, shifting the balance of pathogenic gene variations from coding to non-coding genome. LncRNAs are 200 and 100,000 nucleotide long molecules, not translated into protein, highly heterogeneous in terms of expression within the cells, showing tissue and stage specificity. They are emerging as modifiers of epigenetic, transcription, and translation processes, and can be implicated in the pathogenesis of cancers. In this review, we will focus on B, T and NK hematological malignancies, with the aim of presenting an update on lncRNAs landscape and on their role as potential oncogenes or oncosuppressors. Moreover, we will talk over the bi-directional crosstalk between lncRNAs and epigenetics since these modifications can impact on lncRNAs expression, and, in turn, non-coding transcripts can regulate chromatin organization and transcriptional processes. Finally, we will point the attention on their use as potential biomarkers for diagnostic and prognostic purposes, and possibly as attractive targets in a translational perspective, opening for novel therapeutic options.

TI Development of a cost-effective automated platform to produce human
   liver spheroids for basic and applied research
SO BIOFABRICATION
AB Liver disease represents an increasing cause of global morbidity and mortality. Currently, liver transplant is the only treatment curative for end-stage liver disease. Donor organs cannot meet the demand and therefore scalable treatments and new disease models are required to improve clinical intervention. Pluripotent stem cells represent a renewable source of human tissue. Recent advances in three-dimensional cell culture have provided the field with more complex systems that better mimic liver physiology and function. Despite these improvements, current cell-based models are variable in performance and expensive to manufacture at scale. This is due, in part, to the use of poorly defined or cross-species materials within the process, severely affecting technology translation. To address this issue, we have developed an automated and economical platform to produce liver tissue at scale for modelling disease and small molecule screening. Stem cell derived liver spheres were formed by combining hepatic progenitors with endothelial cells and stellate cells, in the ratios found within the liver. The resulting tissue permitted the study of human liver biology 'in the dish' and could be scaled for screening. In summary, we have developed an automated differentiation system that permits reliable self-assembly of human liver tissue for biomedical application. Going forward we believe that this technology will not only serve as an in vitro resource, and may have an important role to play in supporting failing liver function in humans.

TI Delayed IL-12 production by macrophages during Toxoplasma gondii
   infection is regulated by miR-187
SO PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
AB Toxoplasma gondii is an important zoonotic protozoan worldwide which infects most of warm-blooded mammals and birds, including human, and cause toxoplasmosis. As an intracellular parasite, T. gondii must evade host immune surveillance, such as IL-12 and IFN-gamma, in order to survive and multiply in macrophages and other host cells. By delaying IL-12 secretion of host macrophages within 24 h after infection, T. gondii ensures not only self-survival but also the establishment of chronic infection of host cells. MicroRNA plays an important role in regulating gene transcription and translation. The mechanisms of IL-12 production during T. gondii infection are still unknown. Thus, understanding how the parasites manipulate IL-12 production by host macrophage is critical for the effective prevention and therapy of T. gondii infection. In the present study, regulation of delayed macrophage IL-12 production during T. gondii infection was explored. We found that the production of IL-12 after T. gondii infection was inhibited during the first 24 h and then resumed. The expression pattern of miR-187 production was consistent with the production pattern of IL-12 during T. gondii infection. The downregulation of miR-187 promoted Akt and P65 phosphorylation and delayed IL-12 production at late stage (after 24 h) of T. gondii infection. Dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated that MiR-187 targeted the NFKBIZ gene. Our results suggested that the delayed IL-12 production in mouse macrophages during T. gondii infection was regulated by miR-187.

TI Tracing sources of design uncertainty and controversy in Web 2.0
   facilitated collaborative design process
SO AFRICAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB The integration of Internet-based collaborative tools such as Web 2.0 technologies to facilitate the design process has rendered collaborative design a chaotic practice filled with controversy and uncertainty, with the inevitable risk of unintended consequences. The purpose of this study was to trace the sources of design controversy in a Web 2.0 facilitated collaborative design process. The study employed an Actor Network Theory (ANT) methodological framework to explore design controversy in five design teams comprising of 4 to 6 undergraduate engineering students. Data was constituted by following the traces left by the actors, both human and nonhumans, their actions and the associations they made and broke as they worked to provide a solution to a design problem. All of these traces were captured on a Web platform. Our position was that of non-participant observers to allow the participants to speak for themselves. In addition, some key participants (spokespersons) were interviewed to allow them to explain their actions. The findings of the study demonstrate that Web 2.0 technologies played a critical role in illuminating controversies encountered during the design process from the design group formation, design problem analysis, as well as the generation and realization of the design solution stages of the process. Web 2.0 technology enabled the tracing of the rich interactions among designers which allowed the mapping of provisional ties, and the translations that made these ties durable and seemingly irreversible.

TI The Hitchhiker's Guide to Human Therapeutic Nanoparticle Development
SO PHARMACEUTICS
AB Nanomedicine plays an essential role in developing new therapies through novel drug delivery systems, diagnostic and imaging systems, vaccine development, antibacterial tools, and high-throughput screening. One of the most promising drug delivery systems are nanoparticles, which can be designed with various compositions, sizes, shapes, and surface modifications. These nanosystems have improved therapeutic profiles, increased bioavailability, and reduced the toxicity of the product they carry. However, the clinical translation of nanomedicines requires a thorough understanding of their properties to avoid problems with the most questioned aspect of nanosystems: safety. The particular physicochemical properties of nano-drugs lead to the need for additional safety, quality, and efficacy testing. Consequently, challenges arise during the physicochemical characterization, the production process, in vitro characterization, in vivo characterization, and the clinical stages of development of these biopharmaceuticals. The lack of a specific regulatory framework for nanoformulations has caused significant gaps in the requirements needed to be successful during their approval, especially with tests that demonstrate their safety and efficacy. Researchers face many difficulties in establishing evidence to extrapolate results from one level of development to another, for example, from an in vitro demonstration phase to an in vivo demonstration phase. Additional guidance is required to cover the particularities of this type of product, as some challenges in the regulatory framework do not allow for an accurate assessment of NPs with sufficient evidence of clinical success. This work aims to identify current regulatory issues during the implementation of nanoparticle assays and describe the major challenges that researchers have faced when exposing a new formulation. We further reflect on the current regulatory standards required for the approval of these biopharmaceuticals and the requirements demanded by the regulatory agencies. Our work will provide helpful information to improve the success of nanomedicines by compiling the challenges described in the literature that support the development of this novel encapsulation system. We propose a step-by-step approach through the different stages of the development of nanoformulations, from their design to the clinical stage, exemplifying the different challenges and the measures taken by the regulatory agencies to respond to these challenges.

TI Heteroplasmic and homoplasmic m.616T > C in mitochondria tRNA(Phe)
   promote isolated chronic kidney disease and hyperuricemia
SO JCI INSIGHT
AB Inherited kidney diseases are the fifth most common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a vital role in the progression of inherited kidney diseases, while mitochondrial-transfer RNA (mt-tRNA) variants and their pathogenic contributions to kidney disease remain largely unclear. In this study, we identified the pathogenic mt-tRNA(Phe) 616T>C mutation in 3 families and documented that m.616T>C showed a high pathogenic threshold, with both heteroplasmy and homoplasmy leading to isolated chronic kidney disease and hyperuricemia without hematuria, proteinuria, or renal cyst formation. Moreover, 1 proband with homoplamic m.616T>C presented ESRD as a child. No symptoms of nervous system evolvement were observed in these families. Lymphoblast cells bearing m.616T>C exhibited swollen mitochondria, underwent active mitophagy, and showed respiratory deficiency, leading to reduced mitochondrial ATP production, diminished membrane potential, and overproduction of mitochondrial ROS. Pathogenic m.616T>C abolished a highly conserved base pair (A31-U39) in the anticodon stem-loop which altered the structure of mt-tRNA(Phe), as confirmed by a decreased melting temperature and slower electrophoretic mobility of the mutant tRNA. Furthermore, the unstable structure of mt-tRNA(Phe) contributed to a shortage of steady-state mt-tRNA(Phe) and enhanced aminoacylation efficiency, which resulted in impaired mitochondrial RNA translation and a significant decrease in mtDNA-encoded polypeptides. Collectively, these findings provide potentially new insights into the pathogenesis underlying inherited kidney disease caused by mitochondrial variants.

TI Transcriptomic Signatures Associated With Regional Cortical Thickness
   Changes in Parkinson's Disease
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE
AB Cortical atrophy is a common manifestation in Parkinson's disease (PD), particularly in advanced stages of the disease. To elucidate the molecular underpinnings of cortical thickness changes in PD, we performed an integrated analysis of brain-wide healthy transcriptomic data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas and patterns of cortical thickness based on T1-weighted anatomical MRI data of 149 PD patients and 369 controls. For this purpose, we used partial least squares regression to identify gene expression patterns correlated with cortical thickness changes. In addition, we identified gene expression patterns underlying the relationship between cortical thickness and clinical domains of PD. Our results show that genes whose expression in the healthy brain is associated with cortical thickness changes in PD are enriched in biological pathways related to sumoylation, regulation of mitotic cell cycle, mitochondrial translation, DNA damage responses, and ER-Golgi traffic. The associated pathways were highly related to each other and all belong to cellular maintenance mechanisms. The expression of genes within most pathways was negatively correlated with cortical thickness changes, showing higher expression in regions associated with decreased cortical thickness (atrophy). On the other hand, sumoylation pathways were positively correlated with cortical thickness changes, showing higher expression in regions with increased cortical thickness (hypertrophy). Our findings suggest that alterations in the balanced interplay of these mechanisms play a role in changes of cortical thickness in PD and possibly influence motor and cognitive functions.

TI High SEC61G expression predicts poor prognosis in patients with Head and
   Neck Squamous Cell Carcinomas
SO JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB Background: Overexpression of the membrane protein SEC61 translocon gamma subunit (SEC61G) has been observed in a variety of cancers; however, its role in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) is unknown. This study aimed to elucidate the relationship between SEC61G and HNSCC based on data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database.
   Methods: Data for HNSCC patients were collected from TCGA and the expression level of SEC61G was compared between paired HNSCC and normal tissues using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The relationship between clinicopathologic features and SEC61G expression was also analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and logistic regression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to evaluate the value of SEC61G as a binary classifier using the area under the curve (AUC value). The association of clinicopathologic characteristics with prognosis in HNSCC patients was assessed using Cox regression and the Kaplan-Meier methods. A nomogram, based on Cox multivariate analysis, was used to predict the impact of SEC61G on prognosis. Functional enrichment analysis was performed to determine the hallmark pathways associated with differentially expressed genes in HNSCC patients exhibiting high and low SEC61G expression.
   Results: The expression of SEC61G was significantly elevated in HNSCC tissues compared to normal tissues (P < 0.001). The high expression of SEC61G was significantly correlated with the T stage, M stage, clinical stage, TP53 mutation status, PIK3CA mutation status, primary therapy outcome, and cervical lymph node dissection (all P < 0.05). Meanwhile, ROC curves suggested the significant diagnostic ability of SEC61G for HNSCC (AUC = 0.923). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients with HNSCC characterized by high SEC61G expression had a poorer prognosis than patients with low SEC61G expression (hazard ratio = 1.95, 95% confidence interval 1.48-2.56, P < 0.001). Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that SEC61G was independently associated with overall survival (P = 0.027). Functional annotations indicated that SEC61G is involved in pathways related to translation and regulation of SLITs/ROBOs expression, SRP-dependent co-translational protein targeting to the membrane, nonsense-mediated decay, oxidative phosphorylation, and Parkinson's disease.
   Conclusion: SEC61G plays a vital role in HNSCC progression and prognosis; it may, therefore, serve as an effective biomarker for the prediction of patient survival.

TI miRNA-Dependent CD4(+) T Cell Differentiation in the Pathogenesis of
   Multiple Sclerosis
SO MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS INTERNATIONAL
AB Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by multifocal lesions, chronic inflammatory condition, and degenerative processes within the central nervous system (CNS) leading to demyelination. The most important cells involved in its pathogenesis are those which are CD4(+), particularly proinflammatory Th1/Th17 and regulatory Treg. Signal cascades associated with CD4(+) differentiation are regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs): short, single-stranded RNAs, responsible for negative regulation of gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. Several miRNAs have been consistently reported as showing dysregulated expression in MS, and their expression patterns may be elevated or decreased, depending on the function of specific miRNA in the immune system. Studies in MS patients indicate that, among others, miR-141, miR-200a, miR-155, miR-223, and miR-326 are upregulated, while miR-15b, miR-20b, miR-26a, and miR-30a are downregulated. Dysregulation of these miRNAs may contribute to the imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory processes, since their targets are associated with the regulation of Th1/Th17 and Treg cell differentiation. Highly expressed miRNAs can in turn suppress translation of key Th1/Th17 differentiation inhibitors. miRNA dysregulation may result from the impact of various factors at each stage of their biogenesis. Immature miRNA undergoes multistage transcriptional and posttranscriptional modifications; therefore, any protein involved in the processing of miRNAs can potentially lead to disturbances in their expression. Epigenetic modifications that have a direct impact on miRNA gene transcription may also play an important role.

TI Burma Terrane Collision and Northward Indentation in the Eastern
   Himalayas Recorded in the Eocene-Miocene Chindwin Basin (Myanmar)
SO TECTONICS
AB The Burma Terrane (Myanmar) played an important role in the India-Asia collision and moved over 2,000 km northward on the Indian Plate during the Cenozoic, before colliding with the Asian margin. However, the timing of this collision and its correlation to regional uplift phases, sedimentary provenance, and basin development remain poorly constrained. We report sedimentological, paleomagnetic, and geochronological data from the late Eocene to early Miocene strata of the Chindwin Basin in the Burmese forearc, constraining the paleogeographic evolution of the Burma Terrane and the Eastern Himalayan orogen. Our results highlight two unconformities of late Eocene-middle Oligocene and latest Oligocene-early Miocene age, revealing a two-stage interaction of the Burma Terrane with the Asian margin during its northward translation. The first unconformity follows rapid similar to 0.6 m/ky subsidence in the Burmese forearc, as shown by magnetostratigraphy. The transition to a fluvial depositional environment and the occurrence of reworked sediments at this first unconformity likely records the commencing collision of India and the northern extent of the Burma Terrane with the Asian margin. The second unconformity shows drastic changes in magnetic properties, mineralogy, and provenance, with high-grade metamorphic grains and early Miocene apatite U-Pb and fission-track ages indicating that it is coeval to a major deformation phase in Myanmar and the Eastern Himalayan orogen. It likely records the indentation of the Burma Terrane into the Eastern Himalayan collision zone, forming the modern Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis.

TI Stem Cell Research in Pakistan; Past, Present and Future
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM CELLS
AB Background and Objectives: Stem cells have proved to have great therapeutic potential as stem cell treatment is replacing traditional ways of treatment in different disorders like cancer, aplastic anemia, stroke, heart disorders. The developed and developing countries are investing differently in this area of research so research output and clinical translation of research greatly vary among developed and developing countries. Present study was done to investigate the current status of stem cells research in Pakistan and ways to improve it.
   Results: Many advanced countries (USA, UK and Canada etc.) are investing heavily in stem cell research and treatment. Different developing countries like Iran, Turkey and India are also following the developed countries and investing a lot in stem cells research. Pakistan is also making efforts in establishing this field to get desired benefits but unfortunately the progress is at very low pace. If Government plays an active role along with private sector, stem cell research in Pakistan can be boosted up. The numbers of publications from Pakistan are very less compared to developed and neighboring countries and Pakistan also has very less number of institutes working in this area of research.
   Conclusions: Stem cells research is at its initial stages in Pakistan and there is great need to bring Government, academia and industry together so they could make serious efforts to promote research in this very important field. This will help millions of patients suffering from incurable disorders and will also reduce economic loss.

TI Global estimation of the 3 ' untranslated region landscape using RNA
   sequencing
SO METHODS
AB The 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of mRNA contains elements that play regulatory roles in polyadenylation, localization, translation efficiency, and mRNA stability. Despite the significance of the 3' UTR, there is no popular method for annotating 3' UTRs and for profiling their isoforms. Recently, poly(A)-position profiling by sequencing (3P-seq) and other similar methods have successfully been used to annotate 3' UTRs; however, they contain complex RNA-biochemical experimental steps, resulting in a low yield of products. In this paper, we propose heuristic and regression methods to estimate and quantify the usage of 3' UTRs with widely profiled RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. With this approach, the 3' UTR usage estimated from RNA-seq was found to be highly correlated to that of 3P-seq, and poly(A) cleavage signals of 3' UTRs were detected upstream of the predicted poly(A) cleavage sites. Our methods predicted greater number of 3' UTRs than 3P-seq, which allows the profiling of the 3' UTRs of most expressed genes in diverse cell-types, stages, and species. Hence, the computational RNA-seq method for the estimation of the 3' UTR landscape would be useful as a tool for studying not only the functional roles of 3' UTR but also gene regulation by 3' UTR in a cell type-specific context. The method is implemented in open-source code, which is available at http://big.hanyang.ac.kr/GETUTR. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Targeting the Lnc-OPHN1-5/androgen receptor/hnRNPA1 complex increases
   Enzalutamide sensitivity to better suppress prostate cancer progression
SO CELL DEATH & DISEASE
AB Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been found to play critical roles in regulating gene expression, but their function in translational control is poorly understood. We found lnc-OPHN1-5, which lies close to the androgen receptor (AR) gene on chromosome X, increased prostate cancer (PCa) Enzalutamide (Enz) sensitivity via decreasing AR protein expression and associated activity. Mechanism dissection revealed that lnc-OPHN1-5 interacted with AR-mRNA to minimize its interaction with the RNA binding protein (RBP) hnRNPA1. Suppressing lnc-OPHN1-5 expression promoted the interaction between AR-mRNA and hnRNPA1, followed by an increase of ribosome association with AR-mRNA and translation. This effect was reversed by increasing lnc-OPHN1-5 expression. Consistently, the in vivo mice model confirmed that knocking down lnc-OPHN1-5 expression in tumors significantly increased the tumor formation rate and AR protein expression compared with the control group. Furthermore, knocking down hnRNPA1 blocked/reversed shlnc-OPHN1-5-increased AR protein expression and re-sensitized cells to Enz treatment efficacy. Evidence from Enz-resistant cell lines, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, clinical samples, and a human PCa study accordantly suggested that patients with low expression of lnc-OPHN1-5 likely have unfavorable prognoses and probably are less sensitive to Enz treatment. In summary, targeting this newly identified lnc-OPHN1-5/AR/hnRNPA1 complex may help develop novel therapies to increase Enz treatment sensitivity for suppressing the PCa at an advanced stage.

TI Time2bHealthy - An online childhood obesity prevention program for
   preschool-aged children: A randomised controlled trial protocol
SO CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS
AB Background: The use of parent-focused internet-based programs for the prevention and treatment of childhood obesity has shown promise but there is an acknowledged gap in parent-focused interventions which target the early childhood stage.
   Methods: The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of Time2bHealthy- an online healthy lifestyle program for parents of preschool-aged children. The program will be evaluated using a two-arm, parallel, randomised controlled design. The 11-week program is underpinned by Social Cognitive Theory and consists of interactive modules on healthy eating, physical activity, screen-time and sleep. The intervention also involves elements of social media, where participants share discuss ideas and experiences and they can interact and obtain information with experts. Time2bHealthy is being compared to a comparison condition. Outcomes include change in BMI (primary outcome), dietary intake, physical activity, sleep, child feeding, parental role-modelling and parent self-efficacy. Process evaluation data, such as adherence and engagement with the online forums, will also be collected.
   Discussion: Time2bHealthy is the first randomised controlled trial to our knowledge to assess the efficacy of an online parent-focussed healthy lifestyle program for preschool-aged children in changing body mass index. Early childhood is a crucial time for establishing healthy lifestyle behaviours and parents play an important role. This study therefore fills an important gap in the literature. If found to be efficacious, Time2bHealthy has potential for broad-reach access and translation into primary health care services.

TI A bioinformatics analysis for diagnostic roles of the E2F family in
   esophageal cancer
SO JOURNAL OF GASTROINTESTINAL ONCOLOGY
AB Background: Esophageal cancer (EC) is the eighth most commonly occurring cancer worldwide and the sixth leading cause of cancer-related deaths. The therapeutic effect of EC patients is not ideal, and new biomarkers are needed to guide diagnosis and prognosis of EC patients. E2F family transcription factors are among the most important links in the cell cycle regulatory network. E2Fs dysregulation not only promotes the early stages of tumor development but also the progression of benign tumors to malignant tumors. E2F is expected to be a new biomarker. The prognostic significance of the E2F family in EC requires further research.Methods: We analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), and GeneMANIA databases to obtain RNA-sequencing data and clinical data. The clinical data included age, gender, race, stage, type, status, etc. The prognosis outcome included overall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI). Subsequently, we conducted further research on gene expressions, enrichment analysis, interaction network, and prognostic values by R software, containing ggplot2, ComplexHeatmap, DESeq2, pROC R package, based on t-test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, Spearman rank correlation analysis, log-rank test and COX model.Results: We found that mRNA transcription levels of E2F1, E2F3-8 were more highly expressed in esophageal carcinoma (ESCA) tissues than in normal tissues. E2F8 expression was correlated with tumor stage [Pr(>F)=0.00856]. E2F-related genes played a role in development and differentiation, and were prevalent in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, Golgi lumen, and lipoprotein particle, catalyzing translation activities and lipid metabolism. Each gene was found to be related to each other to some degree. The GeneMANIA network analysis revealed links between E2Fs and other genes. We compared the correlations between 24 kinds of tumor-infiltrating immune cells and E2Fs. E2F1 (AUC =0.945, CI: 0.890-1.000) and E2F7 (AUC =0.958, CI: 0.920-0.996) exhibited higher predictive power accuracy. However, only E2F7 was closely related to OS [HR =1.91 (1.16-3.16), P=0.011].Conclusions: We discover that E2F7 is a prognostic biomarker. E2F family may take part in the development of EC through lipid metabolism pathways, which is helpful to predict the prognosis of EC patients and guide accurate diagnosis and treatment.

TI Transcriptomic, proteomic, and phosphoproteomic analyses reveal dynamic
   signaling networks influencing long-grain rice development
SO CROP JOURNAL
AB The LGS1 (Large grain size 1) gene, also known as GS2/GL2/OsGRF4, is involved in regulating grain size and quality in rice, but the mechanism governing grain size has not been elucidated. We performed transcrip-tomic, proteomic, and phosphoproteomic analyses of young rice panicles in Samba (a wild-type cultivar with extra-small grain) and NIL-LGS1 (a nearly isogenic line of LGS1 with large grain in the Samba genetic background) at three developmental stages (4-6) to identify internal dynamic functional networks deter-mining grain size that are mediated by LGS1. Differentially expressed proteins formed seven highly func-tionally correlated clusters. The concordant regulation of multiple functional clusters may be key features of the development of grain length in rice. In stage 5, 16 and 24 phosphorylated proteins were signifi-cantly up-regulated and down-regulated, and dynamic phosphorylation events may play accessory roles in determining rice grain size by participating in protein-protein interaction networks. Transcriptomic analysis in stage 5 showed that differentially expressed alternative splicing events and dynamic gene reg-ulatory networks based on 39 transcription factors and their highly correlated target genes might con-tribute to rice grain development. Integrative multilevel omics analysis suggested that the regulatory network at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels could be directly manifested at the transla-tional level, and this analysis also suggested a regulatory mechanism, regulation of protein translation levels, in the biological process that extends from transcript to protein to the development of grain. Functional analysis suggested that biological processes including MAPK signaling, calcium signaling, cell proliferation, cell wall, energy metabolism, hormone pathway, and ubiquitin-proteasome pathway might be involved in LGS1-mediated regulation of grain length. Thus, LGS1-mediated regulation of grain size is affected by dynamic transcriptional, posttranscriptional, translational and posttranslational changes.

TI Proteasome Modulates Positive and Negative Translational Regulators in
   Long-Term Synaptic Plasticity
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE
AB Proteolysis by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway appears to have a complex role in synaptic plasticity, but its various functions remain to be elucidated. Using late phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP) in the hippocampus of the mouse as a model for long-term synaptic plasticity, we previously showed that inhibition of the proteasome enhances induction but blocks maintenance of L-LTP. In this study, we investigated the possible mechanisms by which proteasome inhibition has opposite effects on L-LTP induction and maintenance. Our results show that inhibiting phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase or blocking the interaction between eukaryotic initiation factors 4E (eIF4E) and 4G (eIF4G) reduces the enhancement of L-LTP induction brought about by proteasome inhibition suggesting interplay between proteolysis and the signaling pathway mediated by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Also, proteasome inhibition leads to accumulation of translational activators in the mTOR pathway such as eIF4E and eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) early during L-LTP causing increased induction. Furthermore, inhibition of the proteasome causes a buildup of translational repressors, such as polyadenylate-binding protein interacting protein 2 (Paip2) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 2 (4E-BP2), during late stages of L-LTP contributing to the blockade of L-LTP maintenance. Thus, the proteasome plays a critical role in regulating protein synthesis during L-LTP by tightly controlling translation. Our results provide novel mechanistic insights into the interplay between protein degradation and protein synthesis in long-term synaptic plasticity.

TI Multiple crosstalks between mRNA biogenesis and SUMO
SO CHROMOSOMA
AB mRNA metabolism involves the orchestration of multiple nuclear events, including transcription, processing (e.g., capping, splicing, polyadenylation), and quality control. This leads to the accurate formation of messenger ribonucleoparticles (mRNPs) that are finally exported to the cytoplasm for translation. The production of defined sets of mRNAs in given environmental or physiological situations relies on multiple regulatory mechanisms that target the mRNA biogenesis machineries. Among other regulations, post-translational modification by the small ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO, whose prominence in several cellular processes has been largely demonstrated, also plays a key role in mRNA biogenesis. Analysis of the multiple available SUMO proteomes and functional validations of an increasing number of sumoylated targets have revealed the key contribution of SUMO-dependent regulation in nuclear mRNA metabolism. While sumoylation of transcriptional activators and repressors is so far best documented, SUMO contribution to other stages of mRNA biogenesis is also emerging. Modification of mRNA metabolism factors by SUMO determine their subnuclear targeting and biological activity, notably by regulating their molecular interactions with nucleic acids or protein partners. In particular, sumoylation of DNA-bound transcriptional regulators interfere with their association to target sequences or chromatin modifiers. In addition, the recent identification of enzymes of the SUMO pathway within specialized mRNA biogenesis machineries may provide a further level of regulation to their specificity. These multiple crosstalks between mRNA metabolism and SUMO appear therefore as important players in cellular regulatory networks.

TI Targeted knock-in mice with a human mutation in GRTH/DDX25 reveals the
   essential role of phosphorylated GRTH in spermatid development during
   spermatogenesis
SO HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS
AB Gonadotropin-regulated testicular RNA helicase (GRTH/DDX25) is a testis specific member of the DEAD-box family of RNA helicases expressed in meiotic and haploid germ cells which plays an essential role in spermatogenesis. There are two species of GRTH the 56 kDa non-phospho and 61 kDa phospho forms. Our early studies revealed a missense mutation ((RH)-H-242) of GRTH in azoospermic men that when expressed in COS1-cells lack the phospho-form of GRTH. To investigate the role of the phospho-GRTH species in spermatogenesis, we generated a GRTH knock-in (KI) transgenic mice with the R242H mutation. GRTH-KI mice are sterile with reduced testis size, lack sperm with spermatogenic arrest at round spermatid stage and loss of the cytoplasmic phospho-GRTH species. Electron microscopy studies revealed reduction in the size of chromatoid bodies (CB) of round spermatids (RS) and germ cell apoptosis. We observed absence of phospho-GRTH in the CB of RS. Complete loss of chromatin remodeling and related proteins such as TP2, PRM2, TSSK6 and marked reduction of their respective mRNAs and half-lives were observed in GRTH-KI mice. We showed that phospho-GRTH has a role in TP2 translation and revealed its occurrence in a 3' UTR dependent manner. These findings demonstrate the relevance of phospho-GRTH in the structure of the chromatoid body, spermatid development and completion of spermatogenesis and provide an avenue for the development of a male contraceptive.

TI Influence on the electrolyte resistance of the contact angle of a bubble
   attached to a disk electrode
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB In a previous work, the analysis of the electrolyte-resistance (ER) increment due to the presence of an insulating sphere above or in contact with a disk electrode, simulating a spherical particle, drop, or gas bubble close or attached to an electrode has been reported (Bouazaze et al., 2010) [17]. In the present work, the influence on the ER of the contact angle with the electrode surface, which plays for example a major role in the size of bubbles on gas-evolving electrodes, is quantitatively determined. The mathematical collocation method used in the previous work was improved to account for the change in geometry of the electrode-sphere system. The theoretical results show that the ER increment due to the presence of the sphere depends on its size, position, and contact angle. For a given size and position of spheres of aspect ratio less than 0.4, the ER increment due to the contact angle varies roughly between -45% and +35% of the increment due to a perfect sphere, depending on the interplay of the surface and volume competing effects influencing the ER. Despite their low values, the ER increments could be experimentally measured for spheres of different contact angle placed at the electrode centre, owing to a high-precision motorized translation stage and a specific low-noise ER measurement device. An excellent agreement was obtained between the theoretical and experimental results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The epidermal growth factor network: role in oocyte growth, maturation
   and developmental competence
SO HUMAN REPRODUCTION UPDATE
AB BACKGROUND: The LH surge induces great physiological changes within the preovulatory follicle, which culminate in the ovulation of a mature oocyte that is capable of supporting embryo and foetal development. However, unlike mural granulosa cells, the oocyte and its surrounding cumulus cells are not directly responsive to LH, indicating that the LH signal is mediated by secondary factors produced by the granulosa cells. The mechanisms by which the oocyte senses the ovulatory LH signal and hence prepares for ovulation has been a subject of considerable controversy for the past four decades. Within the last 15 years several significant insights have been made into the molecular mechanisms orchestrating oocyte development, maturation and ovulation. These findings centre on the epidermal growth factor (EGF) pathway and the role it plays in the complex signalling network that finely regulates oocyte maturation and ovulation.
   OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: This review outlines the role of the EGF network during oocyte development and regulation of the ovulatory cascade, and in particular focuses on the effect of the EGF network on oocyte developmental competence. Application of this new knowledge to advances in ART is examined.
   SEARCH METHODS: The PubMed database was used to search for peer-reviewed original and review articles concerning the EGF network. Publications offering a comprehensive description of the role of the EGF network in follicle and oocyte development were used.
   OUTCOMES: It is now clear that acute upregulation of the EGF network is an essential component of the ovulatory cascade as it transmits the LH signal from the periphery of the follicle to the cumulus-oocyte complex (COC). More recent findings have elucidated new roles for the EGF network in the regulation of oocyte development. EGF signalling downregulates the somatic signal 3'5'-cyclic guanine monophosphate that suppresses oocyte meiotic maturation and simultaneously provides meiotic inducing signals. The EGF network also controls translation of maternal transcripts in the quiescent oocyte, a process that is integral to oocyte competence. As a means of restricting the ovulatory signal to the Graffian follicle, most COCs in the ovary are unresponsive to EGF-ligands. Recent studies have revealed that development of a functional EGF signalling network in cumulus cells requires dual endocrine (FSH) and oocyte paracrine cues (growth differentiation factor 9 and bone morphogenetic protein 15), and this occurs progressively in COCs during the last stages of folliculogenesis. Hence, a new concept to emerge is that cumulus cell acquisition of EGF receptor responsiveness represents a developmental hallmark in folliculogenesis, analogous to FSH-induction of LH receptor signalling in mural granulosa cells. Likewise, this event represents a major milestone in the oocyte's developmental progression and acquisition of developmental competence. It is now clear that EGF signalling is perturbed in COCs matured in vitro. This has inspired novel concepts in IVM systems to ameliorate this perturbation, resulting in improved oocyte developmental competence.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS: An oocyte of high quality is imperative for fertility. Elucidating the fundamental molecular and cellular mechanims by which the EGF network regulates oocyte maturation and ovulation can be expected to open new opportunities in ART. This knowledge has already led to advances in oocyte IVM in animal models. Translation of such advances into a clinical setting should increase the efficacy of IVM, making it a viable treatment option for a wide range of patients, thereby simplifying fertility treatment and bringing substantial cost and health benefits.

TI Faust made in China: Meng Jinghui and Shen Lin's irreverent
   socio-cultural deconstruction of Goethe's iconic masterpiece
SO NEOHELICON
AB China's unparalleled economic rise in the past 30 years and the blistering social transformation associated with it has generated immense interest globally in China as a nation. Regrettably, Western interest is still extremely narrow and restricted to statistical economic data and the belief that social change in China and modernisation is driven exclusively by the forces of globalisation, that is, economic forces, is widespread and little attention is given outside of specialist circles to the new robust intellectual and artistic-creative energies underlying China's transformation and self-invention since 1978, identified by Deng Xiaoping as absolutely essential for China's modernisation program. Bootleg Faust (Daoban Fushide, written by Shen Lin of the Central Academy of Drama, 1999), the ambitious staging of the translation-adaptation-deconstruction of the German classic by Meng Jinghui, China's leading experimental theatre director on January 1, 2000 to welcome the New Millennium (and to celebrate the 250th anniversary of Goethe's birth) is a remarkable artistic achievement. The very fact that Goethe's Faust One and Two, completed in 1832, and rarely performed in its totality in German-speaking countries, can be staged in Chinese adaptation for weeks, and to full houses in Beijing, Shanghai and other Chinese provincial centres and overseas is proof that the Luhanite vision of a global village is no longer virtual, but real, just as real as Meng Jinghui and Shen Lin's theatrical professionalism and genius to give Goethe's signature work relevance in twenty-first century China. Some of the salient aspects of this theatrical achievement and the sociocultural significance of Meng and Shen's irreverent artistic endeavour of deconstructing Goethe's Faust will be explored in this paper.

TI Enhancing full-length antibody production by signal peptide engineering
SO MICROBIAL CELL FACTORIES
AB Background: Protein secretion to the periplasm of Escherichia coli offers an attractive route for producing heterologous proteins including antibodies. In this approach, a signal peptide is fused to the N-terminus of the heterologous protein. The signal peptide mediates translocation of the heterologous protein from the cytoplasm to the periplasm and is cleaved during the translocation process. It was previously shown that optimization of the translation initiation region (TIR) which overlaps with the nucleotide sequence of the signal sequence improves the production of heterologous proteins. Despite the progress, there is still room to improve yields using secretion as a means to produce protein complexes such as full-length monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).
   Results: In this study we identified the inefficient secretion of heavy chain as the limitation for full-length mAb accumulation in the periplasm. To improve heavy chain secretion we investigated the effects of various signal peptides at controlled TIR strengths. The signal peptide of disulfide oxidoreductase (DsbA) mediated more efficient secretion of heavy chain than the other signal peptides tested. Mutagenesis studies demonstrated that at controlled translational levels, hydrophobicity of the hydrophobic core (H-region) of the signal peptide is a critical factor for heavy chain secretion and full-length mAb accumulation in the periplasm. Increasing the hydrophobicity of a signal peptide enhanced heavy chain secretion and periplasmic levels of assembled full-length mAbs, while decreasing the hydrophobicity had the opposite effect.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that under similar translational strengths, the hydrophobicity of the signal peptide plays an important role in heavy chain secretion. Increasing the hydrophobicity of the H-region and controlling TIR strengths can serve as an approach to improve heavy chain secretion and full-length mAb production in E. coli.

AB Despite advances in diagnostic and therapeutic technology of human diseases, cancer remains among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The development of molecular imaging has made it possible to diagnose and treat cancer at early stages, which increases the likelihood of survival. Nuclear medicine has played a key role in diagnosis and staging of human malignancy. However, most imaging technology can only be used in the preoperative diagnosis stage, and these methods are time consuming and often expose patients to a high amount of radiation. Combined with appropriate contrast agents, fluorescence molecular imaging is an easy-to-use imaging tool that can be implemented for intraoperative cancer surgery to delineate tumor margins. In particular, near-infrared fluorescence is useful for image-guided cancer surgery because of the relatively high tissue penetration, low tissue absorption and scattering, and reduced autofluorescence. In this review, the basic principles of fluorescence molecular imaging technology are introduced and classified by characteristics, and their applications to biomedical imaging and image-guided surgery are discussed.

TI Clinicopathologic Implications of Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 3f and
   Her-2/neu Expression in Gastric Cancer
SO CTS-CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE
AB Background:To detect the expression of eIF3f and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her-2)/neu in gastric cancer (GC), correlation with their clinicopathological parameters and the relationship of eIF3f and Her-2/neu in the occurrence and development of GC.
   Methods:A total of 195 gastrectomy specimens with stage I to III were examined for eIF3f expression by immunohistochemistry and for Her-2/neu expression by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with the median follow-up period of 38 months.
   Results:The positive expression rate of eIF3f in GC and adjacent noncancerous tissue were 33.8% and 59.5%, respectively. eIF3f levels were linked to more advanced tumor stages and likelihood of recurrence (all p < 0.05). The Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated that decreased expression of eIF3f could serve as a prognosis marker for poor outcome of GC patients (p = 0.04). 15.9% of GC specimens were positive for Her-2/neu, but whose expression was of no correlation with patients' survival. Patients who were positive for Her-2/neu also had high eIF3f expression levels (p = 0.0295).
   Conclusion:Results suggest that eIF3f may play an important role in recurrence, thus representing a promising predictive marker for the prognosis of GC. But Her-2/neu has no relationship with the prognosis of GC. The clinical significance of eIF3f and Her-2/neu remains to be further investigated.

TI Comparative transcriptome analysis of cotton fiber development of Upland
   cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) and Chromosome Segment Substitution Lines
   from G. hirsutum x G. barbadense
SO BMC GENOMICS
AB Background: How to develop new cotton varieties possessing high yield traits of Upland cotton and superior fiber quality traits of Sea Island cotton remains a key task for cotton breeders and researchers. While multiple attempts bring in little significant progresses, the development of Chromosome Segment Substitution Lines (CSSLs) from Gossypium barbadense in G. hirsutum background provided ideal materials for aforementioned breeding purposes in upland cotton improvement. Based on the excellent fiber performance and relatively clear chromosome substitution segments information identified by Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) markers, two CSSLs, MBI9915 and MBI9749, together with the recurrent parent CCRI36 were chosen to conduct transcriptome sequencing during the development stages of fiber elongation and Secondary Cell Wall (SCW) synthesis (from 10DPA and 28DPA), aiming at revealing the mechanism of fiber development and the potential contribution of chromosome substitution segments from Sea Island cotton to fiber development of Upland cotton.
   Results: In total, 15 RNA-seq libraries were constructed and sequenced separately, generating 705.433 million clean reads with mean GC content of 45.13% and average Q30 of 90.26%. Through multiple comparisons between libraries, 1801 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, of which the 902 up-regulated DEGs were mainly involved in cell wall organization and response to oxidative stress and auxin, while the 898 down-regulated ones participated in translation, regulation of transcription, DNA-templated and cytoplasmic translation based on GO annotation and KEGG enrichment analysis. Subsequently, STEM software was performed to explicate the temporal expression pattern of DEGs. Two peroxidases and four flavonoid pathway-related genes were identified in the "oxidation-reduction process", which could play a role in fiber development and quality formation. Finally, the reliability of RNA-seq data was validated by quantitative real-time PCR of randomly selected 20 genes.
   Conclusions: The present report focuses on the similarities and differences of transcriptome profiles between the two CSSLs and the recurrent parent CCRI36 and provides novel insights into the molecular mechanism of fiber development, and into further exploration of the feasible contribution of G. barbadense substitution segments to fiber quality formation, which will lay solid foundation for simultaneously improving fiber yield and quality of upland cotton through CSSLs.

TI Hamlet, or about Death: A Romanian Hamlet directed by Vlad Mugur (2001)
SO MULTICULTURAL SHAKESPEARE-TRANSLATION APPROPRIATION AND PERFORMANCE
AB This essay looks at the 2001 Romanian production of Hamlet directed by Vlad Mugur at the Cluj National Theatre (Romania) from the perspective of geocriticism and spatial literary studies, analysing the stage space opened in front of the audiences. While the bare stage suggests asceticism and alienation, the production distances the twenty-first century audiences from what might have seemed difficult to understand from their postmodern perspectives. The production abbreviates the topic to its bare essence, just as a map condenses space, in the form of "literary cartography" (Tally 20). There is no room in this production for baroque ornaments and theatrical flourishing; instead, the production explores the exposed depth of human existence. The production is an exploration of theatre and art, of what dramatists and directors can do with artful language, of the theatre as an exploration of human experience and potential. It is about the human condition and the artist's place in the world, about old and new, about life and death, while everything happens on the edge of nothingness. The director's own death before the opening night of the production ties Shakespeare's Hamlet with existential issues in an even deeper way than the play itself allows us to expose.

SO NEIZVESTNYI DOSTOEVSKII-THE UNKNOWN DOSTOEVSKY
AB The article introduces into scientific circulation two letters written by the widow and daughter of F. M. Dostoevsky in 1912 and 1924 and addressed to the famous French director Jacques Copeau. These documents were discovered as a result of archival searches in the J. Copeau foundation in the National Library of France. The two letters are connected by their subject - the debut production of the play "The Brothers Karamazov" by Copeau at the Paris Theater of Arts in 1911. Reviews of the production published in the European and Russian press contain range of opinions: from enthusiastic to sharply critical. In his letter A. G. Dostoevskaya praised Copeau's drama, however, she familiarized herself with it without seeing the theatrical production itself, by reading the book that the director had sent her. The publication of Copeau's play, which is based on the novel "The Brothers Karamazov," is a little-known exhibit of the Memorial Museum of F. M. Dostoevsky, established by the writer's widow in 1889. It is mentioned only in the notebook of A. G. Dostoevskaya 1912-1913. The year of inclusion of published Copeau's play in the collection of the Memorial Museum of F. M. Dostoevsky is established based on the letter and the notebook of the writer's widow. The letter from L. F. Dostoevsky contains information about her communication with such famous French writers as Jacques Copeau, Irenee Mauget and Paul Bourgeois, as well as about the attempts of the copyright heiress to receive remuneration for the production undertaken by Copeau. These details augment the currently scarce information about the emigration period in the biography of the writer's daughter. The appendix to the article contains the letters of A. G. and L. F. Dostoevsky in French and in translation.

TI SLE: Novel Postulates for Therapeutic Options
SO FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
AB Genetic deficiency in C1q is a strong susceptibility factor for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). There are two major hypotheses that potentially explain the role of C1q in SLE. The first postulates that C1q deficiency abrogates apoptotic cell clearance, leading to persistently high loads of potentially immunogenic self-antigens that trigger autoimmune responses. While C1q undoubtedly plays an important role in apoptotic clearance, an essential biological process such as removal of self- waste is so critical for host survival that multiple ligand-receptor combinations do fortunately exist to ensure that proper disposal of apoptotic debris is accomplished even in the absence of C1q. The second hypothesis is based on the observation that locally synthesized C1q plays a critical role in regulating the earliest stages of monocyte to dendritic cell (DC) differentiation and function. Indeed, circulating C1q has been shown to keep monocytes in a pre-dendritic state by silencing key molecular players and ensuring that unwarranted DC-driven immune responses do not occur. Monocytes are also able to display macromolecular C1 on their surface, representing a novel mechanism for the recognition of circulating "danger." Translation of this danger signal in turn, provides the requisite "license" to trigger a differentiation pathway that leads to adaptive immune response. Based on this evidence, the second hypothesis proposes that deficiency in C1q dysregulates monocyte-to-DC differentiation and causes inefficient or defective maintenance of self-tolerance. The fact that C1q receptors (cC1qR and gC1qR) are also expressed on the surface of both monocytes and DCs, suggests that C1q/C1qR may regulate DC differentiation and function through specific cell-signaling pathways. While their primary ligand is C1q, C1qRs can also independently recognize a vast array of plasma proteins as well as pathogen-associated molecular ligands, indicating that these molecules may collaborate in antigen recognition and processing, and thus regulate DC-differentiation. This review will therefore focus on the role of C1q and C1qRs in SLE and explore the gC1qR/C1q axis as a potential target for therapy.

TI Comparative proteomics analysis of developing peanut aerial and
   subterranean pods identifies pod swelling related proteins
SO JOURNAL OF PROTEOMICS
AB The peanut plant produces flowers aerially, while develops the fruits and seeds underground. Pod swelling is a vital process of peanut pod and seed development only occurring after the gynophore carrying the ovule into the soil. The failure of gynophore penetration into the soil leads to suppression of pod swelling initiation. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the process remains unknown. A comparative proteome analysis between developing aerial and subterranean pods at various developmental stages was performed using 2-DE approach. 47 significantly differentially expressed spots were selected to further identification by MALDI-TOF-TOF MS. They were corresponded to 31 distinct proteins, suggesting that many identified spots were modified in post-translation. Functional annotation revealed their involvement in twelve important biological processes, such as photosynthesis, oxidative stress response, lignin synthesis, fatty acid biosynthesis, glycolysis, protein catabolic process, cellular metabolic process, regulation process, etc. Furthermore, 10 identified proteins were validated by real-time RT-PCR analysis. Several photosynthesis and oxidative stress proteins displayed elevated expression levels in aerial pods. Otherwise, enzymes in lignin synthesis and ubiquitin proteasome system were down-accumulation in subterranean pods. These enzymes might function as potential candidate proteins and play critical roles to regulate pods swelling and development
   Biological significance
   Pod swelling plays a crucial role in peanut fruit and seed development. However, a large number of aerial pods can't form normal pods due to suppression of swelling initiation by the failure of penetration into the soil, thereby causing to seed yield loss. Limited knowledge is available underlying molecular mechanism regulating initiation of swelling in peg tips and pod development. The results generated in this study may provide evidence for some functional proteins as potential candidates to pod swelling and new molecular insights to improve our understanding of pod development under light and darkness conditions, which may contribute valuable information to high yield breeding in future.

TI Research, evidence and policymaking: the perspectives of policy actors
   on improving uptake of evidence in health policy development and
   implementation in Uganda
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Background: Use of evidence in health policymaking plays an important role, especially in resource-constrained settings where informed decisions on resource allocation are paramount. Several knowledge translation (KT) models have been developed, but few have been applied to health policymaking in low income countries. If KT models are expected to explain evidence uptake and implementation, or lack of it, they must be contextualized and take into account the specificity of low income countries for example, the strong influence of donors. The main objective of this research is to elaborate a Middle Range Theory (MRT) of KT in Uganda that can also serve as a reference for other low- and middle income countries.
   Methods: This two-step study employed qualitative approaches to examine the principal barriers and facilitating factors to KT. Step 1 involved a literature review and identification of common themes. The results informed the development of the initial MRT, which details the facilitating factors and barriers to KT at the different stages of research and policy development. In Step 2, these were further refined through key informant interviews with policymakers and researchers in Uganda. Deductive content and thematic analysis was carried out to assess the degree of convergence with the elements of the initial MRT and to identify other emerging issues.
   Results: Review of the literature revealed that the most common emerging facilitating factors could be grouped under institutional strengthening for KT, research characteristics, dissemination, partnerships and political context. The analysis of interviews, however, showed that policymakers and researchers ranked institutional strengthening for KT, research characteristics and partnerships as the most important. New factors emphasized by respondents were the use of mainstreamed structures within MoH to coordinate and disseminate research, the separation of roles between researchers and policymakers, and the role of the community and civil society in KT.
   Conclusions: This study refined an initial MRT on KT in policymaking in the health sector in Uganda that was based on a literature review. It provides a framework that can be used in empirical research of the process of KT on specific policy issues.

TI Hepatic Connexin 32 Associates With Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease
   Severity
SO HEPATOLOGY COMMUNICATIONS
AB Emerging data highlight the critical role for the innate immune system in the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Connexin 32 (Cx32), the primary liver gap junction protein, is capable of modulating hepatic innate immune responses and has been studied in dietary animal models of steatohepatitis. In this work, we sought to determine the association of hepatic Cx32 with the stages of human NAFLD in a histologically characterized cohort of 362 patients with NAFLD. We also studied the hepatic expression of the genes and proteins known to interact with Cx32 (known as the connexome) in patients with NAFLD. Last, we used three independent dietary mouse models of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis to investigate the role of Cx32 in the development of steatohepatitis and fibrosis. In a univariate analysis, we found that Cx32 hepatic expression associates with each component of the NAFLD activity score and fibrosis severity. Multivariate analysis revealed that Cx32 expression most closely associated with the NAFLD activity score and fibrosis compared to known risk factors for the disease. Furthermore, by analyzing the connexome, we identified novel genes related to Cx32 that associate with NAFLD progression. Finally, we demonstrated that Cx32 deficiency protects against liver injury, inflammation, and fibrosis in three murine models of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis by limiting initial diet-induced hepatoxicity and subsequent increases in intestinal permeability. Conclusion: Hepatic expression of Cx32 strongly associates with steatohepatitis and fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. We also identify novel genes associated with NAFLD and suggest that Cx32 plays a role in promoting NAFLD development.

TI Elucidating the A beta 42 Anti-Aggregation Mechanism of Action of
   Tramiprosate in Alzheimer's Disease: Integrating Molecular Analytical
   Methods, Pharmacokinetic and Clinical Data
SO CNS DRUGS
AB Background Amyloid beta (A beta) oligomers play a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and represent a promising target for drug development. Tramiprosate is a small-molecule A beta anti-aggregation agent that was evaluated in phase III clinical trials for AD but did not meet the primary efficacy endpoints; however, a prespecified subgroup analysis revealed robust, sustained, and clinically meaningful cognitive and functional effects in patients with AD homozygous for the epsilon 4 allele of apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4/4 homozygotes), who carry an increased risk for the disease. Therefore, to build on this important efficacy attribute and to further improve its pharmaceutical properties, we have developed a prodrug of tramiprosate ALZ-801 that is in advanced stages of clinical development. To elucidate how tramiprosate works, we investigated its molecular mechanism of action (MOA) and the translation to observed clinical outcomes.
   Objective The two main objectives of this research were to (1) elucidate and characterize the MOA of tramiprosate via an integrated application of three independent molecular methodologies and (2) present an integrated translational analysis that links the MOA, conformation of the target, stoichiometry, and pharmacokinetic dose exposure to the observed clinical outcome in APOE4/4 homozygote subjects.
   Method We used three molecular analytical methods-ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (IMS-MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and molecular dynamics-to characterize the concentration-related interactions of tramiprosate versus A beta 42 monomers and the resultant conformational alterations affecting aggregation into oligomers. The molecular stoichiometry of the tramiprosate versus A beta 42 interaction was further analyzed in the context of clinical pharmacokinetic dose exposure and central nervous system A beta 42 levels (i.e., pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic translation in humans).
   Results We observed a multi-ligand interaction of tramiprosate with monomeric A beta 42, which differs from the traditional 1:1 binding. This resulted in the stabilization of A beta 42 monomers and inhibition of oligomer formation and elongation, as demonstrated by IMS-MS and molecular dynamics. Using NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics, we also showed that tramiprosate bound to Lys16, Lys28, and Asp23, the key amino acid side chains of A beta 42 that are responsible for both conformational seed formation and neuronal toxicity. The projected molar excess of tramiprosate versus A beta 42 in humans using the dose effective in patients with AD aligned with the molecular stoichiometry of the interaction, providing a clear clinical translation of the MOA. A consistent alignment of these preclinical-to-clinical elements describes a unique example of translational medicine and supports the efficacy seen in symptomatic patients with AD. This unique "enveloping mechanism'' of tramiprosate also provides a potential basis for tramiprosate dose selection for patients with homozygous AD at earlier stages of disease.
   Conclusion We have identified the molecular mechanism that may account for the observed clinical efficacy of tramiprosate in patients with APOE4/4 homozygous AD. In addition, the integrated application of the molecular methodologies ( i.e., IMS-MS, NMR, and thermodynamics analysis) indicates that it is feasible to modulate and control the A beta 42 conformational dynamics landscape by a small molecule, resulting in a favorable A beta 42 conformational change that leads to a clinically relevant amyloid anti-aggregation effect and inhibition of oligomer formation. This novel enveloping MOA of tramiprosate has potential utility in the development of disease-modifying therapies for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases caused by misfolded proteins.

TI Was there German-Moravian literature in Briinn? About the genesis and
   structure of one or another literary field
SO ETUDES GERMANIQUES
AB In the paper, I attempt to map the development of the German -language literary field in Brno in the second half of the 19th century. Ifind three stages of development, which, however, are rather closely intertwined and do not confirm Bourdieu's (The Rules of Art) assumption that there was a sharp distinction of modernist authors and texts to the older representative authors of the "bourgeois" literature. In the first phase of the literary field after 1848, reading institutionalized as a widespread and prestigious activity. Around 1860, (Czech and German) reading clubs with a number of members were created and readers' - rather than authors' - magazines with predominantly translation texts were published, often in two language versions with the same publisher (e.g. Buschak / Btakk and Irrgang, Lese-StiThchen and Besidka etend'iskci). Authors of this period (e.g. Joseph C von Wieser, Ludwig Goldhann) recruit from higher middle class, but their plays and novels are widely accepted in the local context and their authors were worshiped. A particular "writers' literature" starts in the 1880s and is manifested both by collective literary projects (e.g. the last editions of the Moravia magazine, 1880, 1882 or the anthology Deutsches Dichterbuch aus Mahren, 1892) and by the institutionalization of the writer's state (Deutscher Journalisten- und Schriftstellerverein, since 1890). At this stage, the Brno literary field is already profiling itself as German and works more strongly with the notion of aesthetic autonomy of the text and the autonomous function of the "poet". The authors (e.g. Paul Strzemcha-Kirsch, Emil Soffe) operate mainly in the educated bourgeoisie (Bildungsbiirgertum). In the 1890s, modernist concepts of literature and authorship came in several streams into Brno's German literary life, for example through the naturalist Freie literarische Gesellschaft (1892-1894) or the "Musilian" generation around 1900. However, these currents are almost immediately integrated by the mainstream of local literary life, as shown by socio-cultural events or collective publications of that time (e.g. the anthology Mahrische Dichter, 1902).

TI Integrative Multi-Omics Analysis of Identified Ferroptosis-Marker RPL8
   as a Candidate Oncogene Correlates with Poor Prognosis and Immune
   Infiltration in Liver Cancer
SO COMBINATORIAL CHEMISTRY & HIGH THROUGHPUT SCREENING
AB Background Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (LIHC) is characterized by high malignancy, poor prognosis, and high recurrence rate worldwide. The role of ferroptosis in tumorigenesis and progression has been confirmed in previous studies. However, the multi-omics analysis in liver cancer of ferroptosis-markers RPL8 remains to be elucidated. Methods In this analysis, the RPL8 mRNA expression was analyzed via the GEPIA, TIMER and UALCAN databases. In addition, we verified the mRNA expression of RPL8 by qRT-PCR experiment. The Kaplan-Meier plotter, UALCAN, TCGAportal and HPA databases were applied to evaluate RPL8 on prognosis and clinicopathological parameters. Moreover, we used TIMER and Kaplan-Meier plotter to analyze the correlation of RPL8 to immune cell infiltration and immune cell type markers to prognosis. In addition, networks and function enrichment between RPL8 co-expression genes were analyzed by GeneMANIA, cBioportal and Metascape databases. What's more, we used FerrDb and GEPIA databases to analyze the correlation of 23 Ferroptosis-related genes with RPL8. Results The mRNA expression of RPL8 was over-expressed in multiple cancers. In addition, transcription and translation levels of RPL8 in LIHC were significantly higher than normal tissues. Furthermore, higher expression of RPL8 was closely related to shorter OS in LIHC patients. The analysis of Kaplan-Meier plotter proved that RPL8 expression was related to stage, Sorafenib treatment, alcohol consumption and hepatitis virus. Moreover, the results showed that the methylation expression level of RPL8 was significantly associated with age, gender, grade, stage and TP53 mutation of LIHC. RPL8 and its co-expression genes were primarily involved in liver regeneration and immune system process. Immune infiltration analysis showed the RPL8 expression had positively correlated with immune cells and immune subtypes in LIHC. Furthermore, qRT-PCR experiment validated the expression difference of RPL8 in liver cancer. Conclusion Our findings elucidated that ferroptosis-markers RPL8 may play an important role in prognosis, and significantly correlate with ferroptosis-related genes, it also revealed the potential of RPL8 as a novel therapeutic target for LIHC treatment and prognosis assessment.

TI The Shifting Appreciation of Hamlet in Its Japanese Novelizations: Hideo
   Kobayashi's Ophelia's Will and Its Revisions
SO MULTICULTURAL SHAKESPEARE-TRANSLATION APPROPRIATION AND PERFORMANCE
AB Hideo Kobayashi, who is today known as one of the most prominent literary critics of the Showa era in Japan, published Ophelia's Will in 1931 when he was still an aspiring novelist. This novella was an adaptation of Shakespeare's Hamlet, composed as a letter written by Ophelia to Hamlet before her enigmatic death in the original play. While the novel has previously been considered as a psychological novel that sought to illustrate the inner life of the Shakespearean heroine, this paper examines the process by which Kobayashi rediscovered Hamlet as a drama that foregrounds the impenetrability of the characters' inwardness and highlighted in Ophelia's Will his diversion from the psychological rendition of Ophelia. In so doing, the paper analyses the revisions Kobayashi continued to make to the novel even until the post-war era, especially when it was republished in 1933 and 1949. Though these revisions have rarely been discussed by the researchers, they demonstrate the essential changes made to the novel, mainly to its literary style, which corroborates Kobayashi's shifting interest and his developing interpretation of Shakespeare's works and Hamlet.

TI Global Analysis of Transcriptome and Translatome Revealed That
   Coordinated WNT and FGF Regulate the Carapacial Ridge Development of
   Chinese Soft-Shell Turtle
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB The turtle carapace is composed of severely deformed fused dorsal vertebrae, ribs, and bone plates. In particular, the lateral growth in the superficial layer of turtle ribs in the dorsal trunk causes an encapsulation of the scapula and pelvis. The recent study suggested that the carapacial ridge (CR) is a new model of epithelial-mesenchymal transition which is essential for the arrangement of the ribs. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the regulatory mechanism of carapacial ridge development to analyze the formation of the turtle shell. However, the current understanding of the regulatory network underlying turtle carapacial ridge development is poor due to the lack of both systematic gene screening at different carapacial ridge development stages and gene function verification studies. In this study, we obtained genome-wide gene transcription and gene translation profiles using RNA sequencing and ribosome nascent-chain complex mRNA sequencing from carapacial ridge tissues of Chinese soft-shell turtle at different development stages. A correlation analysis of the transcriptome and translatome revealed that there were 129, 670, and 135 codifferentially expressed genes, including homodirection and opposite-direction differentially expressed genes, among three comparison groups, respectively. The pathway enrichment analysis of codifferentially expressed genes from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes showed dynamic changes in signaling pathways involved in carapacial ridge development. Especially, the results revealed that the Wnt signaling pathway and MAPK signaling pathway may play important roles in turtle carapacial ridge development. In addition, Wnt and Fgf were expressed during the carapacial ridge development. Furthermore, we discovered that Wnt5a regulated carapacial ridge development through the Wnt5a/JNK pathway. Therefore, our studies uncover that the morphogenesis of the turtle carapace might function through the co-operation between conserved WNT and FGF signaling pathways. Consequently, our findings revealed the dynamic signaling pathways acting on the carapacial ridge development of Chinese soft-shell turtle and provided new insights into uncover the molecular mechanism underlying turtle shell morphogenesis.

TI Tolerance and Intolerance for Uncertainty as Predictors of Decision
   Making and Risk Acceptance in Gaming Strategies of The Iowa Gambling
   Task
SO PSYCHOLOGY IN RUSSIA-STATE OF THE ART
AB Background. This article reports on the results of an empirical study of interrelationships between indicators of decision-making strategies (indexed by the Iowa Gambling Task, IGT) and traits of tolerance and intolerance for uncertainty that capture the unity of cognitive and personality components of situational representations.
   Objective. Our study tested the hypothesis that overcoming uncertainty in decision making goes beyond cognitive representations of the task but instead is rooted in the construction of the amodal image of an uncertain situation that captures the meaning regulation of perception and action. We hypothesized that when a person is faced with multi-stage decisions, their strategies reflect the contribution of individual differences in attitudes towards uncertainty.
   Design. Using data obtained from n = 60 typically developing adults (68% men; M-age = 30.58), we examined the contribution of tolerance/intolerance for uncertainty to a variety of IGT dependent variables at five different stages of the game.
   Results. The data was analyzed using the mixed linear model method as implemented in the lme4 package for R. The results indicated that tolerance for uncertainty significantly contributes to the initial level of behavioral risk, ensuring readiness for decision making under uncertainty.
   Conclusion. Tolerance for uncertainty plays an important role in early stages of orientation in an uncertain modeled game situation, and contributes to the productive development of probabilistic expectations. Intolerance for uncertainty, on the other hand, was shown to contribute to risk in decision making after trial failure, potentially limiting learning in uncertain conditions through risk aversion.

TI An Alba-domain protein required for proteome remodelling during
   trypanosome differentiation and host transition
SO PLOS PATHOGENS
AB The transition between hosts is a challenge for digenetic parasites as it is unpredictable. For Trypanosoma brucei subspecies, which are disseminated by tsetse flies, adaptation to the new host requires differentiation of stumpy forms picked up from mammals to procyclic forms in the fly midgut. Here we show that the Alba-domain protein Alba3 is not essential for mammalian slender forms, nor is it required for differentiation of slender to stumpy forms in culture or in mice. It is crucial, however, for the development of T. brucei procyclic forms during the host transition. While steady state levels of mRNAs in differentiating cells are barely affected by the loss of Alba3, there are major repercussions for the proteome. Mechanistically, Alba3 aids differentiation by rapidly releasing stumpy forms from translational repression and stimulating polysome formation. In its absence, parasites fail to remodel their proteome appropriately, lack components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and show reduced infection of tsetse. Interestingly, Alba3 and the closely related Alba4 are functionally redundant in slender forms, but Alba4 cannot compensate for the lack of Alba3 during differentiation from the stumpy to the procyclic form. We postulate that Alba-domain proteins play similar roles in regulating translation in other protozoan parasites, in particular during life-cycle and host transitions.
   Author summary
   Trypanosoma brucei is a unicellular eukaryotic parasite that is responsible for African trypanosomiasis. The parasite needs two hosts, mammals and tsetse flies, in order to complete its life cycle. Throughout its developmental cycle, T. brucei encounters diverse environments to which it has to adapt in order to maintain its transmission and infectivity. Successful adaptation to the new environment and transition to different life-cycle stages are the general challenges faced by many digenetic parasites. In this study we show that the Alba-domain protein Alba3 is essential for differentiation of the mammalian stumpy form (transition form) to the procyclic form in the tsetse host. An Alba3 deletion mutant infects mice and shows characteristic waves of parasitaemia, but is severely compromised in its ability to infect tsetse flies. Stumpy forms are translationally repressed, but are poised to resume protein synthesis during differentiation. We show that Alba3 is key to efficient escape from translation repression; in its absence, there is a delay in the formation of polysomes and resumption of protein synthesis. This impacts the formation of procyclic-specific mitochondrial respiratory complex proteins as well as the repression of some bloodstream-specific proteins. This is the first time that a single protein has been shown to have a major influence on translation as an adaptive response to changing hosts. It is also the first time that a mechanism has been established for Alba-domain proteins in parasites.

TI Oncologic Imaging and Radiomics: A Walkthrough Review of Methodological
   Challenges
SO CANCERS
AB Simple Summary Radiomics could increase the value of medical images for oncologic patients, allowing for the identification of novel imaging biomarkers and building prediction models. Unfortunately, despite the many promises and encouraging findings, the translation of radiomics into clinical practice appears as a distant goal. Indeed, challenges such as generalizability and reproducibility are slowing down the process and must be faced with a rigorous and robust radiomic methodology. In this review, we turn the spotlight to the methodological complexity of radiomics, providing an outline of dos and don'ts aimed at facilitating state-of-the-art research. Imaging plays a crucial role in the management of oncologic patients, from the initial diagnosis to staging and treatment response monitoring. Recently, it has been suggested that its importance could be further increased by accessing a new layer of previously hidden quantitative data at the pixel level. Using a multi-step process, radiomics extracts potential biomarkers from medical images that could power decision support tools. Despite the growing interest and rising number of research articles being published, radiomics is still far from fulfilling its promise of guiding oncologic imaging toward personalized medicine. This is, at least partly, due to the heterogeneous methodological quality in radiomic research, caused by the complexity of the analysis pipelines. In this review, we aim to disentangle this complexity with a stepwise approach. Specifically, we focus on challenges to face during image preprocessing and segmentation, how to handle imbalanced classes and avoid information leaks, as well as strategies for the proper validation of findings.

TI Radiomics and machine learning applications in rectal cancer: Current
   update and future perspectives
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
AB The high incidence of rectal cancer in both sexes makes it one of the most common tumors, with significant morbidity and mortality rates. To define the best treatment option and optimize patient outcome, several rectal cancer biological variables must be evaluated. Currently, medical imaging plays a crucial role in the characterization of this disease, and it often requires a multimodal approach. Magnetic resonance imaging is the first-choice imaging modality for local staging and restaging and can be used to detect high-risk prognostic factors. Computed tomography is widely adopted for the detection of distant metastases. However, conventional imaging has recognized limitations, and many rectal cancer characteristics remain assessable only after surgery and histopathology evaluation. There is a growing interest in artificial intelligence applications in medicine, and imaging is by no means an exception. The introduction of radiomics, which allows the extraction of quantitative features that reflect tumor heterogeneity, allows the mining of data in medical images and paved the way for the identification of potential new imaging biomarkers. To manage such a huge amount of data, the use of machine learning algorithms has been proposed. Indeed, without prior explicit programming, they can be employed to build prediction models to support clinical decision making. In this review, current applications and future perspectives of artificial intelligence in medical imaging of rectal cancer are presented, with an imaging modality-based approach and a keen eye on unsolved issues. The results are promising, but the road ahead for translation in clinical practice is rather long.

TI Ensembles of protein termini and specific proteolytic signatures as
   candidate biomarkers of disease
SO PROTEOMICS CLINICAL APPLICATIONS
AB Early accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment are essential in order to treat complex or fatal diseases such as cancer and autoimmune, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. To realize this vision, new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers are urgently required. MS-based proteomics is the most promising approach for protein biomarker identification, but suffers in clinical translation of biomarker candidates that show only quantitative differences from normal tissue. Indeed, success in translating proteomic data to biomarkers in the clinic has been disappointing. Here, we propose that protein termini provide a new opportunity for biomarker discovery due to qualitative differences in intact and new protein termini between diseased and normal tissues. Altered proteolysis occurs in most pathologies. Diseaseand process-specific protein modifications, including proteolytic processing and subsequent modification of the terminal amino acids, frequently lead to altered protein activity that plays key roles in the disease process. Thus, mapping of ensembles of characteristic protein termini provides a proteolytic signature of high information content that shows both quantitative and most importantly qualitative differences in different diseases and stage of disease. These unique protein biomarkers have the added benefit of being mechanistically informative by revealing the activity state of the bioactive protein. Moreover, proteome-wide isolation of protein termini leads to generalized sample simplification, thereby enabling up to three orders of magnitude lower LODs compared to traditional shotgun proteomic approaches. We introduce the potential of protein termini for biomarker discovery, briefly review methods enabling large-scale studies of protein termini, and discuss how these may be integrated into a termini-oriented biomarker discovery pipeline from discovery to clinical application.

TI Induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR) suppresses porcine
   reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) replication
SO VIRUS RESEARCH
AB Replication of most RNA viruses is closely associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) within permissive cells. As such, viruses often induce tremendous amounts of stress on cells during viral replication. To cope with the stress, cells initiate the unfolded protein response (UPR) to promote cellular survival. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), an economically important swine pathogen, was previously shown to induce cellular stress at late stages post-infection resulting in the formation of stress granules (SGs). Here in this study, we demonstrate that PRRSV also induces additional cellular response pathways, including the UPR. Confocal microscopy analysis demonstrated significant morphological changes in the ER of PRRSV-infected cells, indicative of pronounced ER stress. Further investigation revealed induction of all three branches of the UPR, including eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha kinase 3 (PERK), serine-threonine protein kinase/endoribonuclease (IRE1), and cyclic AMP-dependent transcription factor (ATF6). Activation of these sensors resulted in significant transcriptional upregulation of downstream UPR effectors. Additionally, UPR activation was shown to be detrimental to PRRSV replication, as treatment of cells with chemical ER stress inducers potently suppressed viral replication and RNA synthesis. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms of UPR suppression of PRRSV replication revealed that PERK exacerbates the PRRSV-induced cytokine response. Collectively, these results demonstrate that PRRSV infection induces UPR activation through all three branches, and that UPR signaling may play a role in PRRSV pathogenesis. The results of this study further our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of PRRSV replication and host-pathogen interactions.

TI Comparative proteomic analysis of silkworm fat body after knocking out
   fibroin heavy chain gene: a novel insight into cross-talk between
   tissues
SO FUNCTIONAL & INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS
AB Cross-talk between tissues plays key roles in development of organisms; however, there are few researches on cross-talk between tissues in insects. Our previous studies showed that the pupal body weight was elevated after knocking out the fibroin heavy chain gene (BmFib-H), whereas the gene specifically expressed in silk glands of silkworm. Hence, the mutant is a good material for studying the cross-talk between tissues. It is considered that the fat body of silkworm during larval stage is used to store nutrients for pupal development. Herein, comparative proteomic of fat body on the 5th day of fifth instar was performed between BmFib-H gene knock-out Bombyx mori line (FGKO) and its wide-type Dazao. These results revealed that a single gene knock-out in silk gland triggered large-scale metabolic pathways changes in fat body. The levels of proteins involved in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate pathway, and glycine-serine biosynthetic pathway were down-regulated in the FGKO fat body. In contrast, the abundances of many proteins participating in protein synthesis, including ribosomal proteins, eukaryotic translation initiation factor, and elongation factor, were up-regulated. Moreover, the concentrations of glycogen and proteins in the FGKO fat body were greatly increased. These findings provided a novel insight into the cross-talk between silk gland and fat body in silkworm, and the presence of cross-talk between silk gland and fat body could regulate the redistribution of nutrients in the FGKO fat body leading to the increase of the pupal weight.

TI Enhancing insulin-use safety in hospitals: Practical recommendations
   from an ASHP Foundation expert consensus panel
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH-SYSTEM PHARMACY
AB Purpose. Consensus recommendations to help ensure safe insulin use in hospitalized patients are presented.
   Summary. Insulin products are frequently involved in medication errors in hospitals, and insulin is classified as a high-alert medication when used in inpatient settings. In an initiative to promote safer insulin use, the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) Research and Education Foundation convened a 21-member panel representing the fields of pharmacy, medicine, and nursing and consumer advocacy groups for a three-stage consensus-building initiative. The panel's consensus recommendations include the following: development of protocol-driven insulin order sets, elimination of the routine use of correction/sliding-scale insulin doses for management of hyperglycemia, restrictions on the types of insulin products stored in patient care areas, and policies to restrict the preparation of insulin bolus doses and i.v. infusions to the pharmacy department In addition, the panelists recommended that hospitals better coordinate insulin use with meal intake and glucose testing, prospectively monitor the coordination of insulin delivery and rates of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and provide standardized education and competency assessment for all hospital-based health care professionals responsible for insulin use.
   Conclusion. A 21-member expert panel convened by the ASHP Foundation identified 10 recommendations for enhancing insulin-use safety across the medication-use process in hospitals. Professional organizations, accrediting bodies, and consumer groups can play a critical role in the translation of these recommendations into practice. Rigorous research studies and program evaluations are needed to study the impact of implementation of these recommendations.

TI Metaproteomics reveals functional differences in intestinal microbiota
   development of preterm infants
SO MOLECULAR & CELLULAR PROTEOMICS
AB Objective: Development of the gastrointestinal tract and immune system can be modulated by the gut microbiota. Establishment of the intestinal microbiota, in its turn, is affected by host and environmental factors. As such, development of the gut microbiota is greatly impacted in preterm infants, who have an immature gut and are exposed to factors like hospitalization, caesarean section, antibiotics, and respiratory support.
   Design: We analyzed fecal microbiota composition and activity of ten preterm infants (gestational age 25-30 weeks; birthweight 630-1750 g) during the first six postnatal weeks through metaproteomics (LC-MS/MS) and 16S-rRNA gene sequencing.
   Results: A gestational-age-dependent microbial signature is observed, enabling microbiota-based differentiation between extremely preterm (25-27 weeks gestation) and very preterm (30 weeks gestation) infants. In very preterm infants, the intestinal microbiota developed toward a Bifidobacterium-dominated community and was associated with high abundance of proteins involved in carbohydrate and energy metabolism. Extremely preterm infants remained predominantly colonized by facultative anaerobes and were associated with proteins involved in membrane transport and translation. Delayed colonization by obligate anaerobes could be associated with antibiotic treatment and respiratory support.
   Conclusion: We speculate that gestational age and its associated intensity of care (e.g. antibiotics and respiratory support) affects intestinal microbiota composition and activity in preterm infants. As the gut microbiota plays a major role in development of the neonate, gestational age and its associated factors could set the stage for early and later life health complications via interference with microbiota development.

TI Low-Temperature Postfunctionalization of Highly Conductive Oxide
   Thin-Films toward Solution-Based Large-Scale Electronics
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB Although transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) have played a key role in a wide range of solid-state electronics from conventional optoelectronics to emerging electronic systems, the processing temperature and conductivity of solution-processed materials seem to be far exceeding the thermal limitations of soft materials and insufficient for high-perfomance large-area systems, respectively. Here, we report a strategy to form highly conductive and scalable solution-processed oxide materials and their successful translation into large-area electronic applications, which is enabled by photoassisted postfunctionalization at low temperature. The low-temperature fabrication of indium tin-oxide (ITO) thin films was achieved by using photoignited combustion synthesis combined with photoassisted reduction process under hydrogen atmosphere. It was noteworthy that the photochemically activated hydrogens on ITO surface could be triggered to facilitate highly crystalline oxygen deficient structure allowing significant increase of carrier concentration and mobility through film microstructure modifications. The low temperature postfunctionalized ITO films demonstrated conductivity of >1607 S/cm and sheet resistance of <104 Omega/square under the process temperature of less than 300 degrees C, which are comparable to those of vacuum-deposited and high-temperature annealed ITO films. Based on the photoassisted postfunctionalization route, all-solution-processed transparent metal-oxide thin-film transistors and large-area integrated circuits with the ITO bus lines were demonstrated, showing field-effect mobilities of >6.5 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) with relatively good operational stability and oscillation frequency of more than 1 MHz in 7-stage ring oscillators, respectively.

TI Increased Expression of FGF19 Contributes to Tumor Progression and Cell
   Motility of Human Thyroid Cancer
SO OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD AND NECK SURGERY
AB Objective Numerous reports indicate a role for aberrant expression of fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) in tumor development and progression, and several drugs have been developed to target it. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of FGF19 and examine whether it plays any roles in progression of thyroid cancer.
   Study Design Translation research.
   Setting Navy General Hospital of Chinese PLA, China.
   Subjects and Methods Expression patterns of FGF19 protein in 100 paired formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded cancerous and adjacent noncancerous tissues from patients with thyroid cancer were detected by immunohistochemistry. Then, in vitro migration and invasion assays of siRNA-targeted FGF19-transfected cells were performed.
   Results Positive immunostaining of FGF19 protein expression was localized in cytoplasm with or without membrane of malignant cells and was observed in 82 (82.0%) of 100 patients with thyroid cancer. Statistically, the expression level of FGF19 protein in thyroid cancer tissues was significantly higher than that in normal tissues. In addition, FGF19 overexpression was significantly associated with the advanced tumor node metastasis staging (P = .008), the presence of extrathyroidal invasion (P = .01), lymph nodes metastasis (P = .01), and distant metastasis (P = .02). Furthermore, knockdown of FGF19 by transfection of siRNA-FGF19 could efficiently suppress the migration and invasion abilities of thyroid cancer cells in vitro.
   Conclusion Our data revealed that the increased expression of FGF19 might be involved in the malignant behaviors of thyroid cancer, highlighting its potential as a molecular marker for early diagnosis and as a possible target for therapeutic intervention of this disease.

TI Production of anti TNF-alpha antibodies in eukaryotic cells using
   different combinations of vectors carrying heavy and light chains
SO CYTOTECHNOLOGY
AB Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) plays a key role in rheumatoid arthritis and some other autoimmune diseases. Therapy with anti-TNF-alpha recombinant antibodies (Ab) appears to be highly effective. Production of new hyper-producing eukaryotic cell lines can decrease the treatment cost, which currently is very high. However, due to the complexity of protein transcription, translation, processing, and secretion in mammalian cells, the stages at which antibody expression is affected are still poorly determined. The aim of this work was to compare the productivity of two cell lines developed in CHO DG44 cells, deficient in dihydrofolate reductase, transfected with vectors carrying either heavy (H) or light (L) chains of chimeric antibody under different combinations of selective elements. Both H and L chains were cloned either in pOptiVEC or pcDNA3.3 vectors and different combinations were used to produce HL and LH cell lines. We have shown that Ab production has been low and comparable between HL and LH cells until selection on methotrexate (MTX) when LH but not HL cells have responded with 3.5 times increased productivity. Flow cytometry analysis has demonstrated that intracellular concentration of full size Abs in LH cells was 5.6 times higher than in HL ones due to higher amount of H chain synthesis. No differences in viability between HL and LH cells have been found. We have concluded that the expression of H chain in the pOptiVEC vector, which is responsible for MTX resistance, has led to the suppression of H chain synthesis and limitation in full Ab assembly.

Here we analysed the spatiotemporal expression patterns of zebrafish (Danio rerio) pcbp2 (identical to pcbp1 and pcbp2 in mammals), pcbp3 and pcbp4 at various stages of zebrafish embryonic development by whole-mount in situ hybridization. Our results revealed that all pcbp genes are maternally expressed, especially pcbp2, which is strongly expressed from the embryogenetic stage to larva. The expression patterns of PCBP members are similar to each other at the very early developmental stage sharing with common strong expression in the intestine, otic vesicle, retina and brain of zebrafish. Subsequently, the messenger RNAs of PCBP members are gradually constrained and highly expressed in intestines of the larvae. Collectively, our study figured out the expression pattern of each PCBP member in diverse organogenesis during embryo development, indicating that PCBP members may play predominant roles in the development of neural and digestive systems to maintain their normal physiological functions. Moreover, the similar expression patterns at the developmental stages and organ types among this family suggest that the aberrant expression of these genes would lead to the neural or intestinal diseases.

TI Systemic dendrimer nanotherapies for targeted suppression of choroidal
   inflammation and neovascularization in age-related macular degeneration
SO JOURNAL OF CONTROLLED RELEASE
AB Inflammation and neovascularization are key pathological events in human age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Activated microglia/macrophages (mi/ma) and retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) play an active role in every stage of disease progression. Systemic therapies that can target these cells and address both inflammation and neovascularization will broaden the impact of existing therapies and potentially open new avenues for early AMD where there are no viable therapies. Utilizing a clinically relevant rat model of AMD that mirrors many aspects that of human AMD pathological events, we show that systemic hydroxyl-terminated polyamidoamine dendrimer-triamcinolone acetonide conjugate (D-TA) is selectively taken up by the injured mi/ma and RPE (without the need for targeting ligands). D-TA suppresses choroidal neovascularization significantly (by >80%, >50-fold better than free drug), attenuates inflammation in the choroid and retina, by limiting macrophage infiltration in the pathological area, significantly suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines and pro-angiogenic factors, with minimal side effects to healthy ocular tissue and other organs. In ex vivo studies on human postmortem diabetic eyes, the dendrimer is also taken up into choroidal macrophages. These results suggest that the systemic hydroxyl dendrimer-drugs can offer new avenues for therapies in treating early/dry AMD and late/neovascular AMD alone, or in combination with current anti-VEGF therapies. This hydroxyl dendrimer platform but conjugated to a different drug is undergoing clinical trials for severe COVID-19, potentially paving the way for faster clinical translation of similar compounds for ocular and retinal disorders.

TI The dual role of mir-146a in metastasis and disease progression
SO BIOMEDICINE & PHARMACOTHERAPY
AB Objective: MicroRNAs are ribonucleic acids that are single-stranded and endogenous non-coding acids that regulate gene expression in later stages of the translation process by binding to genomic regulatory sites. miR146a is mostly involved in the regulation of inflammatory systems and another process that role in the innate immune system. In the present review, we have focused on the recent acquisitions about the main role played by mir146a in the control of the immune system and tumorigenesis. The main purpose of this review article is to systematically investigate the mir146a and its role in regulating signaling pathways involved in cancer and the immune system as well as its involved therapeutic methods.
   Methods: Systematic search of MEDLINE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library was conducted for all comparative studies from 2000 to 2019 with the limitations of the English language.
   Results: For a notable period of time, researchers have mainly focused on the therapeutic mechanisms of mir146a involved in the modulation of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes. We found that levels of mir146a expression were associated with cancer cell metastasis as a dual role (Inhibitory and stimulatory roles). The results of various studies also showed that this microRNA has a therapeutic role through its effects on other gene expressions such as NF-kB, SIRT1, TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta and leads to disease control.
   Conclusion: Knowledge about alterations in mir146a regulation will give a better understanding of the molecular basis for various chronic inflammatory diseases and cancers.

TI Of Mice, Dogs, Pigs, and Men: Choosing the Appropriate Model for
   Immuno-Oncology Research
SO ILAR JOURNAL
AB The immune system plays dual roles in response to cancer. The host immune system protects against tumor formation via immunosurveillance; however, recognition of the tumor by immune cells also induces sculpting mechanisms leading to a Darwinian selection of tumor cell variants with reduced immunogenicity. Cancer immunoediting is the concept used to describe the complex interplay between tumor cells and the immune system. This concept, commonly referred to as the three E's, is encompassed by 3 distinct phases of elimination, equilibrium, and escape. Despite impressive results in the clinic, cancer immunotherapy still has room for improvement as many patients remain unresponsive to therapy. Moreover, many of the preclinical results obtained in the widely used mouse models of cancer are lost in translation to human patients.
   To improve the success rate of immuno-oncology research and preclinical testing of immune-based anticancer therapies, using alternative animal models more closely related to humans is a promising approach. Here, we describe 2 of the major alternative model systems: canine (spontaneous) and porcine (experimental) cancer models. Although dogs display a high rate of spontaneous tumor formation, an increased number of genetically modified porcine models exist. We suggest that the optimal immuno-oncology model may depend on the stage of cancer immunoediting in question. In particular, the spontaneous canine tumor models provide a unique platform for evaluating therapies aimed at the escape phase of cancer, while genetically engineered swine allow for elucidation of tumor-immune cell interactions especially during the phases of elimination and equilibrium.

TI Chez nous on the range: language, genre and the vernacular French
   Western (1956-61)
SO SCREEN
AB The representation of language invites critical attention commensurate with its importance as a constituent element of both sound film and national identity. The purpose of this essay is to isolate language's function as a mediator of cinematic experience, specifically how it regulates the flows and exchanges between a major Hollywood film genre and a localized context. The focus of the inquiry is the often overlooked genre of the French Western. Three Western-themed films made in France and in French within five years of each other - Fernand cow-boy (Guy LeFranc, 1956), S,r,nade au Texas/Serenade of Texas (Richard Poittier, 1958) and Dynamite Jack (Jean Bastia, 1961) - deliver a jolt of the unexpected when they represent English speech in French translation. They are arguably even more jarring when the spoken language on the American frontier represents diegetic French. Through the conspicuous placement in the Far West of native French-speaking characters played by well-known figures of the French stage and screen, these three French forerunners to better-known German and Italian Western cycles, each in its manner, represent the American West as a French-speaking region. The conceit destabilizes narrative, national and generic coherence with ambiguity and at times bald illogic, to the extent that it is often unclear if an utterance represents English or French speech. Less a reliable guarantor of either French' or Western' than a destabilizing agent, the representation of language drives, mediates and complicates the exchange between a globally circulating generic form and the response it activates in a specific context of production and reception.

TI Translanguaging and multilingual society of Macau: past, present and
   future
SO ASIAN-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF SECOND AND FOREIGN LANGUAGE EDUCATION
AB This paper aims to explore the development and evolution of multilingual languages in Macau over the past 400 years, as well as the relationship and interaction of these languages with Macau society. The complex relationship between translation and society in multilingual societies is also discussed. By doing so, this study attempts to fill the current research gap by investigating the formation and evolution of multilingualism in a multicultural context from a historical perspective. To understand the evolving changes in Macau's languages and the relationship with society at large, this paper provides a review of the evolution of the multilingual society in Macau from a historical perspective while analyzing the features of Macau's multiple languages in different historical periods and revealing the influence of multilingualism on Macau's development. This review argues that there are three stages in the formation of a multilingual society and culture in Macau: Chinese as the predominant language in Macau (ancient times-1553), the early introduction of foreign languages and the official status of Portuguese languages in Macau (1553-1987), and Chinese, Portuguese, and English as the three mainstream languages in Macau (1987-present). Through a review of the past for insights into the formation of the multilingual society in Macau, the paper sheds light on the long history of Macau's Chinese and Portuguese cultures and their main linguistic influence on Macau's society and culture. Findings reveal that Macau could utilize its Portuguese characteristics and play an influential role in world communications, bridging the gap between China and Portuguese-speaking countries.

TI Transgenerationally Precipitated Meiotic Chromosome Instability Fuels
   Rapid Karyotypic Evolution and Phenotypic Diversity in an Artificially
   Constructed Allotetraploid Wheat (AADD)
SO MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB Although a distinct karyotype with defined chromosome number and structure characterizes each biological species, it is intrinsically labile. Polyploidy or whole-genome duplication has played a pervasive and ongoing role in the evolution of all eukaryotes, and is the most dramatic force known to cause rapid karyotypic reconfiguration, especially at the initial stage. However, issues concerning transgenerational propagation of karyotypic heterogeneity and its translation to phenotypic diversity in nascent allopolyploidy, at the population level, have yet to be studied in detail. Here, we report a large-scale examination of transgenerationally propagated karyotypic heterogeneity and its phenotypic manifestation in an artificially constructed allotetraploid with a genome composition of AADD, that is, involving two of the three progenitor genomes of polyploid wheat. Specifically, we show that 1) massive organismal karyotypic heterogeneity is precipitated after 12 consecutive generations of selfing from a single euploid founder individual, 2) there exist dramatic differences in aptitudes between subgenomes and among chromosomes for whole-chromosome gain and/or loss and structural variations, 3) majority of the numerical and structural chromosomal variations are concurrent due to mutual contingency and possible functional constraint, 4) purposed and continuous selection and propagation for euploidy over generations did not result in enhanced karyotype stabilization, and 5) extent of karyotypic variation correlates with variability of phenotypic manifestation. Together, our results document that allopolyploidization catalyzes rampant and transgenerationally heritable organismal karyotypic heterogeneity that drives population-level phenotypic diversification, which lends fresh empirical support to the still contentious notion that whole-genome duplication enhances organismal evolvability.

TI Rapid and specific detection of Fusarium acuminatum and Fusarium solani
   associated with root rot on Astragalus membranaceus using loop-mediated
   isothermal amplification (LAMP)
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB Root rot, caused by several pathogens, is one of the most devastating diseases on Astragalus membranaceus, and can lead to serious yield loss. Fusarium acuminatum and F. solani are known to be major pathogens causing root rot of A. membranaceus in Shanxi Province, China. It is well-known that accurate identification of the pathogen and early diagnosis of the symptoms play a significantly important role to control this disease in the early or mid-term stage. Here, two new loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays were developed to detect F. acuminatum and F. solani based on the partial translation elongation factor-1 alpha (TEF-1 alpha) gene region. The LAMP products were successfully assessed by visual assessment using SYBR Green I, as well as electrophoresis on 2.0% agarose gel. The LAMP reactions for F. acuminatum and F. solani were performed under the optimized conditions of 63 degrees C and 62 degrees C for 60 min, respectively. The detection limit of LAMP assay was 100 fg/mu L for F. acuminatum and 1 pg/mu L for F. solani. Additionally, the two LAMP assays are highly specific to target Fusarium species, and could differentiate F. acuminatum and F. solani from other Fusarium species. In the field, the suspected diseased samples were used to verify the feasibility of the developed assays. As a result, the two rapid and specific LAMP assays could be applied for direct detection of F. acuminatum and F. solani on A. membranaceus, and precise diagnosis of A. membranaceus root rot caused by F. acuminatum and F. solani.

TI PolyAtailor: measuring poly(A) tail length from short-read and long-read
   sequencing data
SO BRIEFINGS IN BIOINFORMATICS
AB The poly(A) tail is a dynamic addition to the eukaryotic mRNA and the change in its length plays an essential role in regulating gene expression through affecting nuclear export, mRNA stability and translation. Only recently high-throughput sequencing strategies began to emerge for transcriptome-wide profiling of poly(A) tail length in diverse developmental stages and organisms. However, there is currently no easy-to-use and universal tool for measuring poly(A) tails in sequencing data from different sequencing protocols. Here we established PolyAtailor, a unified and efficient framework, for identifying and analyzing poly(A) tails from PacBio-based long reads or next generation short reads. PolyAtailor provides two core functions for measuring poly(A) tails, namely Tail_map and Tail_scan, which can be used for profiling tails with or without using a reference genome. Particularly, PolyAtailor can identify all potential tails in a read, providing users with detailed information such as tail position, tail length, tail sequence and tail type. Moreover, PolyAtailor integrates rich functions for poly(A) tail and poly(A) site analyses, such as differential poly(A) length analysis, poly(A) site identification and annotation, and statistics and visualization of base composition in tails. We compared PolyAtailor with three latest methods, FLAMAnalysis, FLEPSeq and PAIsoSeqAnalysis, using data from three sequencing protocols in HeLa samples and Arabidopsis. Results show that PolyAtailor is effective in measuring poly(A) tail length and detecting significance of differential poly(A) length, which achieves much higher sensitivity and accuracy than competing methods. PolyAtailor is available at https://github.com/BMILAB/PolyAtailor.

TI The Theatre of Photography: Dialogues
SO PHOTOGRAPHY AND CULTURE
AB Taking as a starting point the opposition of this journal's title, this introduction takes the form of a dialogue that is also an encounter between photography and theatre, a vantage point from which conceptual frameworks can be challenged and even collapsed. In the domains of photography and of theatre, much is made of artifice, authenticity, likeness, and liveness. Photography criticism has often emphasized the possibility or impossibility of veracity, the truthfulness or deceptiveness of photographs, with performance seemingly offering one escape route. Theatre, from the conceptualization of naturalism from the end of the nineteenth century to the challenge posed to it by performance art, has, despite itself being constituted of an eclectic technological representational apparatus, been seen to struggle with media, sometimes seeking refuge outside it. This introductory dialogue seeks to cast light on the various meeting points of the Theatre of Photography, then further explored in the co-written duologues in this volume.

TI Xenopus Piwi proteins interact with a broad proportion of the oocyte
   transcriptome
SO RNA
AB Piwi proteins utilize small RNAs (piRNAs) to recognize target transcripts such as transposable elements (TE). However, extensive piRNA sequence diversity also suggests that Piwi/piRNA complexes interact with many transcripts beyond TEs. To determine Piwi target RNAs, we used ribonucleoprotein-immunoprecipitation (RIP) and cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) to identify thousands of transcripts associated with the Piwi proteins XIWI and XILI (Piwi-protein-associated transcripts, PATs) from early stage oocytes of X. laevis and X. tropicalis. Most PATs associate with both XIWI and XILI and include transcripts of developmentally important proteins in oogenesis and embryogenesis. Only a minor fraction of PATs in both frog species displayed near perfect matches to piRNAs. Since predicting imperfect pairing between all piRNAs and target RNAs remains intractable, we instead determined that PAT read counts correlate well with the lengths and expression levels of transcripts, features that have also been observed for oocyte mRNAs associated with Drosophila Piwi proteins. We used an in vitro assay with exogenous RNA to confirm that XIWI associates with RNAs in a length-and concentration-dependent manner. In this assay, noncoding transcripts with many perfectly matched antisense piRNAs were unstable, whereas coding transcripts with matching piRNAs were stable, consistent with emerging evidence that Piwi proteins both promote the turnover of TEs and other RNAs, and may also regulate mRNA localization and translation. Our study suggests that Piwi proteins play multiple roles in germ cells and establishes a tractable vertebrate system to study the role of Piwi proteins in transcript regulation.

TI Between the Universal and the Local: Representations of Current Events
   in Lea Goldberg's Writings for Children During the British Mandate
SO ISRAEL STUDIES
AB Lea Goldberg played a pivotal role in the children literature arena during the Yishuv period. Beginning in 1936, only a year after her immigration to Mandatory Palestine, Goldberg served as associate-editor for Davar Leyeladim, the leading Hebrew children's weekly, published by the official newspaper of the Histadrut (the General Federation of Labor). Additionally, over 500 hundred of her works for children, including poems, stories, translations, essays, literary criticism for young readers, and even comic strips were published in the magazine. It was a tumultuous era. The Arab Revolt (1936-1939), the outbreak of WWII and the publication of the MacDonald White Paper of 1939 all exerted a direct impact on the Jewish communities in Palestine and abroad. These political and national crises of the day also greatly affected the educational and literary fields. Though most pieces in Davar Leyeladim touched on current events, Goldberg declared her unflagging commitment to aesthetic and humanistic universal values even in those anguished times. The poets' role, she claimed, is to remind their readers what is important and beautiful in the world. Her writings for children epitomized this approach at first, but gradually changed as the war in Europe intensified. The article explores Goldberg's unique treatment of current events in her writings for children, and her efforts to reconcile Labor Zionist ideals and aspirations with her own aesthetic convictions. The conflicts and contradictions between local and universal ideals engendered some of her most fascinating works for children that have not as yet assumed center stage in scholarly research.

TI Identification and Characterization of Shaker K+ Channel Gene Family in
   Foxtail Millet (Setaria italica) and Their Role in Stress Response
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB Potassium (K+) is one of the indispensable elements in plant growth and development. The Shaker K+ channel protein family is involved in plant K+ uptake and distribution. Foxtail millet (Setaria italica), as an important crop, has strong tolerance and adaptability to abiotic stresses. However, no systematic study focused on the Shaker K+ channel family in foxtail millet. Here, ten Shaker K+ channel genes in foxtail millet were identified and divided into five groups through phylogenetic analysis. Gene structures, chromosome locations, cis-acting regulatory elements in promoter, and post-translation modification sites of Shaker K+ channels were analyzed. In silico analysis of transcript level demonstrated that the expression of Shaker K+ channel genes was tissue or developmental stage specific. The transcription levels of Shaker K+ channel genes in foxtail millet under different abiotic stresses (cold, heat, NaCl, and PEG) and phytohormones (6-BA, BR, MJ, IAA, NAA, GA3, SA, and ABA) treatments at 0, 12, and 24 h were detected by qRT-PCR. The results showed that SiAKT1, SiKAT3, SiGORK, and SiSKOR were worth further research due to their significant responses after most treatments. The yeast complementation assay verified the inward K+ transport activities of detectable Shaker K+ channels. Finally, we found interactions between SiKAT2 and SiSNARE proteins. Compared to research in Arabidopsis, our results showed a difference in SYP121 related Shaker K+ channel regulation mechanism in foxtail millet. Our results indicate that Shaker K+ channels play important roles in foxtail millet and provide theoretical support for further exploring the K+ absorption mechanism of foxtail millet under abiotic stress.

TI Non-invasive imaging for studying anti-angiogenic therapy effects
SO THROMBOSIS AND HAEMOSTASIS
AB Noninvasive imaging plays an emerging role in preclinical and clinical cancer research and has high potential to improve clinical translation of new drugs. This article summarises and discusses tools and methods to image tumour angiogenesis and Monitor anti-angiogenic therapy effects. In this context, micro-computed tomography (mu CT) is recommended to visualise and quantify the micro-architecture of functional tumour vessels. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are favourable tools to assess functional vascular parameters, such as perfusion and relative blood volume. These functional parameters have been shown to indicate antiangiogenic therapy response at an early stage, before changes in tumour size appear. For tumour characterisation, the imaging of the molecular characteristics of tumour blood vessels, such as receptor expression, might have an even higher diagnostic potential and has been shown to be highly suitable for therapy monitoring as well. In this context, US using targeted microbubbles is currently evaluated in clinical trials as an important tool for the molecular characterisation of the angiogenic endothelium. Other modalities, being preferably used for molecular imaging of vessels and their surrounding stroma, are photoacoustic imaging (PAI), near-infrared fluorescence optical imaging (OI), MRI, positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The latter two are particularly useful if very high sensitivity is needed, and/or if the molecular target is difficult to access. Carefully considering the pros and cons of different imaging modalities in a multimodal imaging setup enables a comprehensive longitudinal assessment of the (micro)morphology, function and molecular regulation of tumour vessels.

TI Invisible in the smart city: Using participatory design methods for
   age-friendly solutions
SO FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE CITIES
AB Older adults face unique challenges and have differing needs when navigating the urban environment. At the same time, civil servants and policymakers in cities are facing difficulties in promoting age-friendly initiatives due to the lack of knowledge, data, and tools about and for older adults. In this context, smart cities can play a key role in increasing the participation of older adults (i.e., 65 years and older) by collecting the data needed to provide knowledge of and design tools for older adults. However, using smart city data to inform policy making is made more difficult by several existing issues such as aggregated nonage-specific big data, lack of data altogether, and a disparity in access and use of digital technology. This paper endeavors to provide a methodology to ensure that the older adults are represented in the collected data and the translation of this data into automatic policy-making decisions. The Participation for Policy for Older Adults (PAR4POA) method introduces older adults' perspectives from the start of the project and its iterative approach means that older adults will share their needs and values with policymakers at different stages of a project. The use of this method enabled the co-creation of smart city solutions targeted to address the needs of older citizens in the context of 3 European regions. The PAR4POA method is specifically altered for the situation of older adults but could easily be used to include other marginalized populations. Ensuring participation in the automatic policy-making arena will empower marginalized populations and provide representation in data previously not provided.

TI A Novel Quantitative Index of Meibomian Gland Dysfunction, the Meibomian
   Gland Tortuosity
SO TRANSLATIONAL VISION SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Purpose: To quantitatively measure meibomian gland (MG) tortuosity in meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) patients and normal controls and to observe the efficacy of evaluating MG tortuosity for the diagnosis of MGD.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled 32 obstructive MGD patients and 28 normal volunteers. Clinical assessments were performed, including symptom questionnaires, tear meniscus height, tear break-up time (TBUT), corneal fluorescein staining, lid margin abnormality, MG expressibility, and meibography. The meibomian gland tortuosity and meibomian gland density were measured by VIA software.
   Results: The mean age of the patients in the MGD group was 33.28 +/- 9.28 years, and that of the normal controls was 25.25 +/- 11.19 years. The average tortuosity of all MGs in the MGD patients was significantly larger than in the normal controls (P < 0.05). We further stratified the MGD patients into symptomatic MGD and asymptomatic groups. The average tortuosity of all MGs and of the central eight MGs was significantly higher in the symptomatic MGD patients than in the asymptomatic MGD patients (P < 0.05). Significant linear correlations were found between MG tortuosity and the lid margin score, meiboscore, meibum expressibility score, and TBUT (P < 0.05). When the diagnosis of obstructive MGD was based on the tortuosity of the central eight MGs of both eyelids, the sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 100%, respectively.
   Conclusions: MG tortuosity is an effective index to delineate MG morphology and to diagnose MGD, especially for the diagnosis of early-stage MGD.
   Translation Relevance: Calculating tortuosity quantitatively may play an important role in the diagnosis of MGD.

TI Deep learning based automatic segmentation of metastasis hotspots in
   thorax bone SPECT images
SO PLOS ONE
AB SPECT imaging has been identified as an effective medical modality for diagnosis, treatment, evaluation and prevention of a range of serious diseases and medical conditions. Bone SPECT scan has the potential to provide more accurate assessment of disease stage and severity. Segmenting hotspot in bone SPECT images plays a crucial role to calculate metrics like tumor uptake and metabolic tumor burden. Deep learning techniques especially the convolutional neural networks have been widely exploited for reliable segmentation of hotspots or lesions, organs and tissues in the traditional structural medical images (i.e., CT and MRI) due to their ability of automatically learning the features from images in an optimal way. In order to segment hotspots in bone SPECT images for automatic assessment of metastasis, in this work, we develop several deep learning based segmentation models. Specifically, each original whole-body bone SPECT image is processed to extract the thorax area, followed by image mirror, translation and rotation operations, which augments the original dataset. We then build segmentation models based on two commonly-used famous deep networks including U-Net and Mask R-CNN by fine-tuning their structures. Experimental evaluation conducted on a group of real-world bone SEPCT images reveals that the built segmentation models are workable on identifying and segmenting hotspots of metastasis in bone SEPCT images, achieving a value of 0.9920, 0.7721, 0.6788 and 0.6103 for PA (accuracy), CPA (precision), Rec (recall) and IoU, respectively. Finally, we conclude that the deep learning technology have the huge potential to identify and segment hotspots in bone SPECT images.

TI Alternative polyadenylation of the stacyose synthase gene mediates
   source-sink regulation in cucumber
SO JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY
AB Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a pervasive mechanism for gene regulation in eukaryotes. Stachyose is the main assimilate translocated in the cucumber phloem. Stachyose synthase (CsSTS) catalyzes the last step of stachyose biosynthesis in cucumber leaves and plays a key role in the regulation of assimilate partitioning between source and sink. In this study, three CsSTS mRNAs with the same open reading frame and the 5'untranslated region (UTR), but differing in their 3'UTRs, named CsSTS1 (short), CsSTS2 (medium), and CsSTS3 (long), were identified. Southern blot and sequence analysis of the cucumber genome confirmed that these transcripts are regulated through APA from a single gene. No significant difference of in vitro translation efficiency was found among three mRNAs. However, the relative stabilities of three transcripts varied among different tissues and different leaf development stages of cucumber. CsSTS1 expression in cucumber calli was upregulated by the raffinose (substrate of CsSTS) and down-regulated by stachyose (product of CsSTS), respectively. In cucumber plants, all three isoforms have considerable expression in non-fruit node leaves. However, in fruit-carrying node leaves, the expression of CsSTS2 and CsSTS3 was severely inhibited and only CsSTS1 was highly expressed, indicating fruit setting has a remarkable effect on the relative expression level of three transcripts. This "fruit setting" effect could be observed until at least 36 h after the fruit was removed from the node. Our results suggest that abundant expression of CsSTS1 is beneficial for stachyose loading in source leaves, and APA is a delicate mechanism for CsSTS to regulate cucumber source-sink balance.

TI Proteomic Profiling of Burkholderia cenocepacia Clonal Isolates with
   Different Virulence Potential Retrieved from a Cystic Fibrosis Patient
   during Chronic Lung Infection
SO PLOS ONE
AB Respiratory infections with Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) bacteria in cystic fibrosis (CF) are associated with a worse prognosis and increased risk of death. In this work, we assessed the virulence potential of three B. cenocepacia clonal isolates obtained from a CF patient between the onset of infection (isolate IST439) and before death with cepacia syndrome 3.5 years later (isolate IST4113 followed by IST4134), based on their ability to invade epithelial cells and compromise epithelial monolayer integrity. The two clonal isolates retrieved during late-stage disease were significantly more virulent than IST439. Proteomic profiling by 2-D DIGE of the last isolate recovered before the patient's death, IST4134, and clonal isolate IST439, was performed and compared with a prior analysis of IST4113 vs. IST439. The cytoplasmic and membrane-associated enriched fractions were examined and 52 proteins were found to be similarly altered in the two last isolates compared with IST439. These proteins are involved in metabolic functions, nucleotide synthesis, translation and protein folding, cell envelope biogenesis and iron homeostasis. Results are suggestive of the important role played by metabolic reprogramming in the virulence potential and persistence of B. cenocepacia, in particular regarding bacterial adaptation to microaerophilic conditions. Also, the content of the virulence determinant AidA was higher in the last 2 isolates. Significant levels of siderophores were found to be secreted by the three clonal isolates in an iron-depleted environment, but the two late isolates were more tolerant to low iron concentrations than IST439, consistent with the relative abundance of proteins involved in iron uptake.

TI A review into deep learning techniques for spoken language
   identification
SO MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
AB Information Technology has touched new vistas for a couple of decades mostly to simplify the day-to-day life of the humans. One of the key contributions of Information Technology is the application of Artificial Intelligence to achieve better results. The advent of artificial intelligence has given rise to a new branch of Natural Language Processing (NLP) called Computational Linguistics, which generates frameworks for intelligently manipulating spoken language knowledge and has brought human-machine onto a new stage. In this context, speech has arisen to be one of the imperative forms of interfaces, which is the basic mode of communication for us, and generally the most preferred one. Language identification, being the front-end for various natural language processing tasks, plays an important role in language translation. Owing to this, the focus has been given on the field of speech recognition involving the identification & recognition of languages by a machine. Spoken language identification is the identification of language present in a speech segment despite its size (duration & speed), ambiance (topic & emotion), and moderator (gender, age, demographic region). This paper has investigated various existing spoken language identification models implemented using different deep learning approaches, datasets, and performance measures utilized for their analysis. It also highlights the main features and challenges faced by these models. A comprehensive comparative study of deep learning techniques has been carried out for spoken language identification. Moreover, this review analyzes the efficiency of the spoken language models that can help the researchers to propose new language identification models for speech signals.

TI Quantitative MRI for Assessment of Treatment Outcomes in a Rabbit VX2
   Hepatic Tumor Model
SO JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING
AB Globally, primary and secondary liver cancer is one of the most common cancer types, accounting 8.2% of deaths worldwide in 2018. One of the key strategies to improve the patient's prognosis is the early diagnosis, when liver function is still preserved. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the typical wash-in/wash-out pattern in conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reaches a sensitivity of 60% and specificity of 96-100%. However, in recent years functional MRI sequences such as hepatocellular-specific gadolinium-based dynamic-contrast enhanced MRI, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) have been demonstrated to improve the evaluation of treatment success and thus the therapeutic decision-making and the patient's outcome. In the preclinical research setting, the VX2 liver rabbit tumor, which once originated from a virus-induced anaplastic squamous cell carcinoma, has played a longstanding role in experimental interventional oncology. Especially the high tumor vascularity allows assessing the treatment response of locoregional interventions such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and transcatheter arterial embolization (TACE). Functional MRI has been used to monitor the tumor growth and viability following interventional treatment. Besides promising results, a comprehensive overview of functional MRI sequences used so far in different treatment setting is lacking, thus lowering the comparability of study results. This review offers a comprehensive overview of study protocols, results, and limitations of quantitative MRI sequences applied to evaluate the treatment outcome of VX2 hepatic tumor models, thus generating a unique basis for future MRI studies and potential translation into the clinical setting.

TI Computer-guided drug repurposing: Identification of trypanocidal
   activity of clofazimine, benidipine and saquinavir
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
AB In spite of remarkable advances in the knowledge on Trypanosoma cruzi biology, no medications to treat Chagas disease have been approved in the last 40 years and almost 8 million people remain infected. Since the public sector and non-profit organizations play a significant role in the research efforts on Chagas disease, it is important to implement research strategies that promote translation of basic research into the clinical practice. Recent international public-private initiatives address the potential of drug repositioning (i.e. finding second or further medical uses for known-medications) which can substantially improve the success at clinical trials and the innovation in the pharmaceutical field.
   In this work, we present the computer-aided identification of approved drugs clofazimine, benidipine and saquinavir as potential trypanocidal compounds and test their effects at biochemical as much as cellular level on different parasite stages. According to the obtained results, we discuss biopharmaceutical, toxicological and physiopathological criteria applied to decide to move clofazimine and benidipine into preclinical phase, in an acute model of infection. The article illustrates the potential of computer-guided drug repositioning to integrate and optimize drug discovery and preclinical development; it also proposes rational rules to select which among repositioned candidates should advance to investigational drug status and offers a new insight on clofazimine and benidipine as candidate treatments for Chagas disease.

TI E3 ubiquitin ligases in cancer stem cells: key regulators of cancer
   hallmarks and novel therapeutic opportunities
SO CELLULAR ONCOLOGY
AB BackgroundHuman malignancies are composed of heterogeneous subpopulations of cancer cells with phenotypic and functional diversity. Among them, a unique subset of cancer stem cells (CSCs) has both the capacity for self-renewal and the potential to differentiate and contribute to multiple tumor properties. As such, CSCs are promising cellular targets for effective cancer therapy. At the molecular level, hyper-activation of multiple stemness regulatory signaling pathways and downstream transcription factors play critical roles in controlling CSCs establishment and maintenance. To regulate CSC properties, these stemness pathways are controlled by post-translational modifications including, but not limited to phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, and ubiquitination.ConclusionIn this review, we focus on E3 ubiquitin ligases and their roles and mechanisms in regulating essential hallmarks of CSCs, such as self-renewal, invasion and metastasis, metabolic reprogramming, immune evasion, and therapeutic resistance. Moreover, we discuss emerging therapeutic approaches to eliminate CSCs through targeting E3 ubiquitin ligases by chemical inhibitors and proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTACs) which are currently under development at the discovery, preclinical, and clinical stages. Several outstanding issues such as roles for E3 ubiquitin ligases in heterogeneity and phenotypical/functional evolution of CSCs remain to be studied under pathologically and clinically relevant conditions. With the rapid application of functional genomic and proteomic approaches at single cell, spatiotemporal, and even single molecule levels, we anticipate that more specific and precise functions of E3 ubiquitin ligases will be delineated in dictating CSC properties. Rational design and proper translation of these mechanistic understandings may lead to novel therapeutic modalities for cancer procession medicine.

TI Franz Anton Mesmer : magnetiser, moralist, and republican
SO ANNALES HISTORIQUES DE LA REVOLUTION FRANCAISE
AB This article reevaluates the political dimension of the work of Mesmer, showing the involvement of the founder of animal magnetism in the conflicts of his time. The first part of the article is devoted to his action during the Revolution. During his stay in the Austrian capital between 1790 and 1793, Mesmer played an important role in the 'jacobin plot'' of Vienna. His return to Paris in 1798 marked his return to the political scene. Mesmer attempted at this time, without any success, to make his conceptions known to the public not only his doctrine of animal magnetism, but also his theories about the nature of man and organization of society. These ideas were finally published in German translation in 1814, and greeted with general indifference. The second part of the article, focusing on the period before the Revolution, examines the genesis of Mesmer's political and moral ideas; these were developed by stages, even if his doctrine of animal magnetism still appeared confined to the medical sphere. Born within the framework of Viennese medicine, influenced by Enlightened Despotism, Mesmer's ideas took a critical turn during his stay in Paris, when animal magnetism became a public passion. It was then that the unifying theme of harmony developed as an essential part of the doctrine of animal magnetism. Finally, the last part of the article investigates the very content of Mesmer's moral and political theories, as these were expressed first in the lessons of 1784, then expanded in his later publications.

TI Cryptosporidium parvum Elongation Factor 1 alpha Participates in the
   Formation of Base Structure at the Infection Site During Invasion
SO JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB Background. Cryptosporidium is a genus of apicomplexan parasites, the causative agents of cryptosporidiosis in humans and/or animals. Although most apicomplexans parasitize within the host cell cytosols, Cryptosporidium resides on top of host cells, but it is embraced by a double-layer parasitophorous vacuole membrane derived from host cell. There is an electron-dense band to separate the parasite from host cell cytoplasm, making it as an intracellular but extracytoplasmic parasite. However, little is known on the molecular machinery at the host cell-parasite interface.
   Methods. Cryptosporidium parvum at various developmental stages were obtained by infecting HCT-8 cells cultured in vitro. Immunofluorescence assay was used to detect CpEF1 alpha with a polyclonal antibody and host cell F-actin with rhodamine-phalloidin. Recombinant CpEF1 alpha protein was used to evaluate its effect on the invasion by the parasite.
   Results. We discovered that a C parvum translation elongation factor 1 alpha (CpEF1 alpha) was discharged from the invading sporozoites into host cells, forming a crescent-shaped patch that fully resembles the electron-dense band. At the same time, host cell F-actin aggregated to form a globular-shaped plug beneath the CpEF1 alpha patch. The CpEF1 alpha patch remained for most of the time but became weakened and dissolved upon the completion of the invasion process. In addition, recombinant CpEF1 alpha protein could effectively interfere the invasion of sporozoites into host cells.
   Conclusions. CpEF1 alpha plays a role in the parasite invasion by participating in the formation of electron-dense band at the base of the parasite infection site.

TI An Evaluation Model for Measuring the Usability of Mobile Office
   Applications through User Interface Design Metrics
SO MEHRAN UNIVERSITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Usage of mobile devices and particularly smart phones has seen an enormous hike due to the advancement of mobile phone technology in recent times. People of different age groups, one way or the other, are now connected to different mobile phone applications, such as, Social Networking, Chatting, VoIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) applications, Gaming etc. This rapid advancement has made it necessary for user interface designers of mobile applications to design user friendly interfaces for their applications, so that users can interact and use those applications with ease irrespective of their location. Usability plays a vital role for measuring the usefulness of such applications. After examining different experimental studies on usability assessment techniques imparted by various research workers, it has been determined that there is still a great deal of requirement where application designers have to guarantee more adept and improved usability of offline mobile applications, such as, Conversion Apps, offline encyclopedia, Translation apps, business use applications (office applications) etc. The primary objective of this study is to render a model for usability metrics of measuring the usability of office applications for smart phones. The effectiveness, usefulness and reliability of the proposed model is measured through two office applications named Office Suite Pro7 for Android and Office 365 for Windows 8 touch screen Smartphone.The results of usability testing and t-test show the significance of the proposed approach. The model in this study will enable the application designers to guarantee a more adept and enhanced usability of office applications for smart phones during the designing stage.

TI Macrophage-tumor cell interactions regulate the function of nitric oxide
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY
AB Tumor cell-macrophage interactions change as the tumor progresses, and the generation of nitric oxide (NO) by the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) plays a major role in this interplay. In early stages, macrophages employ their killing mechanisms, particularly the generation of high concentrations of NO and its derivative reactive nitrogen species (RNS) to initiate tumor cell apoptosis and destroy emerging transformed cells. If the tumor escapes the immune system and grows, macrophages that infiltrate it are reprogramed in situ by the tumor microenvironment. Low oxygen tensions (hypoxia) and immunosuppressive cytokines inhibit iNOS activity and lead to production of low amounts of NO/RNS, which are pro-angiogenic and support tumor growth and metastasis by inducing growth factors (e.g., VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). We review here the different roles of NO/RNS in tumor progression and inhibition, and the mechanisms that regulate iNOS expression and NO production, highlighting the role of different subtypes of macrophages and the microenvironment. We finally claim that some tumor cells may become resistant to macrophage-induced death by increasing their expression of microRNA-146a (miR-146a), which leads to inhibition of iNOS translation. This implies that some cooperation between tumor cells and macrophages is required to induce tumor cell death, and that tumor cells may control their fate. Thus, in order to induce susceptibility of tumors cells to macrophage-induced death, we suggest a new therapeutic approach that couples manipulation of miR-146a levels in tumors with macrophage therapy, which relies on ex vivo stimulation of macrophages and their re introduction to tumors.

TI Coproducts of algae and yeast-derived single cell oils: A critical
   review of their role in improving biorefinery sustainability
SO BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB Oleaginous microalgae and yeast are of increasing interest as a renewable resource for single cell oils (SCOs). These have applications in fuels, feed and food products. In order to become cost competitive with existing terrestrial oils, a biorefinery approach is often taken where several product streams are valorised alongside the SCO. Whilst many life cycle assessment (LCA) and Techno-economic (TEA) studies have employed this biorefinery approach to SCO production, a systematic analysis of their implications is missing. This review evaluates the economic and environmental impacts associated with the use of coproducts. Overall, protein production plays the greatest role in determining viability, with coproduct strategy crucial to considering in the early stages of research and development.

TI Direct full-length RNA sequencing reveals unexpected transcriptome
   complexity during Caenorhabditis elegans development
SO GENOME RESEARCH
AB d Massively parallel sequencing of the polyadenylated RNAs has played a key role in delineating transcriptome complexity, including alternative use of an exon, promoter, 5' or 3' splice site or polyadenylation site, and RNA modification. However, reads derived from the current RNA-seq technologies are usually short and deprived of information on modification, compromising their potential in defining transcriptome complexity. Here, we applied a direct RNA sequencing method with ultralong reads using Oxford Nanopore Technologies to study the transcriptome complexity in Caenorhabditis elegans. We generated approximately six million reads using native poly(A)-tailed mRNAs from three developmental stages, with average read lengths ranging from 900 to 1100 nt. Around half of the reads represent full-length transcripts. To utilize the full-length transcripts in defining transcriptome complexity, we devised a method to classify the long reads as the same as existing transcripts or as a novel transcript using sequence mapping tracks rather than existing intron/exon structures, which allowed us to identify roughly 57,000 novel isoforms and recover at least 26,000 out of the 33,500 existing isoforms. The sets of genes with differential expression versus differential isoform usage over development are largely different, implying a fine-tuned regulation at isoform level. We also observed an unexpected increase in putative RNA modification in all bases in the coding region relative to the UTR, suggesting their possible roles in translation. The RNA reads and the method for read classification are expected to deliver new insights into RNA processing and modification and their underlying biology in the future.

TI Reterritorialization and aesthetic transformations: the case of Tony
   Harrison's Phaedra Britannica and The Misanthrope
SO PERSPECTIVES-STUDIES IN TRANSLATION THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB This article analyses the impact of reterritorialization on classics of the stage. After reflecting on some particularities of classical works, the article focuses on The Misanthrope and Phaedra Britannica by British poet Tony Harrison, the first and rare successes of Moliere, and particularly Racine on the Anglo-Saxon stage. It compares the main aesthetic features of Moliere's and Racine's works with the modernizations operated by Harrison, and comments on the relevance of the historical and geographical transfer as a domestication strategy. While reterritorialization strategically includes the spectator, it does so not without a major impact on certain characteristics of seventeenth-century French theatre. The fact that the plays have a strong aesthetic identity makes the transformations striking. Indeed, what makes up the identity of classical French theatre, namely the unity of action, characterization, passions and, more generally, the nature of comedy and tragedy, is transformed by reterritorialization. Also dependent on reterritorialization, dramatic language, notably rhythm, semantics and versification, is metamorphosed. These two case studies on the impact of historical and geographical transfer shed light on the points of disparity between classical French theatre and expectations of the modern English audience, and help to address other reterritorialized adaptations of classics.

TI Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Positron Emission Tomography Approaches
   to Imaging Vascular and Cardiac Inflammation
SO CIRCULATION JOURNAL
AB Inflammation plays a significant role in a wide range of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The numerous implications of inflammation in all steps of CVDs, including initiation, progression and complications, have prompted the emergence of noninvasive imaging modalities as diagnostic, prognostic and monitoring tools. In this review, we first synthesize the existing evidence on the role of inflammation in vascular and cardiac diseases, in order to identify the main targets used in noninvasive imaging. We chose to focus on positron emission tomographic (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, which offer the greatest potential of translation and clinical application. We detail the main preclinical and clinical studies in the following CVDs: coronary and vascular atherosclerosis, abdominal aortic aneurysms, myocardial infarction, myocarditis, and acute heart transplant rejection. We highlight the potential complementary roles of these imaging modalities, which are currently being studied in the emerging technology of PET/MRI. Finally, we provide a perspective on innovations and future applications of noninvasive imaging of cardiovascular inflammation.

TI Loss of Ribosomal Protein Paralog Rpl22-like1 Blocks Lymphoid
   Development without Affecting Protein Synthesis
SO JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY
AB Ribosomal proteins are thought to primarily facilitate biogenesis of the ribosome and its ability to synthesize protein. However, in this study, we show that Rpl22-like1 (Rpl22l1) regulates hematopoiesis without affecting ribosome biogenesis or bulk protein synthesis. Conditional loss of murine Rpl22l1 using stage or lineage-restricted Cre drivers impairs development of several hematopoietic lineages. Specifically, Tie2-Cre-mediated ablation of Rpl22l1 in hemogenic endothelium impairs the emergence of embryonic hematopoietic stem cells. Ablation of Rpl22l1 in late fetal liver progenitors impairs the development of B lineage progenitors at the pre-B stage and development of T cells at the CD44(-)CD25(+) double-negative stage. In vivo labeling with O-propargyl-puromycin revealed that protein synthesis at the stages of arrest was not altered, indicating that the ribosome biogenesis and function were not generally compromised. The developmental arrest was associated with p53 activation, suggesting that the arrest may be p53-dependent. Indeed, development of both B and T lymphocytes was rescued by p53 deficiency. p53 induction was not accompanied by DNA damage as indicated by phospho-gamma H2AX induction or endoplasmic reticulum stress, as measured by phosphorylation of EIF2 alpha, thereby excluding the known likely p53 inducers as causal. Finally, the developmental arrest of T cells was not rescued by elimination of the Rpl22l1 paralog, Rpl22, as we had previously found for the emergence of hematopoietic stem cells. This indicates that Rpl22 and Rpl22l1 play distinct and essential roles in supporting B and T cell development.

TI How European primary care practitioners think the timeliness of cancer
   diagnosis can be improved: a thematic analysis
SO BMJ OPEN
AB Background National European cancer survival rates vary widely. Prolonged diagnostic intervals are thought to be a key factor in explaining these variations. Primary care practitioners (PCPs) frequently play a crucial role during initial cancer diagnosis; their knowledge could be used to improve the planning of more effective approaches to earlier cancer diagnosis.
   Objectives This study sought the views of PCPs from across Europe on how they thought the timeliness of cancer diagnosis could be improved.
   Design In an online survey, a final open-ended question asked PCPs how they thought the speed of diagnosis of cancer in primary care could be improved. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data.
   Setting A primary care study, with participating centres in 20 European countries.
   Participants A total of 1352 PCPs answered the final survey question, with a median of 48 per country.
   Results The main themes identified were: patient-related factors, including health education; care provider-related factors, including continuing medical education; improving communication and interprofessional partnership, particularly between primary and secondary care; factors relating to health system organisation and policies, including improving access to healthcare; easier primary care access to diagnostic tests; and use of information technology. Re-allocation of funding to support timely diagnosis was seen as an issue affecting all of these.
   Conclusions To achieve more timely cancer diagnosis, health systems need to facilitate earlier patient presentation through education and better access to care, have well-educated clinicians with good access to investigations and better information technology, and adequate primary care cancer diagnostic pathway funding.

TI Sex Differences in Neoplastic Progression in Barrett's Esophagus: A
   Multicenter Prospective Cohort Study
SO CANCERS
AB Simple Summary Barrett's esophagus (BE) is the only known precursor lesion of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Endoscopic surveillance plays an important role in the timely detection of neoplastic progression. However, the cost-effectiveness of current surveillance strategies is debatable. Previous studies have shown that male Barrett's patients have lower neoplastic progression risk than females. However, these studies do not provide a more practical translation of these sex disparities into different surveillance intervals. The current multicenter prospective cohort study aimed to evaluate sex differences in 868 BE patients; not only with respect to neoplastic progression risk, but also concerning the difference in time to detection of high-grade dysplasia (HGD)/EAC: time to neoplastic progression was estimated to be almost twice as low in males than in females. In contrast, the stage of neoplasia appeared to be higher in females. Our results can guide future discussions for sex-specific guidelines, supporting the implementation of neoplastic risk stratification per individual patient in BE surveillance. Recommendations in Barrett's esophagus (BE) guidelines are mainly based on male patients. We aimed to evaluate sex differences in BE patients in (1) probability of and (2) time to neoplastic progression, and (3) differences in the stage distribution of neoplasia. We conducted a multicenter prospective cohort study including 868 BE patients. Cox regression modeling and accelerated failure time modeling were used to estimate the sex differences. Neoplastic progression was defined as high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and/or esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Among the 639 (74%) males and 229 females that were included (median follow-up 7.1 years), 61 (7.0%) developed HGD/EAC. Neoplastic progression risk was estimated to be twice as high among males (HR 2.26, 95% CI 1.11-4.62) than females. The risk of HGD was found to be higher in males (HR 3.76, 95% CI 1.33-10.6). Time to HGD/EAC (AR 0.52, 95% CI 0.29-0.95) and HGD (AR 0.40, 95% CI 0.19-0.86) was shorter in males. Females had proportionally more EAC than HGD and tended to have higher stages of neoplasia at diagnosis. In conclusion, both the risk of and time to neoplastic progression were higher in males. However, females were proportionally more often diagnosed with (advanced) EAC. We should strive for improved neoplastic risk stratification per individual BE patient, incorporating sex disparities into new prediction models.

TI Challenges in Cross-Cultural Communication in Breast Cancer Surgery: Is
   there a Gender Gap?
SO JOURNAL OF CANCER EDUCATION
AB The aim of this study is to identify [1] facilitators and barriers to cross-cultural communication with Canadian immigrants during the breast cancer (BC) surgical consultation and [2] the impact of cultural sensitivity training on the perception of cross-cultural communication barriers. A 29-item questionnaire mailed to 450 surgeons was developed based on the Ottawa Decision Support Framework, informed by interviews with BC practitioners and a literature review. The inclusion criteria are English-speaking general surgeons practicing in Vancouver, Montreal, and Toronto, home to > 60% of Canada's immigrant population. The association between surgeon characteristics and barriers to communication was assessed using the chi-square or Fisher's exact test. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models estimated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association between frequent perception of each barrier to communication and gender, career stage, and percentage of foreign-born patients. Between June and September 2017, 130 surveys were returned for a 29% response rate. The majority of practitioners reported experiencing language barriers in consultation with immigrant patients (71.4%). In the patient-provider relationship, the most commonly reported barrier was the patient's lack of medical understanding (81.4%). At the system level, the absence of a relative for translation was the most frequently encountered challenge (77.1%). On multivariable analysis adjusting for career stage and percentage of foreign-born patients, female gender of a surgeon was associated with more frequent perception of barriers related to language (OR 4.91, [95% CI 1.43, 16.82; p = 0.0114]), the patient's desired role in decision-making (OR 3.000 [95% CI 1.116-8.059; p = 0.0294]), and poor access to interpreters (OR 3.63 [95% CI 1.24, 10.64; p = 0.0189]). Furthermore, on multivariable analysis adjusting for gender and career stage, surgeons identified as having < 25% foreign-born patients in their practice were less likely to identify communication barriers due to the patients' perception and understanding of their healthcare (OR 0.32 [95% CI 0.11, 0.95; p = 0.041]). Cultural sensitivity training did not appear to be an influential factor though this may be due to the low number of surgeons who received training (5.7%). There are multiple cross-cultural communication challenges. Gender, years in practice, and the cultural diversity of a practice might play significant roles in the identification and perception of these barriers.

TI Unveiling the Role of the Integrated Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress
   Response in Leishmania Infection - Future Perspectives
SO FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
AB The integrated endoplasmic reticulum stress response (IERSR) is an evolutionarily conserved adaptive mechanism that ensures endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis and cellular survival in the presence of stress including nutrient deprivation, hypoxia, and imbalance of Ca+ homeostasis, toxins, and microbial infection. Three transmembrane proteins regulate integrated signaling pathways that comprise the IERSR, namely, IRE-1 that activates XBP-1, the pancreatic ER kinase (PERK) that phosphorylates the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 and transcription factor 6 (ATF6). The roles of IRE-1, PERK, and ATF4 in viral and some bacterial infections are well characterized. The role of IERSR in infections by intracellular parasites is still poorly understood, although one could anticipate that IERSR may play an important role on the host's cell response. Recently, our group reported the important aspects of XBP-1 activation in Leishmania amazonensis infection. It is, however, necessary to address the relevance of the other IERSR branches, together with the possible role of IERSR in infections by other Leishmania species, and furthermore, to pursue the possible implications in the pathogenesis and control of parasite replication in macrophages.

TI Multipathway synergy promotes testicular transition from growth to
   spermatogenesis in early-puberty goats
SO BMC GENOMICS
AB Background The microscopic process of postnatal testicular development in early-puberty animals is poorly understood. Therefore, in this study, 21 male Yiling goats with average ages of 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 days old (each age group comprised three goats) were used to study the changes in organs, tissues and transcriptomes during postnatal testicle development to obtain a broad and deep insight into the dynamic process of testicular transition from growth to spermatogenesis in early-puberty animals. Results The inflection point of testicular weight was at 119 days postpartum (dpp), and the testicular weight increased rapidly from 119 dpp to 150 dpp. Spermatozoa were observed in the testis at 90 dpp by using haematoxylin-eosin staining. We found from the transcriptome analysis of testes that the testicular development of Yiling goat from birth to 180 dpp experienced three stages, namely, growth, transition and spermatogenesis stages. The goats in the testicular growth stage (0-60 dpp) showed a high expression of growth-related genes in neurogenesis, angiogenesis and cell junction, and a low expression of spermatogenesis-related genes. The goats aged 60-120 dpp were in the transitional stage which had a gradually decreased growth-related gene transcription levels and increased spermatogenesis-related gene transcription levels. The goats aged 120-180 dpp were in the spermatogenesis stage. At this stage, highly expressed spermatogenesis-related genes, downregulated testicular growth- and immune-related genes and a shift in the focus of testicular development into spermatogenesis were observed. Additionally, we found several novel hub genes, which may play key roles in spermatogenesis, androgen synthesis and secretion, angiogenesis, cell junction and neurogenesis. Moreover, the results of this study were compared with previous studies on goat or other species, and some gene expression patterns shared in early-puberty mammals were discovered. Conclusions The postnatal development of the testis undergoes a process of transition from organ growth to spermatogenesis. During this process, spermatogenesis-related genes are upregulated, whereas neurogenesis-, angiogenesis-, cell junction-, muscle- and immune-related genes are downregulated. In conclusion, the multipathway synergy promotes testicular transition from growth to spermatogenesis in early-puberty goats and may be a common rule shared by mammals.

TI Corporate Perceptions of Climate Science: The Role of Corporate
   Environmental Scientists
SO BUSINESS & SOCIETY
AB Although there has been some growing recognition of the role of private actors in international environmental regimes, little attention has been paid to the role of the private sector at the science-policy interface. Because the automobile industry plays a crucial role in mitigation of greenhouse gases, successful policy requires not just the assent but the active cooperation of this sector. Such cooperation, however, requires some institutional acceptance that climate change is indeed a significant risk. In this article, the authors look at the early stages of the automobile industry's engagement with the discourse on climate change. The authors focus, in particular, on the role of corporate scientists in two U.S. automobile companies in translating this discourse. Acting as boundary spanners and institutional entrepreneurs, these individuals influenced both corporate perceptions of and responses to climate change science.

TI Potential genetic therapies based on m6A methylation for skin
   regeneration: Wound healing and scars/keloids
SO FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Skin wound healing is a complex and multistage process, where any abnormalities at any stage can result in the accumulation of non-functional fibrotic tissue, leading to the formation of skin scars. Epigenetic modifications play a crucial role in regulating gene expression, inhibiting cell fate determination, and responding to environmental stimuli. m6A methylation is the most common post-transcriptional modification of eukaryotic mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs. However, it remains unclear how RNA methylation controls cell fate in different physiological environments. This review aims to discuss the current understanding of the regulatory pathways of RNA methylation in skin wound healing and their therapeutic implications with a focus on the specific mechanisms involved.

TI Events and Collusions A Glossary for the Microethnography of Video Game
   Play
SO GAMES AND CULTURE
AB This essay draws on a number of recent research projects that record and analyze video game play. The "microethnographic'' approach that they develop suggests methodological strategies, both for analyzing gameplay and for identifying and conceptualizing relationships between technology, agency, and aesthetics in everyday technoculture across and between the virtual and the actual. It suggests a new model of technoculture in everyday life, shifting analytical and critical attention away from established research objects and notions (the "impact'' of technologies, consumption, identities and subjectivity, interactivity) and toward the "event'' of gameplay as one with nonhuman as well as human participants, and brought into being by relationships, and translations, of human and nonhuman agency.

TI Inside 'Inside View': reflections on stimulating debate and engagement
   through a multimedia live theatre production on the dilemmas and issues
   of pre-natal screening policy and practice
SO HEALTH EXPECTATIONS
AB Background
   The role of applied theatre in engaging both lay and professional publics with debate on health policy and practice is an emergent field. This paper discusses the development, production performance and discussion of 'Inside View'.1
   Objectives
   The objectives were to produce applied theatre from research findings of a completed study on genetic prenatal screening, exploring the dilemmas for women and health professionals of prenatal genetic screening, and to engage audiences in debate and reflection on the dilemmas of prenatal genetic screening.
   Methods
   'Inside View' was developed from a multidisciplinary research study through identification of emergent themes from qualitative interviews, and development of these by the writer, theatre producer and media technologist with input from the researchers.
   Findings
   Inside View was performed in London and the Midlands to varied audiences with a panel discussion and evaluation post performance. The audiences were engaged in debate that was relevant to them professionally and personally. Knowledge translation through applied theatre is an effective tool for engaging the public but the impact subsequently is unclear. There are ethical issues of unexpected disclosure during discussion post performance and the process of transforming research findings into applied theatre requires time and trust within the multidisciplinary team as well as adequate resourcing.

TI The Theoretical Framework of the Clinical Pilates Exercise Method in
   Managing Non-Specific Chronic Low Back Pain: A Narrative Review
SO BIOLOGY-BASEL
AB Simple Summary Exercise is important in helping people with chronic low back pain to regain wellness. General exercises such as cycling and strength training helps with the condition but require a longer time to achieve meaningful improvements in pain and function. Movement preference is potentially useful in exercise and can help an individual to achieve improvements faster. The Clinical Pilates exercise method uses movement preference and thus is a hybrid of two of the best exercise techniques in managing chronic low back pain. However, current studies in Clinical Pilates are lacking and thus challenge the translation of the technique into clinical practice. Hence, a narrative review of the theory of the Clinical Pilates exercise method is examined, and current literature is reviewed to provide a guide towards successful exercise prescription. A structured approach to physical assessment of human movement is proposed to guide clinicians or researchers involved in exercise prescription to design effective exercises. The structured assessment approach also helps with managing clinical cases with multiple episodes of injuries. Despite limited evidence, the Clinical Pilates exercise method is safe and provides faster and earlier recovery and the same longer term outcomes as general exercises. Exercise plays an important role in rehabilitating people with chronic low back pain. Aerobic exercise and resistance training are general exercise strategies to manage chronic low back pain, but these strategies require longer intervention period to achieve clinical outcomes in pain reduction and functional improvements. Directional preference is recognised as an important exercise strategy in managing low back pain. The Clinical Pilates exercise method leverages on the directional preference of an individual to achieve clinical outcomes faster. Clinical Pilates is a hybrid of two of the best exercise interventions for low back pain, which are general Pilates and the McKenzie method. Due to the scarcity of Clinical Pilates literature, a review of its theory and studies was undertaken to provide a structured guide to the technique in managing people with chronic low back pain. Hypothetical algorithms are developed to support translation into clinical practice and future research studies. These algorithms are useful in the management of complex cases involving multiple directional trauma. Although limited, current evidence suggests that the Clinical Pilates exercise method is safe and provides faster functional recovery in the early stage of rehabilitation and similar longer term outcomes as general exercises.

TI Global histone H3 lysine 27 triple methylation levels are reduced in
   vessels with advanced atherosclerotic plaques
SO LIFE SCIENCES
AB Aims: Alterations in epigenetic processes are frequently noted in human disease. These epigenetic processes involve methylation of DNA and post-translational modifications of histones. It is well established that in particular histone methylation plays a key role in gene transcription. In this study, we have investigated the relationship between triple methylation of lysine 27 in histone H3 (H3K27Me3) modifications and atherosclerotic plaque stage.
   Materials and methods: 28 pen-renal aortic tissue patches covering the entire spectrum of atherosclerotic plaque development were evaluated by immunohistochemistry for the levels of H3K27Me3, EZH2, JMJD3 and BMI1.
   Key findings: The results of our studies are in support of a reduction in global levels of the H3K27Me3 modification in vessels with advanced atherosclerotic plaques. This reduction in H3K27Me3 levels is not accompanied by alterations in global levels of the corresponding histone methyltransferase EZH2, the catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Likewise no alterations in global levels of BMI1 a component of the PRC1 complex, which binds to H3K27Me3-modified histones or the global expression levels of the histone demethylase JMJD3, which removes the methyl marks on H3K27, were observed.
   Significance: Together, our data show that in atherosclerosis development alterations in global levels of H3K27Me3 occur. The reduction in the number of nuclei in the tunica media that display the repressive H3K27Me3 mark in vessels with advanced atherosclerosis plaques therefore could be a reflection of the dynamic pattern of smooth muscle cell differentiation and proliferation associated with atherosclerotic disease.

TI CircRNA: An emerging star in the progression of glioma
SO BIOMEDICINE & PHARMACOTHERAPY
AB Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a class of single-stranded noncoding RNAs with a covalently closed loop structure, are recognized as promising biomarkers and targets for diagnosing and treating dozens of diseases, especially cancers. CircRNAs are extremely stable, abundant and conserved and have tissue- or developmental stage-specific expression. Currently, the biogenesis and biological functions of circRNAs have been increasingly revealed with deep sequencing and bioinformatics. Studies have indicated that circRNAs are frequently expressed in brain tissues and that their expression levels change in different stages of neural development, suggesting that circRNAs may play an important role in diseases of the nervous system, such as glioma. However, because the biogenesis and functions of circRNAs do not depend on a single mechanism but are coregulated by multiple factors, it is necessary to further explore the underlying mechanisms. In this review, we summarized the classification, mechanisms of biogenesis and biological functions of circRNAs. Meanwhile, we emphatically expounded on the process of abnormal expression of circRNAs, methods used in circRNA research, and their effects on the malignant biological capabilities of glioma.

TI Chronic Intermittent Ethanol Exposure Induces Upregulation of Matrix
   Metalloproteinase-9 in the Rat Medial Prefrontal Cortex and Hippocampus
SO NEUROCHEMICAL RESEARCH
AB Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9, Gelatinase B), an extracellular-acting Zn2+-dependent endopeptidase, are involved in brain pathologies including ischemia, glioma, and epilepsy. Recent studies suggested that MMP-9 plays an important role in neuronal plasticity, specifically in learning and memory. To determine whether and how MMP-9 plays role in alcohol-related behaviors, male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were subjected to chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure for 4weeks, following which we collected tissue samples from the hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and amygdala at different stages (acute and chronic exposure) during alcohol exposure. Real-time PCR and western blot assays were used to detect changes in the mRNA and protein expression of MMP-9. Our results indicated that both acute and chronic alcohol exposure induced up-regulation of MMP-9 mRNA levels in the hippocampus and mPFC, but not in the amygdala. Furthermore, acute and chronic alcohol exposure up regulated the expression of total MMP-9 and active MMP-9 in these two brain regions. Moreover, the increase of active MMP-9 expression was larger than those in total MMP-9 expression. Immunoprecipitation analyses identified potential MMP-9-interacting proteins, including Itgb1, Src, Eef1a2, tubulin, actin, and histone H2B. These results demonstrate that both acute and CIE exposure induced increases in MMP-9 expression in the mPFC and hippocampus, suggesting that MMP-9 plays a key role in chronic alcohol exposure and dependence.

TI Lin28 gene and mammalian puberty
SO MOLECULAR REPRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Lin28a and Lin28b, homologs of the Caenorhabditis elegans Lin28 gene, play important roles in cell pluripotency, reprogramming, and tumorigenicity. Recently, genome-wide association and transgenic studies showed that Lin28a and/or Lin28b gene were involved in the onset of mammalian puberty, the stage representing the attainment of reproduction capacity; however, the detailed mechanism of these genes in mammalian puberty remains largely unknown. The present paper reviews the research progress on the roles of Lin28a/b genes in the onset of mammalian puberty by analyzing the results coming from gene expression patterns, mutations, and transgenic studies, and put forward possible pathways for further studies on their roles in animal reproduction.

TI Proteomic Analysis Points to a Role for RAD23 in Apical Dominance in
   Pinus sylvestris var. Mongolica
SO PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTER
AB In higher plants, apical dominance is the phenomenon whereby the main central stem is dominant over other side stems. In the present study, the natural loss of apical dominance in a Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica mutant was characterized. The mutant lacked an obvious trunk, but exhibited a large number of side stems, short internodes and leaves, and dwarfism. Cell biological analyses indicated that the meristem was changed dramatically in the mutant, with irregular cell arrangements, and no obvious layers of meristem and mature tissue. The loss of apical dominance in the mutant plant was accompanied by a significant decrease in auxin (A) and cytokinin (C) content compared to wild type, and increased C/A values. Proteomic analysis of the apical buds using 2DE-ESI-MS/MS at different stages of development (including dormancy, bud break, 10 days after bud break, and 15 days after bud break) revealed 49 proteins that were significantly changed in abundance compared to wild type. These proteins were involved in stress response, energy production and conversion, post-translation modification and amino acid transport and metabolism, as well as many other complex biological processes. Among the identified proteins, Rad23, an abscisic acid- and stress-induced protein, and cytoplasmic aconitate hydratase likely participate in ABA responses, Fe2+ ion homeostasis and the ubiquitin/26S proteasome pathway to regulate apical dominance of buds. Rad23, in particular, appears likely to play an important role in the complicated mechanism of apical dominance of Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica. This work provides important insights into this process as well as forming a basis for the further study of plant apical dominance.

TI Gene expression changes in the salivary glands of Anopheles coluzzii
   elicited by Plasmodium berghei infection
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB Background: Malaria is a devastating infectious disease caused by Plasmodium parasites transmitted through the bites of infected Anopheles mosquitoes. Salivary glands are the only mosquito tissue invaded by Plasmodium sporozoites, being a key stage for the effective parasite transmission, making the study of Anopheles sialome highly relevant.
   Methods: RNA-sequencing was used to compare differential gene expression in salivary glands of uninfected and Plasmodium berghei-infected Anopheles coluzzii mosquitoes. RNA-seq results were validated by quantitative RT-PCR. The transmembrane glucose transporter gene AGAP007752 was selected for functional analysis by RNA interference. The effect of gene silencing on infection level was evaluated. The putative function and tertiary structure of the protein was assessed.
   Results: RNA-seq data showed that 2588 genes were differentially expressed in mosquitoes salivary glands in response to P. berghei infection, being 1578 upregulated and 1010 downregulated. Metabolism, Immunity, Replication/Transcription/Translation, Proteolysis and Transport were the mosquito gene functional classes more affected by parasite infection. Endopeptidase coding genes were the most abundant within the differentially expressed genes in infected salivary glands (P < 0.001). Based on its putative function and expression level, the transmembrane glucose transporter gene, AGAP007752, was selected for functional analysis by RNA interference. The results demonstrated that the number of sporozoites was 44.3 % lower in mosquitoes fed on infected mice after AGAPP007752 gene knockdown when compared to control (P < 0.01).
   Conclusions: Our hypothesis is that the protein encoded by the gene AGAPP007752 may play a role on An. coluzzii salivary glands infection by Plasmodium parasite, working as a sporozoite receptor and/or promoting a favorable environment for the capacity of sporozoites.

TI Monodehydroascorbate reductase gene, regulated by the wheat PN-2013
   miRNA, contributes to adult wheat plant resistance to stripe rust
   through ROS metabolism
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-GENE REGULATORY MECHANISMS
AB Wheat stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is one of the most destructive wheat diseases worldwide. Varieties with adult plant resistance (APR) maintain effective and durable disease resistance. APR to stripe rust in wheat cultivar XZ9104 (XZ) is associated with extensive hypersensitive cell death and production of reactive oxygen species in the host. MDHAR is an important gene in the AsA-GSH cycle, and it plays an important role in maintaining the reduced pool of AsA scavenging hydrogen peroxide. microRNAs (miRNAs) were shown to engage in post-transcriptional regulation by degrading target mRNAs or repressing gene translation in plants responding to abiotic/biotic stresses. Previously, two novel miRNAs (1136-P3 and PN-2013) were isolated in wheat and the target gene of them was determined using degradome sequencing technology. In this study, the target gene was isolated and characterized as TaMDHAR, a monodehydroascorbate reductase gene. We first demonstrated that the target gene could be cleaved by these two miRNAs in tobacco leaves experimentally. However, TaMDHAR was regulated by PN-2013, not 1136-P3, in wheat-Pst adult incompatible interaction according to the expression patterns. The TaMDHAR knockdown resulted in improved wheat resistance to Pst at the seedling stage, with no influence on 1136-P3 and PN-2013 expression. The TaMDHAR knockdown resulted in a much greater H2O2 accumulation and lower APX and CAT activities together with higher expression in several PR genes. We deduced that TaMDHAR could contribute to the APR of XZ through ROS metabolism as regulated by the AsA-GSH cycle. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The possible effect of microRNA-155 (miR-155) and BACE1 inhibitors in
   the memory of patients with down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease:
   Design, synthesis, virtual screening, molecular modeling and biological
   evaluations
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE & DYNAMICS
AB MiR-155 plays main roles in several physiological and pathological mechanisms, such as Down syndrome (DS), immunity and inflammation and potential anti-AD therapeutic target. The miR-155 is one of the overexpressed miRNAs in DS patients that contribute directly and indirectly to the onset or progression of the DS. Since the miR-155 can simultaneously reduce the translation of several genes at post-transcriptional levels, targeting the miR-155 might set the stage for the treatment of DS. One of the rational strategies in providing therapeutic interventions in this respect is to design and develop novel small molecules inhibiting the miR-155 function or biogenesis or maturation. In the present study, we aim to introduce small molecule compounds with the potential to inhibit the generation of the selectively miR-155 processing by employing computational drug design approaches, as well as in vitro studies. We designed and synthesized a novel series of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines derivatives as new nonpeptic candidates for the treatment of DS with AD. The designed compounds were investigated for their BACE1 and miR-155 binder inhibitory potential in vitro and in cell. In addition, we present a systematic computational approach that includes 3 D modeling, docking-based virtual screening, and molecular dynamics simulation to identify Small - molecule inhibitors of pre-miR-155 maturation. To confirm the inhibitory potential of compound 8k on miR-155 maturation, qRT- PCR was performed. All our results confirm that compound 8k, in addition to being a good inhibitor of BACE1, can also be a good inhibitor of miR-155.

TI Studies of the retinal microcirculation using human donor eyes and
   high-resolution clinical imaging: Insights gained to guide future
   research in diabetic retinopathy
SO PROGRESS IN RETINAL AND EYE RESEARCH
AB The microcirculation plays a key role in delivering oxygen to and removing metabolic wastes from energyintensive retinal neurons. Microvascular changes are a hallmark feature of diabetic retinopathy (DR), a major cause of irreversible vision loss globally. Early investigators have performed landmark studies characterising the pathologic manifestations of DR. Previous works have collectively informed us of the clinical stages of DR and the retinal manifestations associated with devastating vision loss. Since these reports, major advancements in histologic techniques coupled with three-dimensional image processing has facilitated a deeper understanding of the structural characteristics in the healthy and diseased retinal circulation. Furthermore, breakthroughs in highresolution retinal imaging have facilitated clinical translation of histologic knowledge to detect and monitor progression of microcirculatory disturbances with greater precision. Isolated perfusion techniques have been applied to human donor eyes to further our understanding of the cytoarchitectural characteristics of the normal human retinal circulation as well as provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of DR. Histology has been used to validate emerging in vivo retinal imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography angiography. This report provides an overview of our research on the human retinal microcirculation in the context of the current ophthalmic literature. We commence by proposing a standardised histologic lexicon for characterising the human retinal microcirculation and subsequently discuss the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying key manifestations of DR, with a focus on microaneurysms and retinal ischaemia. The advantages and limitations of current retinal imaging modalities as determined using histologic validation are also presented. We conclude with an overview of the implications of our research and provide a perspective on future directions in DR research.

TI Evaluating the Effectiveness and Efficiency of Climate Information
   Communication in the African Agricultural Sector: A Systematic Analysis
   of Climate Services
SO AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB The use of climate services (CS) for the provisioning of climate information for informed decision-making on adaptation action has gained momentum. However, a comprehensive review of the literature to evaluate the lessons and experiences of CS implementation in the African agriculture sector is still lacking. Here, we present a systematic review (mapping) of 50 pieces of literature documenting lessons and experiences of CS adoption in the agriculture sector of 20 African countries. The qualitative analysis of the reviewed literature revealed: (1) CS implementation overwhelmingly relied on a participatory process through workshops and participatory scenario planning meetings to connect users with actors along the CS value chain of forecast production, translation, integration, and application. Additionally, innovations such as mobile phones and internet service are increasingly being integrated with CS to strengthen the relationship between CS providers and users. They are, however, mostly at the trial stage and tend to have a varying impact depending on available facilities and infrastructure in the community. (2) Although there is a growing recognition of the need for the integration of indigenous and scientific knowledge systems in the production of climate information, such integration is currently not happening. Rather, indigenous knowledge holders are engaged in a participatory process for insight on modalities of making scientific climate information locally relevant and acceptable. Given the aforementioned findings, we recommend further research on modalities for facilitating indigenous knowledge mainstreaming in climate information production, and investigation of options for using innovations (e.g., mobile) to enhance the interactions between CS users and CS providers. Such research will play a great role in scaling up the adoption of CS in the African agricultural sector.

TI Clinical Studies of Cell Therapy in Cardiovascular Medicine Recent
   Developments and Future Directions
SO CIRCULATION RESEARCH
AB Given the rising prevalence of cardiovascular disease worldwide and the limited therapeutic options for severe heart failure, novel technologies that harness the regenerative capacity of the heart are sorely needed. The therapeutic use of stem cells has the potential to reverse myocardial injury and improve cardiac function, in contrast to most current medical therapies that only mitigate heart failure symptoms. Nearly 2 decades and >200 trials for cardiovascular disease have revealed that most cell types are safe; however, their efficacy remains controversial, limiting the transition of this therapy from investigation to practice. Lessons learned from these initial studies are driving the design of new clinical trials; higher fidelity of cell isolation techniques, standardization of conditions, more consistent use of state of the art measurement techniques, and assessment of multiple end points to garner insights into the efficacy of stem cells. Translation to clinical trials has almost outpaced our mechanistic understanding, and individual patient factors likely play a large role in stem cell efficacy. Therefore, careful analysis of dosing, delivery methods, and the ideal patient populations is necessary to translate cell therapy from research to practice. We are at a pivotal stage in the field in which information from many relatively small clinical trials must guide carefully executed efficacy trials. Larger efficacy trials are being launched to answer questions about older, first-generation stem cell therapeutics, while novel, second-generation products are being introduced into the clinical realm. This review critically examines the current state of clinical research on cell-based therapies for cardiovascular disease, highlighting the controversies in the field, improvements in clinical trial design, and the application of exciting new cell products.

TI Suppression of RBFox2 by Multiple MiRNAs in Pressure Overload-Induced
   Heart Failure
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB Heart failure is the final stage of various cardiovascular diseases and seriously threatens human health. Increasing mediators have been found to be involved in the pathogenesis of heart failure, including the RNA binding protein RBFox2. It participates in multiple aspects of the regulation of cardiac function and plays a critical role in the process of heart failure. However, how RBFox2 itself is regulated remains unclear. Here, we dissected transcriptomic signatures, including mRNAs and miRNAs, in a mouse model of heart failure after TAC surgery. A global analysis showed that an asymmetric alternation in gene expression and a large-scale upregulation of miRNAs occurred in heart failure. An association analysis revealed that the latter not only contributed to the degradation of numerous mRNA transcripts, but also suppressed the translation of key proteins such as RBFox2. With the aid of Ago2 CLIP-seq data, luciferase assays verified that RBFox2 was targeted by multiple miRNAs, including Let-7, miR-16, and miR-200b, which were significantly upregulated in heart failure. The overexpression of these miRNAs suppressed the RBFox2 protein and its downstream effects in cardiomyocytes, which was evidenced by the suppressed alternative splicing of the Enah gene and impaired E-C coupling via the repression of the Jph2 protein. The inhibition of Let-7, the most abundant miRNA family targeting RBFox2, could restore the RBFox2 protein as well as its downstream effects in dysfunctional cardiomyocytes induced by ISO treatment. In all, these findings revealed the molecular mechanism leading to RBFox2 depression in heart failure, and provided an approach to rescue RBFox2 through miRNA inhibition for the treatment of heart failure.

TI Moonwalking in Beijing: Michael Jackson, piliwu, and the origins of
   Chinese hip-hop
SO INTER-ASIA CULTURAL STUDIES
AB During the latter half of the 1980s, a popular dance craze known as "piliwu" swept urban communities across China. A Chinese translation of the U.S. media term "breakdancing," piliwu incorporated what were then two new styles of U.S. urban popular dance-New York-based b-boying/b-girling or breaking (characterized by inversions and dance battles) and California-based popping and locking (characterized by the robot and the moonwalk). Appearing in parks, on nightclub stages, and in popular films, piliwu was China's first localized movement of hip-hop culture, preceding the introduction of rap music by more than a decade. Like other aspects of popular culture in 1980s China, piliwu reflected new circuits of intercultural exchange between China and the United States during the first decade of China's Reform Era. In particular, it demonstrated the impact of U.S. popular music, embodied by stars such as Michael Jackson, and the mediating role that Hong Kong played in introducing these new cultural forms to the lives of Chinese youth. This article follows the career of Tao Jin, China's first hip-hop dance star, and analyzes piliwu dance choreography recorded in Tao's debut film, the 1988 Chinese dance film Rock Youth. Reading this film alongside media reports and testimonials from members of China's piliwu generation, the article reconstructs the history of the piliwu movement. It argues for the central influence of U.S. pop culture icon Michael Jackson, the growth of China's underground commercial dance "zouxue" ("moonlighting") economy, and the agency of dancers' bodies in transnational movements of media culture.

TI Proteome and lysine acetylome analysis reveals insights into the
   molecular mechanism of seed germination in wheat
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Seed germination is the first stage in wheat growth and development, directly affecting grain yield and quality. As an important post-translation modification, lysine acetylation participates in diverse biological functions. However, little is known regarding the quantitative acetylproteome characterization during wheat seed germination. In this study, we generated the first comparative proteomes and lysine acetylomes during wheat seed germination. In total, 5,639 proteins and 1,301 acetylated sites on 722 proteins were identified at 0, 12 and 24 h after imbibitions. Several particularly preferred amino acids were found near acetylation sites, including (KS)-S-ac, (KT)-T-ac, (KK)-K-ac, (KR)-R-ac, (KH)-H-ac, (KF)-F-ac, (KN)-N-ac, K-ac*E, FKac and K-ac*D, in the embryos during seed germination. Among them, (KH)-H-ac, (KF)-F-ac, FKac and (KK)-K-ac were conserved in wheat. Biosynthetic process, transcriptional regulation, ribosome and proteasome pathway related proteins were significantly enriched in both differentially expressed proteins and differentially acetylated proteins through Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis. We also revealed that histone acetylation was differentially involved in epigenetic regulation during seed germination. Meanwhile, abscisic acid and stress related proteins were found with acetylation changes. In addition, we focused on 8 enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, and found they were differentially acetylated during seed germination. Finally, a putative metabolic pathway was proposed to dissect the roles of protein acetylation during wheat seed germination. These results not only demonstrate that lysine acetylation may play key roles in seed germination of wheat but also reveal insights into the molecular mechanism of seed germination in this crop.

TI Cyclin O Regulates Germinal Vesicle Breakdown in Mouse Oocytes
SO BIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION
AB It is well accepted that oocyte meiotic resumption is mainly regulated by the maturation-promoting factor (MPF), which is composed of cyclin B1 (CCNB1) and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDC2). Maturation-promoting factor activity is regulated by the expression level of CCNB1, phosphorylation of CDC2, and their germinal vesicle (GV) localization. In addition to CCNB1, cyclin O (CCNO) is highly expressed in oocytes, but its biological functions are still not clear. By employing short interfering RNA microinjection of GV-stage oocytes, we found that Ccno knockdown inhibited CDC2 (Tyr15) dephosphorylation and arrested oocytes at the GV stage. To rescue meiotic resumption, cell division cycle 25 B kinase (Cdc25b) and Ccnb1 were overexpressed in the Ccno knockdown oocytes. Unexpectedly, we found that Ccno knockdown did not affect CDC25B entry into the GV, and overexpression of CDC25B was not able to rescue resumption of oocyte meiosis. However, GV breakdown (GVBD) was significantly increased after overexpression of Ccnb1 in Ccno knockdown oocytes, indicating that GVBD block caused by cyclin O knockdown can be rescued by cyclin B1 overexpression. We thus conclude that cyclin O, as an upstream regulator of MPF, plays an important role in oocyte meiotic resumption in mouse oocytes.

TI MCP-1 impacts RCT by repressing ABCA1, ABCG1, and SR-BI through PI3K/Akt
   posttranslational regulation in HepG2 cells
SO JOURNAL OF LIPID RESEARCH
AB Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) plays crucial roles at multiple stages of atherosclerosis. We hypothesized that MCP-1 might impair the reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) capacity of HepG2 cells by decreasing the cell-surface protein expression of ATP binding cassette A1 (ABCA1), ATP binding cassette G1 (ABCG1), and scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI). MCP-1 reduced the total protein and mRNA levels of ABCA1 and SR-BI, but not of ABCG1. MCP-1 decreased the cell-surface protein expression of ABCA1, ABCG1, and SR-BI in dose-dependent and time-dependent manners, as measured using cell-surface biotinylation. We further studied the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/serine/threonine protein kinase Akt pathway in regulating receptor trafficking. Both the translation and transcription of ABCA1, ABCG1, and SR-BI were not found to be regulated by the PI3K/Akt pathway. However, the cell-surface protein expression of ABCA1, ABCG1, and SR-BI could be regulated by PI3K activity, and PI3K activation corrected the MCP-1-induced decreases in the cell-surface protein expression of ABCA1, ABCG1, and SR-BI. Moreover, we found that MCP-1 decreased the lipid uptake by HepG2 cells and the ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux to apoA-I, which could be reversed by PI3K activation. Our data suggest that MCP-1 impairs RCT activity in HepG2 cells by a PI3K/Akt-mediated posttranslational regulation of ABCA1, ABCG1, and SR-BI cell-surface expression.-Huang, C-X., Y-L. Zhang, J-F.

TI YB-1 gene expression is kept constant during myocyte differentiation
   through replacement of different transcription factors and then falls
   gradually under the control of neural activity
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY & CELL BIOLOGY
AB We have previously reported that translation of acetylcholine receptor alpha-subunit (AChR alpha) mRNA in skeletal muscle cells is regulated by Y-box binding protein 1 (YB-1) in response to neural activity, and that in the postnatal mouse developmental changes in the amount of YB-1 mRNA are similar to those of AChR a mRNA, which is known to be regulated by myogenic transcription factors. Here, we examined transcriptional regulation of the YB-1 gene in mouse skeletal muscle and differentiating C2C12 myocytes. Although neither YB-1 nor AChR alpha was detected at either the mRNA or protein level in adult hind limb muscle, YB-1 expression was transiently activated in response to denervation of the sciatic nerve and completely paralleled that of AChR a, suggesting that these genes are regulated by the same transcription factors. However, during differentiation of C2C12 cells to myotubes, the level of YB-1 remained constant even though the level of AChR a increased markedly. Reporter gene, gel mobility shift and ChIP assays revealed that in the initial stage of myocyte differentiation, transcription of the YB-1 gene was regulated by E2F1 and Spl, and was then gradually replaced under the control of both MyoD and myogenin through an E-box sequence in the proximal region of the YB-1 gene promoter. These results suggest that transcription factors for the YB-1 gene are exchanged during skeletal muscle cell differentiation, perhaps playing a role in translational control of mRNAs by YB-1 in both myotube formation and the response of skeletal muscle tissues to neural stimulation.

   of gambogic acid in human breast carcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF NATURAL MEDICINES
AB Gambogic acid (GA) is an anticancer agent in phase IIb clinical trial in China but its mechanism of action has not been fully clarified. The present study was designed to search the possible target-related proteins of GA in cancer cells using proteomic method and establish possible network using bioinformatic analysis. Cytotoxicity and anti-migration effects of GA in MDA-MB-231 cells were checked using MTT assay, flow cytometry, wound migration assay, and chamber migration assay. Possible target-related proteins of GA at early (3 h) and late stage (24 h) of treatment were searched using a proteomic technology, two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). The possible network of GA was established using bioinformatic analysis. The intracellular expression levels of vimentin, keratin 18, and calumenin were determined using Western blotting. GA inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. Additionally, GA exhibited anti-migration effects at non-toxic doses. In 2-DE analysis, totally 23 possible GA targeted proteins were found, including those with functions in cytoskeleton and transport, regulation of redox state, metabolism, ubiquitin-proteasome system, transcription and translation, protein transport and modification, and cytokine. Network analysis of these proteins suggested that cytoskeleton-related proteins might play important roles in the effects of GA. Results of Western blotting confirmed the cleavage of vimentin, increase in keratin 18, and decrease in calumenin levels in GA-treated cells. In summary, GA is a multi-target compound and its anti-cancer effects may be based on several target-related proteins such as cytoskeleton-related proteins.

TI Alternaria brown spot on new clones of sweet orange and lemon in Italy
SO PHYTOPATHOLOGIA MEDITERRANEA
AB Since 2013 an Alternaria disease has been observed in Italy on new clones of sweet orange and lemon, during pre-harvest stages. Isolations were made from diseased leaves and fruit collected from these hosts and from other known Alternaria hosts (Citrus x clementina, Citrus reticulata 'Mandalate' and Citrus sinensis 'Valencia'). The typical small-conidium Alternaria species was consistently isolated from symptomatic tissues. One hundred and sixty-two Alternaria isolates were recovered from 15 citrus orchards in Catania, Syracuse and Palermo provinces, and 148 of these were used for multigene phylogenetic analyses based on the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (EF-1 alpha) genes. Most of the characterized isolates (97.3%) belonged to the A. alternata Glade, and the remainder were A. arborescens. Pathogenicity tests of 49 isolates of A. alternata and one of A. arborescens were performed on young detached leaves and on detached immature fruit of orange, lemon, calamondin, and rangpur lime. Toxicity of culture filtrates of representative isolates on detached leaves was also evaluated. In addition, pathogenicity tests were carried out on immature fruit in planta under controlled environment conditions. Most of the isolates (72%, including A. alternata and A. arborescens) were pathogenic on all inoculated citrus species and caused brown spot symptoms identical to those induced on tangerine. This study demonstrates the ability of A. alternata to cause damage in the field on new and popular clones of sweet orange and lemon. The hypothesis is supported that secondary metabolites, in addition to the ACT-toxin or ACR-toxin, could play roles in Alternaria spp. pathogenicity to citrus hosts.

TI Protein adsorption phenomena in hemodialysis membranes: Mechanisms,
   influences of clinical practices, modeling, and challenges
SO COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Kidney failure affects a significant part of the world's population where more than 2 million people currently undergoing some sort of treatment for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). One of the most common treatments is hemodialysis (HD) which consists of an extracorporeal membrane-based therapy that can retain toxins and remove excess fluid. However, patients can experience short- and long-term life-threatening complications associated with protein adsorption to the HD membrane. Upon contact between blood and membrane, protein adsorption takes place incautiously promoting the build-up of a cake layer and activation of complex reactions called biochemical cascades. The mechanisms of protein adsorption can be complex due to the highly heterogeneous composition of blood and are still not fully understood. Membrane properties such as biocompatibility and surface roughness play a critical role in protein adsorption since it influences the affinity between membrane material and blood components. Also, the HD operating conditions in the clinical practices can significantly influence protein adsorption and play a critical role in the cell rupture pathway which can enhance the adsorption process. Modeling and predicting membrane fouling and protein adsorption in HD have a great potential to guide the definition of adequate operating conditions for HD treatment but still limited. Predictive models can indicate how to manipulate blood and dialysate flow rate, operating pressure, and treatment time to yield better control of protein adsorption, reducing the side effects that are linked to unacceptably high morbidity and mortality rates. This critical review will focus on a comprehensive understanding of the protein adsorption phenomenon, including its mechanisms, its influential factors, and the blood activations and the consequences associated with this phenomenon. Also, and current models and challenges for predicting protein adsorption and membrane fouling are reviewed. Moreover, this review will cover how there is a distinct lack of knowledge when it comes to currently hypothesized mechanistic aspects and their translation into mathematical concepts and models to predict protein adsorption and hemodialysis membrane performance. The models seen so far lack in describing multiprotein adsorption as a function of hemodialysis operating conditions and correlation with patient outcomes.

TI The nuclear GUCT domain-containing DEAD-box RNA helicases govern
   gametophytic and sporophytic development in Physcomitrium patens
SO PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB Key message In Physcomitrium patens, PpRH1/PpRH2 are GUCT-domain-containing DEAD-BOX RNA helicases localize to the nucleus. They are implicated in cell and tissue development in all stages of the moss life cycle.
   The DEAD-box-containing RNA helicase family encompasses a large and functionally important group of enzymes involved in cellular processes committed to the metabolism of RNA, including its transcription, processing, transport, translation and decay. Studies indicate this protein family has implied roles in plant vegetative and reproductive developmental processes as well as response to environmental stresses such has cold and high salinity. We focus here on a small conserved sub-group of GUCT domain-containing RNA helicase in the moss Physcomitrium patens. Phylogenetic analysis shows that RNA helicases containing the GUCT domain form a distinct conserved clade across the green lineage. In this clade, the P. patens genome possesses two closely related paralogues RNA helicases predicted to be nuclear, PpRH1 and PpRH2. Using in-locus gene fluorescent tagging we show that PpRH1 is localized to the nucleus in protonema. Analysis of PpRH1 and PpRH2 deletions, individually and together, indicates their potential roles in protonema, gametophore and sporophyte cellular and tissue development in P. patens. Additionally, the ultrastructural analysis of phyllid chloroplasts in Delta rh2 and Delta rh1/2 shows distinct starch granule accumulation under standard growth conditions associated with changes in photosynthetic activity parameters. We could not detect effects of either temperature or stress on protonema growth or PpRH1 and PpRH2 expression. Together, these results suggest that nuclear GUCT-containing RNA helicases play a role primarily in developmental processes directly or indirectly linked to photosynthesis activity in the moss P. patens.

TI Overexpression of p-4EBP1 associates with p-eIF4E and predicts poor
   prognosis for non-small cell lung cancer patients with resection
SO PLOS ONE
AB Eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and its phosphorylated form (p-eIF4E) play a crucial role in the protein synthesis, both are under regulation of eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-interacting kinases (MNKs). This study aims to explore the potential prognostic significance of p-4EBP1 and p-eIF4E in NSCLC patients. The expression of p-4EBP1 and p-eIF4E in NSCLC patients was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining in tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing 354 NSCLC and 53 non-cancerous lung tissues (Non-CLT). The overexpression percentage of p-4EBP1 and p-eIF4E in lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (ADC) was significantly higher than that of Non-CLT. P-4EBP1 expression in patients with advanced clinical stage was higher than that in early stage. Expression of p-4EBP1 had a positive relationship with p-eIF4E expression both in lung SCC and ADC. NSCLC patients with high expression of p-4EBP1 and p-eIF4E alone or in combination had a lower survival rate than that of other phenotypes. For NSCLC patients, p-4EBP1 is an independent poor prognostic factor as well as clinical stage, LNM and pathological grade. Overexpression of p-4EBP1 and p-eIF4E might be novel prognostic marker for NSCLC, who possesses potential application value for NSCLC targeted therapy.

TI Reshaping the role of m6A modification in cancer transcriptome: a review
SO CANCER CELL INTERNATIONAL
AB N6-methyl-adenosine(m6A) modification emerges as an abundant and dynamic regulation throughout the Eukaryotic transcriptome. Dysregulation of the m6A regulators has increasingly been found in many neoplasms. It is reasonable to believe that m6A changes the fate of cancer cells and subsequently affected all aspects of cancer progression. In view of the context-dependent role of m6A modification, we emphasize a dual effect of m6A in a particular tumor model, that is, m6A plays a promoting role or a suppressing role in different stages of cancer. This novel sight is compared to the older view that a particular m6A regulator acts as a consistent role in cancer progression.

TI Introduction: The Field of Ramlila
SO ASIAN THEATRE JOURNAL
AB This special issue is intended to briefly introduce the field of Ramlila, as a performance practice and as an idea. It is designed to give a taste of its geographic range and a sample of its multiple and diverse manifestations in India and the Indian diaspora. The Introduction briefly discusses the literary sources of Ramlila, its history, chief styles, and emerging trends. It also includes a synopsis of the story of Ram in Ramlila. Following this, a translation of three scenes from the Lav-Kush Ramlila in Old Delhi, with a critical introduction, sheds light on the mounting politicization of Ramlila by the Hindu Right. Two articles, one on Nautanki and one on Ramayan Gaan, illustrate that Ramlila is a form of theatre very much in dialogue with other forms of popular performance in the Hindi belt and along its linguistic borders, narratively, aesthetically, and ideologically. A review-essay of two documentaries and an interview with an expert on Kumaoni Ramlila further demonstrate the diversity of Ramayan-themed performance, despite the continued homogenization and commercialization of Ramlila. An article on a distinctive Ramlila in Trinidad and another in the United States (North Carolina) speak to the global reach of Ramlila, and its important role in "homemaking." Finally, a report on a festival to commemorate a Ramayan-themed dance drama (wayang wong) at Prambanan recalls the Ramayan's early journey from South to Southeast Asia.
   Pamela Lothspeich is Associate Professor of South Asian Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Her research spans the Hindu epics, modern Indian literature, performance studies, and postcolonial studies. She is the author of Epic Nation: Reimagining the Mahabharata in the Age of Empire (Oxford University Press, 2009). She has been researching Ramlila since 2006, and has observed performances in the state of Uttar Pradesh over seven Ramlila cycles (2006, 2010-2013, 2017, and 2019). She is currently a fellow at the National Humanities Center and completing a book on the Radheshyam Ramayan and the neighborhood Ramlila.

TI Judith as Spiritual Warrior: Female Models of Monastic Masculinity in ae
   lfric's Judith and Byrhtferth's Enchiridion
SO ENGLISH STUDIES
AB This article identifies a passage in Byrhtferth's Enchiridion as referencing monastic discussions of Judith based on Aldhelm's Carmen de virginitate and Prudentius's Psychomachia. In this passage, Byrhtferth imagines himself as Judith leading an army of virgins against the forces of lechery. The context of Byrhtferth's identification with Judith has many resonances with ae lfric's translation of Judith, which ae lfric explains allegorically as spiritual warfare in the epilogue to the homily. The article suggests that one audience of ae lfric's Judith would have been monks, who may have identified with her leading the army of virginity just as Byrhtferth did. By associating monasticism with Judith, as a virago, fighting in an invisible battle against spiritual adversaries, Byrhtferth, ae lfric, and their fellow monks are able to reclaim masculinity lost by their proscription from battle during the Viking invasion of the late tenth and early eleventh-century.

TI Advances in engineering and delivery strategies for cytokine
   immunotherapy
SO EXPERT OPINION ON DRUG DELIVERY
AB IntroductionCytokine immunotherapy is a growing field for the treatment of cancer, infectious disease, autoimmunity, and other ailments. Therapeutic cytokines are a class of secreted, small proteins that play a pivotal role in regulating the innate and adaptive immune system by provoking or mitigating immune responses. In the clinic, cytokines are frequently combined with other treatments, such as small molecules and monoclonal antibodies. However, the clinical translation of cytokine therapies is hindered by their short half-life, pleiotropic nature, and off-target effects, which cause diminished efficacy and severe systemic toxicity. Such toxicity limits dosage, thus resulting in suboptimal doses. Accordingly, numerous efforts have been devoted to exploring strategies to promote cytokine therapies by improving their tissue specificity and pharmacokinetics.Areas coveredPreclinical and clinical research into bioengineering and delivery strategies for cytokines, consisting of bioconjugation, fusion proteins, nanoparticles, and scaffold-based systems.Expert opinionThese approaches pave the way for the development of next-generation cytokine treatments with greater clinical benefit and reduced toxicity, circumventing such issues currently associated with cytokine therapy.

TI Complementary transcriptomic and proteomic analyses reveal the cellular
   and molecular processes that drive growth and development of Fasciola
   hepatica in the host liver
SO BMC GENOMICS
AB Background: The major pathogenesis associated with Fasciola hepatica infection results from the extensive tissue damage caused by the tunnelling and feeding activity of immature flukes during their migration, growth and development in the liver. This is compounded by the pathology caused by host innate and adaptive immune responses that struggle to simultaneously counter infection and repair tissue damage.
   Results: Complementary transcriptomic and proteomic approaches defined the F. hepatica factors associated with their migration in the liver, and the resulting immune-pathogenesis. Immature liver-stage flukes express similar to 8000 transcripts that are enriched for transcription and translation processes reflective of intensive protein production and signal transduction pathways. Key pathways that regulate neoblast/pluripotent cells, including the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway, are particularly dominant and emphasise the importance of neoblast-like cells for the parasite's rapid development. The liver-stage parasites display different secretome profiles, reflecting their distinct niche within the host, and supports the view that cathepsin peptidases, cathepsin peptidase inhibitors, saposins and leucine aminopeptidases play a central role in the parasite's destructive migration, and digestion of host tissue and blood. Immature flukes are also primed for countering immune attack by secreting immunomodulating fatty acid binding proteins (FABP) and helminth defence molecules (FhHDM). Combined with published host microarray data, our results suggest that considerable immune cell infiltration and subsequent fibrosis of the liver tissue exacerbates oxidative stress within parenchyma that compels the expression of a range of antioxidant molecules within both host and parasite.
   Conclusions: The migration of immature F. hepatica parasites within the liver is associated with an increase in protein production, expression of signalling pathways and neoblast proliferation that drive their rapid growth and development. The secretion of a defined set of molecules, particularly cathepsin L peptidases, peptidase-inhibitors, saponins, immune-regulators and antioxidants allow the parasite to negotiate the liver micro-environment, immune attack and increasing levels of oxidative stress. This data contributes to the growing F. hepatica -omics information that can be exploited to understand parasite development more fully and for the design of novel control strategies to prevent host liver tissue destruction and pathology.

An example of this is material citation, which can provide society with links to both the past and connections to contemporary features. In this article, we look at the diverging ways of relating to and reinventing the past in the Viking Age, exploring citations to ancient monuments in the landscape of Gammel Lejre on Zealand, Denmark. Complementing the placement of landscape monuments, attention is also brought to examples of mortuary citations related to bodily practices in Viking-age mortuary dramas, such as those visible at the mound of Skopintull on the island of Adelso in Lake Malaren, Sweden. Through these case studies, we explore the variability in citational strategies found across tenth-century Scandinavia.

TI Cross-Cultural Differences in the Acceptance of Barnum Profiles
   Supposedly Derived From Western Versus Chinese Astrology
SO JOURNAL OF CROSS-CULTURAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB The present study examines cross-cultural differences in the Barnum effect. At Stage 1 of the study, 287 respondents (comprising 149 Westerners and 138 Chinese nationals) provided birth details and completed a belief-in-astrology questionnaire. At Stage 2 a week later, 258 of these (130 Westerners, 128 Chinese) then completed a second belief-in-astrology questionnaire before receiving a Barnum profile supposedly derived from either Western or Chinese astrology, which they rated for, among other things, perceived accuracy (a) for themselves and (b) for other people in general. Preliminary analysis offered initial support for a universal Barnum effect. However, this disappeared after respondent gender, age, general education, and psychological knowledge were controlled for. Further analyses revealed little support for cross-cultural differences in either astrological beliefs or susceptibility to the Barnum effect, although surprisingly, Chinese nationals who believed in astrology did perceive their own (Barnum) profile to be more accurate for people in general than did Chinese skeptics. Finally, Barnum acceptance was not influenced by the apparent source of profiles. The role these factors play in relation to Barnum susceptibility and methodological limitations of the present study are discussed.

TI mTORC1 activity is essential for erythropoiesis and B cell lineage
   commitment
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that mediates phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signalling. This pathway is involved in a plethora of cellular functions including protein and lipid synthesis, cell migration, cell proliferation and apoptosis. In this study, we proposed to delineate the role of mTORC1 in haemopoietic lineage commitment using knock out (KO) mouse and cell line models. Mx1-cre and Vav-cre expression systems were used to specifically target Raptor(fl/fl) (mTORC1), either in all tissues upon poly(I:C) inoculation, or specifically in haemopoietic stem cells, respectively. Assessment of the role of mTORC1 during the early stages of development in Vav-cre(+)Raptor(fl/fl) mice, revealed that these mice do not survive post birth due to aberrations in erythropoiesis resulting from an arrest in development at the megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitor stage. Furthermore, Raptor-deficient mice exhibited a block in B cell lineage commitment. The essential role of Raptor (mTORC1) in erythrocyte and B lineage commitment was confirmed in adult Mx1-cre(+)Raptor(fl/fl) mice upon cre-recombinase induction. These studies were supported by results showing that the expression of key lineage commitment regulators, GATA1, GATA2 and PAX5 were dysregulated in the absence of mTORC1-mediated signals. The regulatory role of mTOR during erythropoiesis was confirmed in vitro by demonstrating a reduction of K562 cell differentiation towards RBCs in the presence of established mTOR inhibitors. While mTORC1 plays a fundamental role in promoting RBC development, we showed that mTORC2 has an opposing role, as Rictor-deficient progenitor cells exhibited an elevation in RBC colony formation ex vivo. Collectively, our data demonstrate a critical role played by mTORC1 in regulating the haemopoietic cell lineage commitment.

AB Circular RNAs (circRNA) represent a distinct class of covalently closed-loop RNA molecules, which play diverse roles in regulating biological processes and disease states. The enhanced stability of synthetic circRNAs compared to their linear counterparts has recently garnered considerable research interest, pav -ing the way for new therapeutic applications. While clinical circRNA technology is still in its early stages, significant advancements in mRNA technology offer valuable insights into its potential future applica-tions. Two primary obstacles that must be addressed are the development of efficient production meth-ods and the optimization of delivery systems. To expedite progress in this area, this review aims to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge on circRNA structure and function, outline recent techniques for synthesizing circRNAs, highlight key delivery strategies and applications, and discuss the current challenges and future prospects in the field of circRNA-based therapeutics.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI Techno-economic analysis (TEA) of microbial oil production from waste
   resources as part of a biorefinery concept: assessment at multiple
   scales under uncertainty
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Background Microbial oils - often termed single cell oils (SCOs) - offer an alternative to terrestrial oil crops across the energy, food and chemical industries. In addition to oils, a range of secondary metabolites can be produced from the heterotrophic organisms as part of a biorefinery system. Techno-economic analysis (TEA) is an important tool for evaluating economic viability, and although TEA is subject to high uncertainties where production is still at the laboratory scale, the tool can play a significant role in directing further research to evaluate suitability of scale-up. Results SCO production from the oleaginous yeast Metschnikowia pulcherrima using sucrose, wheat straw and distillery waste feedstocks was evaluated at two production scales. At a scale of 100 t year(-1) oil production a minimum estimated selling price (MESP) of euro14 000 t(-1) was determined for sucrose. This reduced to euro4-8000 t(-1) on scaling to 10 000 t year(-1), with sucrose and wheat straw yielding the lowest MESP. Conclusions Feedstock price and lipid yield had the greatest impact on overall economic return, though the valorization of co-products also had a large effect, and further play between feedstock and system productivity strategies could bring the price down to be competitive with terrestrial oils in the future. The novel approach demonstrated here for the first time integrates uncertainty into economic analysis whilst facilitating decision-support at an early technology development stage.

TI Staufen1, Kinesin1 and microtubule function in cyclin B1 mRNA transport
   to the animal polar cytoplasm of zebrafish oocytes
SO BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
AB In zebrafish oocytes, cyclin B1 mRNAs are transported to the animal polar cytoplasm. To elucidate the molecular basis of cyclin B1 mRNA transport, we analyzed zebrafish Staufen1, a protein known to play a central role in mRNA transport to the vegetal pole of Xenopus oocytes. Zebrafish Staufen1 interacts with cyclin B1 mRNA throughout oocyte growth. Both cyclin B1 mRNA and Staufen1 are evenly distributed in the cytoplasm of young oocytes but are co-localized to the animal polar cytoplasm in later stages. Real-time imaging showed that the plus ends of oocyte microtubules are free in the cytoplasm in early stages but anchored to the animal polar cytoplasm in later stages. Transport of cyclin B1 reporter mRNA to the animal polar cytoplasm was inhibited by disruption of microtubules and injection of antibodies against Staufen1 or Kinesin1, a plus-end-directed microtubule motor that interacts with Staufen1, indicating that the transport depends on movement along microtubules toward the plus ends. Reporter mRNAs with an element required for the vegetal localization of vg1 mRNA in Xenopus oocytes were localized to the animal polar cytoplasm in zebrafish oocytes, indicating that the element is functional for animal polar localization in zebrafish oocytes. Our findings suggest that cyclin B1 mRNA-Staufen1 protein complexes are transported toward the animal pole of zebrafish oocytes by the plus-end-directed motor protein Kinesin1 along microtubules and that a common mRNA transport machinery functions in zebrafish and Xenopus oocytes, although its transport direction is opposite due to different organizations of microtubules.

TI Representations of violence in Slaghuis (2007) and Skrapnel (2011) by
   playwright Willem Anker
SO TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE
AB Representations of violence in Slaghuis (2007) and Skrapnel (2011) by playwright Willem Anker The article aims at establishing whether and how the conceptual metaphors violence is literary revenge and violence is global terrorism realise in two published plays by Willem Anker. This aim raises critical questions concerning the nature of the violence depicted in Slaghuis (meaning butchery, 2007) and in Skrapnel (meaning shrapnel, 2011). An additional critical question is whether representations of violence are unique to Anker's plays, i.e. whether representing specific forms of violence are also present in other Afrikaans plays from the decade during which plays by Anker were staged.
   Similar to Pirandello's play, Six Characters in Search of an Author (1922), the characters in Slaghuis (2007) display an ambivalent nature. The explanation for the ambivalence is that the characters originate from books by Afrikaans novelist Etienne Leroux. Leroux is also a character in the play. Each character in Slaghuis (2007) experiences similar forms of violence and trauma as is the case in the novel from which the playwright took them. The characters demand that the character Leroux complete their stories and thereby end their fictional existence. Leroux turns down their demands. In an act of literary revenge, they then brutally murder their fictional author in a fictional onstage butchery. In an ironic twist of fate, all (including the fictional author Leroux) realise that they are bound to the person that created them, namely the characters to the novelist Leroux, and the character Leroux to the playwright Anker.
   Similar to Slaghuis (2007) the representation of violence in Skrapnel (2011) relates to pages taken from other sources, in this case from the internet. Skrapnel (2011) consequently confirms the statement by Brink (2010) that representations of violence in the period are unique "in the way of narrating as such, that is, in the presentation of that content" (original emphasis). The influence of web pages on the plot is critical in the sense that the playwright translated large portions of selected web pages into Afrikaans and included his translations in the text. These web pages contain descriptions of international events marked by extreme violence. Because the events occurred abroad, we may regard the violence depicted in Skrapnel (2011) as examples of global or international violence. The characters touched by the violence, however, are South Africans. Based on real events, the violence represented in the play is of an extreme nature, namely the representation of a terrorist attack on the London Underground in 2005, and the description in the dialogue of two aircraft that deliberately flew into two tall buildings in 2001. The representations of the attacks on the London Underground in 2005 and the attack on the Twin Towers in New York in 2001 provide the backdrop for the relationship between the characters Chris and X Their relationship develops and terminates in violence characterised by nihilism.
   The discussion therefore confirms that the conceptual metaphors violence is literary revenge and violence is global terrorism are active in the published plays. For instance, the representation of extreme violence in the two plays shows similarities with the depiction of extreme violence in some British plays, specifically Crave (2001) by Sarah Kane, which was performed for the first time during the last decade of the previous millennium. Anker translated Crave (2001) into Afrikaans as Smag (2008), which suggests that he is familiar with Kane's plays. These similarities primarily relate to the representation of excessive physical (bloody murder of the author in Slaghuis, warlike attacks on civilian targets in Skrapnel) and excessive psychological violence or nihilism in Skrapnel.
   Representations of extreme forms of violence are not unique to Anker's plays during the decade that his plays were performed for the first time. Prinsloo versus (2009) by Adriaan Meyer and Die kortstondige raldewe van Anastacia W ([nd], meaning the brief shelf life of Anastacia W) by Marlene van Niekerk also demonstrate extremities of violence. Together with Slaghuis (2007) and Skrapnel (2011), Prinsloo versus (2009) and Die kortstondige raklewe van Anastacia Wind] serve as examples of plays in Afrikaans confirming statements that Brink (2010) made in a Marjorie Wallace/Jan Rabie Memorial Lecture. Brink (2010) then said that "a trail of blood stains our literature". According to Brink (2010), what is new are expressions of "a violence that customarily went further and became more atrocious than even brute colonialism made possible or necessary within every context".

TI mTOR/P70S6K promotes spermatogonia proliferation and spermatogenesis in
   Sprague Dawley rats
SO REPRODUCTIVE BIOMEDICINE ONLINE
AB Spermatogenesis is a critical process for maintaining male fertility. Sustained spermatogonial stem cell self-renewal and differentiation ensures constant spermatogenesis, and several signalling pathways regulate this process. An increasing number of studies have suggested that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway plays an important role in spermatogenesis; however, the mechanism remains unknown. Our study showed that mTOR was positively related with spermatogenesis by detecting mTOR expression and the expression of its target p70s6k, rps6 and 4e-bp1 at different developmental stages. Phosphorylated p70s6k, rps6 and 4ebp1 levels were independently and gradually down-regulated with age. Subsequently, we showed in vivo and in vitro that, upon mTOR inactivation by rapamycin, the number of sperm significantly decreased (P < 0.05) and spermatogonia proliferation was blocked. Phosphorylated p70s6k and rps6 levels were down-regulated, but the levels of phosphorylated 4e-bp1 did not change. Spermatogonia were treated with the specific PI3K inhibitor LY294002, and p70s6k, rps6 and 4ebp1 phosphorylation overtly decreased. Therefore, we suggest that mTOR plays an important role in spermatogenesis by regulating p70s6k activation and that 4e-bp1 is either directly or indirectly regulated by PI3K.

TI Extracellular Vesicles as Drug Delivery Systems in Organ
   Transplantation: The Next Frontier
SO PHARMACEUTICS
AB Extracellular vesicles are lipid bilayer-delimited nanoparticles excreted into the extracellular space by all cells. They carry a cargo rich in proteins, lipids and DNA, as well as a full complement of RNA species, which they deliver to recipient cells to induce downstream signalling, and they play a key role in many physiological and pathological processes. There is evidence that native and hybrid EVs may be used as effective drug delivery systems, with their intrinsic ability to protect and deliver a functional cargo by utilising endogenous cellular mechanisms making them attractive as therapeutics. Organ transplantation is the gold standard for treatment for suitable patients with end-stage organ failure. However, significant challenges still remain in organ transplantation; prevention of graft rejection requires heavy immunosuppression and the lack of donor organs results in a failure to meet demand, as manifested by growing waiting lists. Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated the ability of EVs to prevent rejection in transplantation and mitigate ischemia reperfusion injury in several disease models. The findings of this work have made clinical translation of EVs possible, with several clinical trials actively recruiting patients. However, there is much to be uncovered, and it is essential to understand the mechanisms behind the therapeutic benefits of EVs. Machine perfusion of isolated organs provides an unparalleled platform for the investigation of EV biology and the testing of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of EVs. This review classifies EVs and their biogenesis routes, and discusses the isolation and characterisation methods adopted by the international EV research community, before delving into what is known about EVs as drug delivery systems and why organ transplantation represents an ideal platform for their development as drug delivery systems.

TI Grzegorz Wisniewski's Production of Richard III in Teatr Jaracza in
   Lodz-Textual Authority, the "Director's Cut", and Theatre Status
SO MULTICULTURAL SHAKESPEARE-TRANSLATION APPROPRIATION AND PERFORMANCE
AB Grzegorz Wisniewski's 2012 Richard III in Teatr Jaracza in Lodz was a very successful production with critics and audiences alike. At the 2012 Gdansk Shakespeare Festival it won the Golden Yorick, a prestigious Polish award for the best staging of a Shakespearean play in the season. Wisniewski, a renown Polish theatre director and professor at the National Film School in Lodz, has his own way of understanding theatre, its role in culture, and Shakespeare's place in it. Wisniewski believes in the theatre of the middle path, as he calls it, that is neither classical/conservative, nor radically avant-garde. He wants to attract wide audiences and offer them intellectual and well-balanced cultural entertainment. Without diminishing the weight of such cultural and literary icons as Shakespeare, he vivisects texts to make productions that can easily speak to a contemporary audience. This paper analyzes Wisniewski's Richard III to show how the director manages to achieve balance between his own auteur power, the authority and complexity of Shakespeare's text, and theatre's cultural mission.

TI Combining Hyperpolarized Real-Time Metabolic Imaging and NMR
   Spectroscopy To Identify Metabolic Biomarkers in Pancreatic Cancer
SO JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH
AB Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a 120 deadly cancer that progresses without any symptom, and oftentimes, it is detected at an advanced stage. The lack of prior symptoms and effective treatments have created a knowledge gap in the management of this lethal disease. This issue can be addressed by developing novel noninvasive imaging-based biomarkers in PDAC. We explored in vivo hyperpolarized (HP)C- 13 MRS of pyruvate to lactate conversion and ex vivo H-1 NMR spectroscopy in a panel of well-annotated patient-derived PDAC xenograft (PDXs) model and investigated the correlation between aberrant glycolytic metabolism and aggressiveness of the tumor. Real-time metabolic imaging data demonstrate the immediate intracellular conversion of HP C-13 pyruvate to lactate after intravenous injection interrogating upregulated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in aggressive PDXs. Total ex vivo lactate measurement by H-1 NMR spectroscopy showed a direct correlation with in vivo dynamic pyruvateto-lactate conversion and demonstrated the potential of dynamic metabolic flux as a biomarker of total lactate concentration and aggressiveness of the tumor. Furthermore, the metabolite concentrations were very distinct among all four tumor types analyzed in this study. Overexpression of LDH-A and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1 alpha) plays a significant role in the conversion kinetics of HP pyruvate-to-lactate in tumors. Collectively, these data identified aberrant metabolic characteristics of pancreatic cancer PDXs and could potentially delineate metabolic targets for therapeutic intervention. Metabolic imaging with HP pyruvate and NMR metabolomics may enable identification and classification of aggressive subtypes of patient-derived xenografts. Translation of this real-time metabolic technique to the clinic may have the potential to improve the management of patients at high risk of developing pancreatic diseases.

TI Targeting Non-coding RNA in Vascular Biology and Disease
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY
AB Only recently have we begun to appreciate the importance and complexity of the non-coding genome, owing in some part to truly significant advances in genomic technology such as RNA sequencing and genome-wide profiling studies. Previously thought to be non-functional transcriptional "noise," non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are now known to play important roles in many diverse biological pathways, not least in vascular disease. While microRNAs (miRNA) are known to regulate protein-coding gene expression principally through mRNA degradation, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can activate and repress genes by a variety of mechanisms at both transcriptional and translational levels. These versatile molecules, with complex secondary structures, may interact with chromatin, proteins, and other RNA to form complexes with an array of functional consequences. A body of emerging evidence indicates that both classes of ncRNAs regulate multiple physiological and pathological processes in vascular physiology and disease. While dozens of miRNAs are now implicated and described in relative mechanistic depth, relatively fewer lncRNAs are well described. However, notable examples include ANRIL, SMILR, and SENCR in vascular smooth muscle cells; MALAT1 and GATA-6S in endothelial cells; and mitochondrial lncRNA LIPCAR as a powerful biomarker. Due to such ubiquitous involvement in pathology and well-known biogenesis and functional genetics, novel miRNA-based therapies and delivery methods are now in development, including some early stage clinical trials. Although lncRNAs may hold similar potential, much more needs to be understood about their relatively complex molecular behaviours before realistic translation into novel therapies. Here, we review the current understanding of the mechanism and function of ncRNA, focusing on miRNAs and lncRNAs in vascular disease and atherosclerosis. We discuss existing therapies and current delivery methods, emphasising the importance of miRNAs and lncRNAs as effectors and biomarkers in vascular pathology.

TI MicroRNA-183 promotes migration and invasion of CD133(+)/CD326(+) lung
   adenocarcinoma initiating cells via PTPN4 inhibition
SO TUMOR BIOLOGY
AB Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common cancer worldwide and is a leading cause of lung cancer mortality due to early stage metastases. Cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) or tumor-initiating cells (TICs) are rare subpopulation cells that are responsible for maintaining tumor growth and invasion leading to recurrence and metastasis. Previous studies revealed that miR-183 can mediate the invasiveness and growth of NSCLC. However, the exact role of miR-183 in regulating the biological behavior of CSLCs in NSCLC remains unclear. In the present study, we explored the regulation of protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 4 (PTPN4) by miR-183 in vitro using luciferase reporter assays, and we further analyzed the effects of miR-183 on the invasiveness of CSLCs in vitro and in vivo using transwell and bioluminescence assays. Following our finding that miR-183 binds to PTPN4 messenger RNA (mRNA) to prevent its translation through the 3'-untranslated region (UTR), we found that overexpression of miR-183 in CSLCs decreased PTPN4 protein levels while inhibition of miR-183 increased PTPN4 protein levels. The suppression of PTPN4 levels in CSLCs by miR-183 paralleled with a significant promotion in their motility in vitro and in vivo, while anti-sense miR-183 increased PTPN4 levels in CSLCs, which paralleled with a significant decrease in their invasiveness. Furthermore, correlation analysis between miR-183 and PTPN4 in clinical samples demonstrated a statistically significant inverse correlation between PTPN4 mRNA levels and miR-183. In brief, our data indicate that miR-183 plays a pro-invasive role by inverse regulation of PTPN4, and this axis may be a new therapeutic target for suppressing the metastatic capability of CSLCs in NSCLC.

TI MicroRNA-133a alleviates airway remodeling in asthtama through
   PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway by targeting IGF1R
SO JOURNAL OF CELLULAR PHYSIOLOGY
AB Asthma is characterized by chronic inflammation, and long-term chronic inflammation leads to airway remodeling. But the potential regulatory mechanism of airway remodeling is not clearly understood, and there is still no effective way to prevent airway remodeling. Present studies have confirmed the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the development of disease, which is known as suppressing translation or degradation of messenger RNA (mRNA) at the posttranscriptional stage. In this study, we described the role of miRNA-133a in asthma and demonstrated it in regulating airway remodeling of asthma through the phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway by targeting IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R). IGF1R helps in mediating the intracellular signaling cascades. Asthmatic mice models were established by sensitization and Ovalbumin challenge. Adenovirus transfer vector carrying miR-133a or miR-133a sponge sequence was used to build the overexpression or downexpression of miR-133a modeling. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot were used to determine the alterations in the expression of miR-133a and mRNAs and their corresponding proteins. Results showed that miR-133a was downregulated in asthma. Upregulation of miR-133a expression in airway smooth muscle cells in vivo and in vitro could inhibit the activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, and reduce the expression of -smooth muscle actin (-SMA), indicating that airway remodeling was inhibited. Functional studies based on luciferase reporter revealed miR-133a as a direct target of IGF1R mRNA. In conclusion, these data suggested that miR-133a regulated the expression of -SMA through PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling by targeting IGF1R. miR-133a plays a key role in airway remodeling of asthma and may serve as a potential therapeutic target for managing asthmatic airway remodeling.

TI The expression level of CSDAP1 in lung cancer and its clinical
   significance
SO ONCOLOGY LETTERS
AB Expression level of messenger RNA (mRNA) of cold shock domain protein A intronless pseudogene (CSDAP1) in lung cancer tissues was studied. Fresh pathological specimens collected from 317 patients with primary lung cancer through surgical resection from January 2007 to January 2012 were selected. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot analysis were used to detect the transcription and translation of CSDAP1 in lung cancer tissues and cancer-adjacent normal tissues, and the results were analyzed in combination with clinicopathological features and prognosis of lung cancer. Among 317 lung cancer specimens, 105 cases (33.1%) had high expression of CSDAP1. Among 138 cases of pulmonary adenocarcinoma, 59 cases had high expression of CSDAP1, and the high expression rate was 42.8%. Among 170 cases of lung squamous cell carcinoma, 46 cases had high expression of CSDAP1, and the high expression rate was 27.5% (P<0.05). Three cases of large cell carcinoma and 9 cases of small cell carcinoma had extremely low expression or had no expression of CSDAP1. Among the 127 lung cancer patients with regional lymph node metastasis, 53 cases (41.7%) had high expression of CSDAP1, while among the 190 lung cancer patients without regional lymph node metastasis, 52 cases (27.4%) had high expression of CSDAP1 (P<0.05). The results also revealed that the expression of CSDAP1 was also related to tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging of lung cancer. One-year, three-year and five-year survival rates of lung cancer patients who had no expression of CSDAP1 were relatively high (P<0.05). The results suggested that CSDAP1 may play an important role in the occurrence, development and judgement of prognosis of lung cancer.

TI Solifluction-induced modifications of archaeological levels: simulation
   based on experimental data from a modern periglacial slope and
   application to French Palaeolithic sites
SO JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE
AB The taphonomic study of Petit-Bost, Croix-de-Canard and Cantalouette II, three Palaeolithic sites that were recently discovered near Perigueux and Bergerac (Dordogne, France) in a colluvial context, has enlightened the difficulty of adequately appreciating the relative role of cultural and natural processes in site spatial patterning. Periglacial solifluction was thought to have played a significant role in site formation. Because the nature of the modifications induced by solifluction was still poorly understood, a simulation was made using data of soil movement recorded at La Mortice (French Southern Alps, 3100 m in elevation) in a modern periglacial environment. The results show that, for a knapping location, the first steps of deformation are typified both by a downslope translation of the location center and by an anisotropic diffusion of the artifacts. The knapping spot becomes elongated along the slope, with a dense relic concentration of artifacts in the upslope portion. This type of pattern has been obtained after 100-200 years of simulated displacement according to the climatic and soil conditions that characterise the La Mortice site. The ultimate stages of deformation show that the artifact distribution tends to homogenise on larger surfaces and resemble a random distribution. The ability of the simulated patterns to closely fit those observed in archaeological contexts is evaluated at three sites from Southwestern France. At Petit-Bost, the hypothesis of limited solifluction explains accurately the association of both cultural (artifact concentrations) and natural (artifact preferred orientation) features. At Croix-de-Canard, long-term solifluction can be proposed. By contrast, the simulated patterns do not describe the structures observed on the steeper slopes at Cantalouette II, where the knapping spot transforms into distinct solifluction lobes.

TI Trajectory Planning With Shortest Path for Modified Uncalibrated Visual
   Servoing Based on Projective Homography
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB In order to improve the robustness and optimize trajectory of projective homography-based uncalibrated visual servoing (PHUVS) proposed in our previous work, an analytical expression of optimal trajectory for camera in projective homography space is proposed in this article, which is totally free of camera parameters and is corresponding to camera's shortest path in the 3-D space with straight path in translation and minimal geodesic in rotation. The projective homography is computed without scale ambiguity in both planning and tracking stages. The PHUVS controller is modified correspondingly to track the planned trajectory in projective homography space while maintaining superior characteristic of PHUVS under uncalibrated scenario. The simulations and experiments' results reveal the effectiveness and necessity of the proposed trajectory optimization method in the existence of large initial errors. Note to Practitioners-The state-of-the-art visual-guided robotic technology in industry usually requires system calibration, which is often costly, vulnerable, and challenging for ordinary workers. In our previous work, we offered an uncalibrated visual servo method based on projective homography named projective homography-based uncalibrated visual servoing (PHUVS), which is suitable for plug and play application for eye-in-hand robot visual servo tasks. However, PHUVS suffers from some defects, including undesirable 3-D space motion and local convergence. In this article, we proposed the trajectory planning method along with a modified PHUVS controller to improve the original one from the disadvantages mentioned earlier. This planning method is also calibration-free. With pure image information, a straight-line path in translational motion along with minimal geodesic in rotary motion can be achieved. This approach is capable of extending the range of applications for uncalibrated visual servo technology in robotic tasks, such as assembling, painting, and robotic machining.

TI PMTED: a plant microRNA target expression database
SO BMC BIOINFORMATICS
AB Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are identified in nearly all plants where they play important roles in development and stress responses by target mRNA cleavage or translation repression. MiRNAs exert their functions by sequence complementation with target genes and hence their targets can be predicted using bioinformatics algorithms. In the past two decades, microarray technology has been employed to study genes involved in important biological processes such as biotic response, abiotic response, and specific tissues and developmental stages, many of which are miRNA targets. Despite their value in assisting research work for plant biologists, miRNA target genes are difficult to access without pre-processing and assistance of necessary analytical and visualization tools because they are embedded in a large body of microarray data that are scattered around in public databases.
   Description: Plant MiRNA Target Expression Database (PMTED) is designed to retrieve and analyze expression profiles of miRNA targets represented in the plethora of existing microarray data that are manually curated. It provides a Basic Information query function for miRNAs and their target sequences, gene ontology, and differential expression profiles. It also provides searching and browsing functions for a global Meta-network among species, bioprocesses, conditions, and miRNAs, meta-terms curated from well annotated microarray experiments. Networks are displayed through a Cytoscape Web-based graphical interface. In addition to conserved miRNAs, PMTED provides a target prediction portal for user-defined novel miRNAs and corresponding target expression profile retrieval. Hypotheses that are suggested by miRNA-target networks should provide starting points for further experimental validation.
   Conclusions: PMTED exploits value-added microarray data to study the contextual significance of miRNA target genes and should assist functional investigation for both miRNAs and their targets. PMTED will be updated over time and is freely available for non-commercial use at http://pmted.agrinome.org.

TI "O HIMMLISCH LICHT!" cinema and the withdrawal of the gods
   (straub-huillet, holderlin, godard, brecht)
SO ANGELAKI-JOURNAL OF THE THEORETICAL HUMANITIES
AB In Godard's Le Mepris [Contempt, 1963], Fritz Lang, playing a fictional version of himself, evokes the complex relationship between cinema's future and the end of cinema by citing a famous verse from the German poet Friedrich Holderlin, according to which what counts in respect of poetry is henceforth no longer the secret persistence of the gods, nor their covert proximity, but their enduring absence. This paper explores the implications of that insight as they come to affect first Godard's film, then the three films based on Holderlin's works directed by Daniele Huillet and Jean-Marie Straub between 1986 and 1992: Der Tod des Empedokles [The Death of Empedocles]; Schwarze SUnde [Black Sin]; and Die Antigone des Sophokles nach der Holderlinschen Ubertragung fUr die BUhne bearbeitet von Brecht (Suhrkamp Verlag, 1948) [Sophocles Antigone Based on Holderlin's Translation, as Adapted for the Stage by Brecht (published by Suhrkamp, 1948)]. At issue in all those films, and similarly in Straub and Huillet's 1974 film of Schoenberg's Moses und Aron, is the tension between the project or dream of sacrifice as a form of fusional politico-religious redemption and its very impossibility as such, attributable (among others) to the necessary subordination of film to spatio-temporal differentiation and, by that token, to what is irreducible to the visible and the invisible alike. Through careful analysis of Huillet and Straub's filmmaking strategy, the paper examines both the aesthetic and political consequences of their interruption of the logic of sacrifice, and seeks to show how the future of cinema is not reducible to the aesthetics of the spectacular but is inseparable from the promise of that which, before or beyond spectacle, has not yet ever been seen before.

TI Preclinical evaluation of [Tc-99m]Tc-labeled anti-EpCAM nanobody for
   EpCAM receptor expression imaging by immuno-SPECT/CT
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
AB Purpose Overexpression of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) plays essential roles in tumorigenesis and tumor progression in almost all epithelium-derived cancer. Monitoring EpCAM expression in tumors can be used for the diagnosis, staging, and prognosis of cancer patients, as well as guiding the individualized treatment of EpCAM-targeted drugs. In this study, we described the synthesis and evaluation of a site-specifically [Tc-99m]Tc-labeled EpCAM-targeted nanobody for the SPECT/CT imaging of EpCAM expression.
   Methods We first prepared the [Tc-99m]Tc-HYNIC-G(4)K; then, it was site-specifically connected to EpCAM-targeted nanobody NB4. The in vitro characteristics of [Tc-99m]Tc-NB4 were investigated in HT-29 (EpCAM positive) and HL-60 (EpCAM negative) cells, while the in vivo studies were performed using small-animal SPECT/CT in the subcutaneous tumor models and the lymph node metastasis model to verify the specific targeting capacity as well as the potential applications of [Tc-99m]Tc-NB4.
   Results [Tc-99m]Tc-NB4 displayed a high EpCAM specificity both in vitro and in vivo. SPECT/CT imaging revealed that [Tc-99m]Tc-NB4 was cleared rapidly from the blood and normal organs except for the kidneys, and HT-29 tumors were clearly visualized in contrast with HL-60 tumors. The uptake value of [Tc-99m]Tc-NB4 in HT-29 tumors was increased continuously from 3.77 +/- 0.39%ID/g at 0.5 h to 5.53 +/- 0.82%ID/g at 12 h after injection. Moreover, the [Tc-99m]Tc-NB4 SPECT/CT could clearly image tumor-draining lymph nodes.
   Conclusion [Tc-99m]Tc-NB4 is a broad-spectrum, specific, and sensitive SPECT radiotracer for the noninvasive imaging of EpCAM expression in the epithelium-derived cancer and revealed a great potential for the clinical translation.

TI Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in Lactoferrin Gene are Associated with
   Lactoferrin Content in Milk and Somatic Cell Count in Deoni (Bos
   indicus) Cows
SO PAKISTAN VETERINARY JOURNAL
AB Lactoferrin, a glycoprotein, is an important antimicrobial molecule present in milk which plays a vital role in antimicrobial defence of the udder in bovines. In the present investigation, polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) studies were carried out in 122 Deoni (Bos indicus) cows to detect SNPs of lactoferrin gene and to analyze the association between the observed polymorphisms with milk lactoferrin content and Somatic Cell Count (SCC). The PCR-SSCP analysis revealed a total of 20 different variants in the entire coding regions of the lactoferrin gene. Analysis of exons 2, 6 and 8 of lactoferrin gene revealed 4, 3 and 5 unique SSCP patterns, respectively. The PCR-SSCP analysis of exons 3, 9, 14 and 15 revealed two unique SSCP patterns. Comparison of nucleotide sequences of lactoferrin gene of the Deoni cows with taurine cattle revealed a total of 39 point mutations, 25 of which were found to be in coding region. Conceptualized translation of nucleotide sequence revealed 15 amino acid changes. The SSCP variants of exons 2 and 6 had significant (P<0.05) effect on milk SCC. The SSCP variants of exon 3 and exon 15 showed significant effect on lactoferrin content. The SCC and lactoferrin content in Deoni cows was highest in 4th and above parity group. Somatic Cell Count was lowest in early stage of lactation. Parity was found to have highly significant (P<0.01) effect on both milk SCC and lactoferrin content. The observed association between SSCP variants in lactoferrin gene with milk SCC, and milk lactoferrin content suggests the possibility of using these genetic variants in lactoferrin gene as prognostic markers for selection of animals for high lactoferrin content, low SCC and mastitis resistance.

TI Chi-miR-30b-5p inhibits dermal papilla cells proliferation by
   targetingCaMKII delta gene in cashmere goat
SO BMC GENOMICS
AB Background During goat embryonic morphogenesis and postnatal initiation of hair follicle (HF) regeneration, dermal papilla (DP) cells play a vital role in hair formation. Growing evidence shows that microRNAs (miRNAs) participate in HF development and DP cell proliferation. However, the molecular mechanisms have not been thoroughly investigated. Result In this study, we utilized miRNA sequencing (miRNA-Seq) to identify differentially expressed miRNAs at different HF cycling stages (anagen and telogen). MiRNA-Seq has identified 411 annotated miRNAs and 130 novel miRNAs in which 29 miRNAs were up-regulated and 32 miRNAs were down-regulated in the anagen phase compared to the telogen phase. Target gene prediction and functional enrichment analysis indicated some major biological pathways related to hair cycling, such as Wnt signaling pathways, ECM-receptor interaction, VEGF signaling pathway, biosynthesis of amino acids, metabolic pathways, ribosome and oxidative phosphorylation. Also, we explored the function of chi-miR-30b-5p in regulating hair growth cycle. Similar to the HF cycling, DP cells were isolated from skin and used to investigate miRNA functions. The MTT and EdU assays showed that the viability and proliferation of DP cells were inhibited or promoted after the transfection of chi-miR-30b-5p mimic or inhibitor, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis revealedCaMKII delta as a candidate target gene of chi-miR-30b-5p, and the dual-luciferase and western blot assay demonstrated that chi-miR-30b-5p bound to the 3'UTR ofCaMKII delta and further inhibited its translation. Conclusion Chi-miR-30b-5p was found to be highly expressed in the telogen than that in the anagen phase and could inhibit the proliferation of DP cells by targetingCaMKII delta. Our study provides new information on the regulatory functions of miRNAs during HF development.

TI Effect of machine stiffness on interpreting contact force-indentation
   depth curves in adhesive elastic contact experiments
SO JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS
AB Dry adhesion plays a critical role in many fields, including the locomotion of some insects and failure of microelectromechanical systems. The Dupre's work of adhesion of a contact interface is an important metric of dry adhesion. It is often measured by applying the Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) theory [1] to contact force-indentation depth curves that are measured using an atomic force microscope (AFM), or an instrument modeled after it. The JKR theory has been exceptionally successful in interpreting contact force-indentation depth measurements and explaining adhesive, elastic contact phenomena, such as the pull in and pull-off instabilities. However, in many cases the JKR theory predicts a lower magnitude for the pull-off force than what is experimentally measured, and it does not capture the finite changes in the indentation depth that occur during the pull-in and pull-off instabilities. In those cases, applying the JKR theory to calculate the work of adhesion from only the measured pull-off force is likely to give highly inaccurate results. We believe that these discrepancies occur because the classical JKR theory ignores the machine stiffness which, in the case of AFM-type instruments, is the stiffness of the mechanical structure that connects the tip to the translation stage, which moves the tip towards and away from the substrate. In this paper, we present a model that is related to, but more general than, the JKR theory that accounts for the machine stiffness. This model explains the experimental data better than the JKR theory in the cases where the JKR theory displays the aforementioned discrepancies. We consider both the first order necessary and the higher order sufficiency conditions while deriving the solutions in our model. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Overexpression of kinesin family member 20A is associated with
   unfavorable clinical outcome and tumor progression in epithelial ovarian
   cancer
SO CANCER MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH
AB Background: KIF20A plays an indispensable role in cytokinesis regulation, which is important for tumor proliferation and growth. Recently, the oncogenic role of KIF20A has been well documented in several cancers. However, its clinical role in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) remains not reported yet. We investigated its expression and its role in promoting invasion and chemoresistance in EOC cells.
   Patients and methods: KIF20A transcription and translation levels were investigated in normal ovarian epithelial cell, ovarian cancer cells, and 10 pairs of fresh EOC tissues and adjacent normal ovarian tissues by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blots. Moreover, KIF20A protein level was also examined by immunohistochemistry in 150 EOC tissues. The correlation between KIF20A expression and clinical variables was analyzed by statistical methods. We also used wound healing assay, transwell assay MTT, and Annexin V/PI to explore KIF20A functions.
   Results: KIF20A expression was obviously elevated at both mRNA and protein levels in EOC cell lines and clinical cancer tissues compared with normal ovarian epithelial cell and adjacent normal ovarian tissues. KIF20A protein expression was highly correlated with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage (P=0.008), lymph node metastasis (P=0.002), intraperitoneal metastasis (P<0.001), vital status at last follow-up (P<0.001), intraperitoneal recurrence (P=0.030), tumor recurrence (P=0.005), drug resistance (P=0.013), and ascites with tumor cells (P<0.001). KIF20A overexpression was closely related to poorer overall survival and disease progression-free survival. Furthermore, Cox regression analysis revealed that KIF20A can act as an independent hazard indicator for predicting clinical outcomes in EOC patients. Interestingly, KIF20A overexpression promoted invasion and metastasis of EOC cells and also confers resistance to cisplatin.
   Conclusion: Our findings indicated that KIF20A overexpression predicts unfavorable clinical outcome, revealing that KIF20A holds a promising potential to serve as a useful prognostic biomarker for EOC patients.

TI MicroRNA-873 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis by targeting
   CXCL1 in gastric cancer
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PATHOLOGY
AB MiRNAs can be considered as a proto-oncogene and a tumor suppressor gene by the targeted inhibition of mRNAs translation. More and more studies show that miR-873 can inhibit the growth of tumor. In spite of this, the mechanism by which miR-873 inhibits the development of gastric cancer remains unclear. Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1) is a secreted growth factor that signals through the G-protein coupled receptor. CXCL1 plays a role in inflammation, and aberrant expression of this protein is associated with the growth and progression of certain tumors. In order to explore the relationship between miR-873 and the development of gastric cancer, we analyzed the expression level of miR-873 in 72 cases of gastric cancer, the prognosis and survival rate. What's more, we tested the effect of miR-873 on the proliferation and apoptosis of gastric cancer cells. Through the bioinformatics analysis, the action target of miR-873 was predicted and verified. The results showed that miR-873 was significantly down-regulated in gastric cancer tissue and gastric cancer cell line. Clinical data showed that the low expression of miR-873 was significantly associated with poor prognostic features of GC (including serum alpha fetal protein (AFP) level), tumor size and TNM stage. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies showed that miR-873 can inhibit the proliferation of HGC27 cells and induce apoptosis of HGC27 cells. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the 3' UTR region of CXCL1 mRNA contains the binding site of miR-873. CXCL1 knockdown abrogated the effects of miR-873 deletion on GC cells with decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. Taken together, our results reveal that miR-873 can be used as a tumor suppressor that prevent proliferation and induce apoptosis in GC by targeting CXCL1.

TI Dynamic metabolic profiles of the marine macroalga Ulva prolifera during
   fragmentation-induced proliferation
SO PLOS ONE
AB Ulva prolifera, a type of marine macroalgae, is the causative species behind green tides mainly in the Yellow Sea and adjacent regions. Nevertheless, it can be used as food or animal feed in South China. The vegetative fragments of U. prolifera are an important seed source for successive green tide blooms. Fragmentation shortens the transition time from the vegetative state to the reproductive state. However, the translation of the algal metabolites during gametogenesis is far from well understood. In this study, the dynamic metabolic profiles of U. prolifera thallus during fragmentation-induced proliferation were investigated using non-targeted metabolomics approach via a series of time course experiments in June 2017. After a 30 min low temperature shock, fragmentation induced a reproductive response of 91.57% of U. prolifera in 48 h, whereas the value was only 21.43% in the control group. A total of 156 chromatographic peaks were detected, and 63 metabolites were significantly changed in U. prolifera during reproduction. Aanlysis of the kinetic metabolic pattern showed that the fragments not only induced the formation of sporangia, but also led to complex metabolite accumulation. During fragmentation-induced proliferation, U. prolifera consumed different sugars at different time points gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamic acid, gallic acid, and malic acid may play important roles in germ cell formation and in the release of U. prolifera, whereas n-hexanol, 2-methyl-3-phenylindole, and 3-indoleacetonitrile may be beneficial for biotic stress resistance. Compared with the control group, in the treatment group, metabolites such as alcohols and organic acids also showed significant difference with the photoperiod at the initial stage of proliferation (before 60 h). In conclusion, changes in the levels of metabolites, including sugars, organic acids, and alcohol with photoperiod may be the strategy adopted by U. prolifera to cope with fragmentation in nature.

TI An integrated group FWA-ELECTRE III approach based on interval type-2
   fuzzy sets for solving the MCDM problems using limit distance mean
SO COMPLEX & INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB The material handling equipment (MHE) has a close connection with layout of machinery and plays the important role in productivity of servicing or manufacturing systems. Since each of MHE has distinct characteristics than the others with respect to conflicting criteria and design experts may state the different subjective judgments with respect to qualitative criteria, the material handling equipment selection problem (MHESP) can be taken into account as a group multi-criteria decision-making (GMCDM) problem. In this paper, a version of type-2 fuzzy sets (T2FSs), named Gaussian interval type-2 fuzzy sets (GIT2FSs), is first used as an alternative to the traditional triangular membership functions (MFs) to weight criteria and sub-criteria and also evaluate of alternatives with respect to sub-criteria. The synthetic value method of GIT2FSs is then carried out to convert the assessments stated as GIT2FSs for each alternative with respect to each sub-criterion and also weights of criteria (sub-criteria) into the single fuzzy rating and weight, respectively. Then, the fuzzy weighted average (FWA) approach is adopted to integrate the single fuzzy ratings of each alternative with respect to sub-criteria and the single fuzzy weights of sub-criteria under each criterion with the aggregated weighted ratings. In next stage, ELECTRE III (ELimination Et Choix Traduisant la Realite '-elimination and choice translation reality) is generalized with GIT2FSs to select the optimal MHE through a new ranking approach. Moreover, some arithmetic operations and properties are extended to GIT2FSs. In addition, to demonstrate its potential applications, the proposed methodology is implemented in a real case study and an illustrative example, and then, the ranking results are compared with those of the others in the literature. Finally, the sensitivity analysis is carried out to show robustness and stability of the obtained results.

TI Circular RNAs Repertoire and Expression Profile during Brassica rapa
   Pollen Development
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are covalently closed RNA molecules generated by the back-splicing of exons from linear precursor mRNAs. Though various linear RNAs have been shown to play important regulatory roles in many biological and developmental processes, little is known about the role of their circular counterparts. In this study, we performed high-throughput RNA sequencing to delineate the expression profile and potential function of circRNAs during the five stages of pollen development in Brassica rapa. A total of 1180 circRNAs were detected in pollen development, of which 367 showed stage-specific expression patterns. Functional enrichment and metabolic pathway analysis showed that the parent genes of circRNAs were mainly involved in pollen-related molecular and biological processes such as mitotic and meiotic cell division, DNA processes, protein synthesis, protein modification, and polysaccharide biosynthesis. Moreover, by predicting the circRNA-miRNA network from our differentially expressed circRNAs, we found 88 circRNAs with potential miRNA binding sites, suggesting their role in post-transcriptional regulation of the genes. Finally, we confirmed the back-splicing sites of nine selected circRNAs using divergent primers and Sanger sequencing. Our study presents the systematic analysis of circular RNAs during pollen development and forms the basis of future studies for unlocking complex gene regulatory networks underpinning reproduction in flowering plants.

TI Key circRNAs from goat: discovery, integrated regulatory network and
   their putative roles in the differentiation of intramuscular adipocytes
SO BMC GENOMICS
AB BackgroundThe procession of preadipocytes differentiation into mature adipocytes involves multiple cellular and signal transduction pathways. Recently. a seirces of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), including circular RNAs (circRNAs) were proved to play important roles in regulating differentiation of adipocytes.ResultIn this study, we aimed to identificate the potential circRNAs in the early and late stages of goat intramuscular adipocytes differentiation. Using bioinformatics methods to predict their biological functions and map the circRNA-miRNA interaction network. Over 104 million clean reads in goat intramuscular preadipocytes and adipocytes were mapped, of which16 circRNAs were differentially expressed (DE-circRNAs). Furthermore, we used real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) technology to randomly detect the expression levels of 8 circRNAs among the DE-circRNAs, and our result verifies the accuracy of the RNA-seq data. From the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis of the DE-circRNAs, two circRNAs, circ_0005870 and circ_0000946, were found in Focal adhesion and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Then we draw the circRNA-miRNA interaction network and obtained the miRNAs that possibly interact with circ_0005870 and circ_0000946. Using TargetScan, miRTarBase and miR-TCDS online databases, we further obtained the mRNAs that may interact with the miRNAs, and generated the final circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction network. Combined with the following GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG enrichment analysis, we obtained 5 key mRNAs related to adipocyte differentiation in our interaction network, which are FOXO3(forkhead box O3), PPP2CA (protein phosphatase 2 catalytic subunit alpha), EEIF4E (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4), CDK6 (cyclin dependent kinase 6) and ACVR1 (activin A receptor type 1).ConclusionsBy using Illumina HiSeq and online databases, we generated the final circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction network that have valuable functions in adipocyte differentiation. Our work serves as a valuable genomic resource for in-depth exploration of the molecular mechanism of ncRNAs interaction network regulating adipocyte differentiation.

TI A 15-Gene Immune, Stromal, and Proliferation Gene Signature that
   Significantly Associates with Poor Survival in Patients with Pancreatic
   Ductal Adenocarcinoma
SO CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH
AB Purpose: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal disease with dismal survival rates. Tumor microenvironment (TME), comprising of immune cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts, plays a key role in driving poor prognosis and resistance to chemotherapy. Herein, we aimed to identify a TME-associated, risk-stratification gene biomarker signature in PDAC.
   Experimental Design: The initial biomarker discovery was performed in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, n = 163) transcriptomic data. This was followed by independent validation of the gene signature in the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC, n = 95), E-MTAB-6134 (n = 288), and GSE71729 (n = 123) datasets for predicting overall survival (OS), and for its ability to detect poor molecular subtypes. Clinical validation and nomogram establishment was undertaken by performing multivariate Cox regression analysis.
   Results: Our biomarker discovery effort identified a 15-gene immune, stromal, and proliferation (ISP) gene signature that significantly associated with poor OS [HR, 3.90; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.36-6.41; P < 0.0001]. This signature also robustly predicted survival in three independent validation cohorts ICGC [HR, 2.63 (1.56- 4.41); P < 0.0001], E-MTAB-6134 [HR, 1.53 (1.14-2.04); P = 0.004], and GSE71729 [HR, 2.33 (1.493.63); P < 0.0001]. Interestingly, the ISP signature also permitted identification of poor molecular PDAC subtypes with excellent accuracy in all four cohorts; TCGA (AUC = 0.94), ICGC (AUC = 0.91), E- MTAB-6134 (AUC = 0.80), and GSE71729 (AUC = 0.83). The ISP-derived high-risk patients exhibited significantly poor OS in a clinical validation cohort [n = 119; HR, 2.62 (1.50-4.56); P = 0.0004]. A nomogram was established which included the ISP, CA19-9, and T- and N-stage for eventual clinical translation.
   Conclusions: We report a novel gene signature for riskstratification and robust identification of patients with PDAC with poor molecular subtypes.

TI Microbial Symbionts of Insects: Genetic Organization, Adaptive Role, and
   Evolution
SO MICROBIOLOGY
AB The microorganisms forming symbioses with insects play an important role in nutrition, development and evolution of their hosts. They make it possible for their hosts to use poorly digestible nutrients, to resist the biotic and abiotic stresses, and to regulate the metamorphosis. The microsymbionts of insects may be facultative (genetically specialized for symbiosis but retaining the capacity for autonomous existence; they are usually located extracellularly, in the gut, hemolymph, or salivary glands of the host) or obligatory (incapable of autonomous existence due to the loss of large parts of their genomes; they are usually located inside specialized host cells). The intracellular symbionts (endocytobionts) are capable of vertical transmission during the host reproduction, which determines the loss of many housekeeping genes, including the genes for replication, transcription and translation. In some obligatory symbionts, amplification of genes performing the functions useful for the hosts, such as the synthesis of essential amino acids, was found. These symbionts exhibit increased rates of accumulation of mutations, including non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions, reflecting suppression of the purifying selection and activation of genetic drift stimulating the genome reduction. Transfer of some genes from endocytobionts to the nuclear chromosomes of insects enables them to implement the novel metabolic functions, including assimilation of rare nutrients. The obligatory intracellular insect symbionts may be used as models to reconstruct the early stages of evolution of cellular organelles, which involve reduction of essential genes and the loss of genetic individuality of the symbionts, i.e., the ability for self-maintenance and expression of their residual genomes. Genetic analysis of insect microsymbionts extends the opportunities for their practical application associated with biological control of harmful insects (herbivorous, bloodsucking) and stimulation of the beneficial ones (honey collectors, pollinators, antagonists of pests).

TI miRNAs: New Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets in Dementia
SO CURRENT PHARMACEUTICAL DESIGN
AB Background: Dementia is a complex pathological state that affects millions of individuals worldwide and is responsible for a huge socioeconomic burden, making it a major health concern of current times. Given the impact of dementia in both patients and caregivers, it is crucial to fully clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying dementia-associated disorders, since without this knowledge our ability to correctly diagnose and treat these diseases is severely hampered.
   Methods: Epigenetic mechanisms, such as miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation, have been reported to play a role in dementia pathogenesis. Given their ability to bind complementary mRNA sequences, miRNAs are able to induce temporary or permanent translation repression of their mRNA targets.
   Results: Consequently, changes in miRNA levels may contribute to alterations in the expression of dementia-related proteins, impacting the course of the disease. Conversely, studies have also reported that some of these proteins are able to regulate the biogenesis and transport of miRNAs, hinting at novel disease-related mechanisms that are now beginning to be explored. These findings have made miRNAs both interesting tools and promising targets in the design of novel therapeutic strategies. Moreover, the discovery of circulating miRNAs, which are released by cells of various tissues, including the brain, and travel in membrane-bound vesicles found in most biofluids, opened new possibilities concerning the usefulness of miRNAs as biomarkers of disease.
   Conclusion: In this context, the major aim of this review is to discuss the relevance of these small non-coding RNAs in dementia, focusing on their role as gene expression regulators, their potential as biomarkers of dementia subtype and stage, and the hypothesis of using miRNA modulation as an innovative therapeutic approach to treat dementia-related disorders.

TI A novel gait-based synthesis procedure for the design of 4-bar
   exoskeleton with natural trajectories
SO JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC TRANSLATION
AB Background/Objective: Human walking involves the coordination of brain, nerves, and muscles. A disturbance in their coordination may result in gait disorder. The gait disorder may be treated through manually assisted gait training or with the aid of assistive devices/robotic devices. These robotic devices involve mechanisms which are synthesized using complex conventional procedures. Therefore, in this study, a new gait-based synthesis procedure is proposed, which simplifies the mechanism synthesis and helps to develop a mechanism which can be used in rehabilitation devices, bipeds, etc.
   Methods: This article presents a novel procedure for the synthesis of 4-bar linkage using the natural gait trajectories. As opposed to the conventional synthesis procedures, in this procedure, a global reference frame is considered, which allows the use of hip trajectory while moving. Moreover, this method is divided into two stages, and five precision points are considered on the hip trajectory in each stage. In the first stage, the 4-bar linkage is designed, thereafter, the configurations of the linkage for the remaining precision points are determined in the second stage. The proposed synthesis procedure reduces the complexity involved in the synthesis and helps in the simplification of the problem formulation. A two-stage optimization problem is formulated for minimizing the error between the generated and desired hip trajectories. Two nature-inspired algorithms are used for solving the optimization problem. The obtained best results are presented, and the designed linkage is simulated in MATLAB.
   Results: The best design of the linkage is obtained using particle swarm optimization. The trajectories generated by the designed linkage using the proposed methodology can accurately track the desired path, which indicates that designed linkage can achieve all the orientations required during walking. The positions of a whole lower limb at all the desired precision points are demonstrated by stick diagram for one gait.
   Conclusion: The proposed methodology has reduced the complexity of synthesis procedures and used optimization techniques to obtain a feasible design of the mechanism. The stick diagram of the designed mechanism obtained using the proposed method indicates that the designed mechanism can walk smoothly. Hence, the designed mechanism can be used in the rehabilitation devices. Furthermore, a conceptual design of an exoskeleton knee is also presented.
   The Translational Potential of this Article: Many hospitals and individuals have used the immobile and portable rehabilitation devices. These devices involve mechanisms, and the design of mechanism plays a vital role in the functioning of these devices; therefore, we have developed a new synthesis procedure for the design of the mechanism. Besides synthesis procedure, a mechanism is developed that can be used in the rehabilitation devices, bipeds, exoskeletons, etc., to benefit the society. (C) 2017 The Authors.

TI 'You're Not Alone for China': The First Song in Times of COVID-19 to
   Keep the Faith in a World Crying in Silence
SO BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES
AB Collective mourning is an expression of societal maturity, cohesion, and respect. The world is in grief, but in early January 2020, before nobody could even imagine that SARS-CoV-2 would turn into the COVID-19 pandemic, a music video version of a pop ballad about love and isolation was spread across a Chinese social network. The song 'You Are Not Alone' was adapted as a cover by young foreigners living in China to express their support to bereaved families and frontline workers and encourage the people of China, their second home. At that time, the rest of the world looked to distant China but could hardly expect to face the same adversity months later. The authors reported that the music video was a spontaneous artistic expression copying such traumatic events and the mourning process. The present work analyses how the music was blended with lyrics and images describing the outbreak in Wuhan to reach their goal. The original song and this shortened version for China were compared regarding musical and lyric structures and main characteristics. Additionally, an analysis of the two videos was done regarding cinemetric variables and non-verbal communication that emphasized the power of songs to express deep sorrow and sympathy but also to give hope. Psychological first aid, the five stages of the mourning process by Kubler-Ross, the dual-process model by Stroebe and Schut, and Taylor's tend-to-befriend provided a better understanding of the translation from interpersonal to societal mourning. Finally, other memorable songs that society spontaneously chose to be performed alone or together to cope with sudden and dramatic situations, mitigate physical distancing, and alleviate human suffering are discussed. Music, lyrics, and artistic performance are playing a key role in building social and emotional ties during this pandemic, hampering individual and social pain and sorrow despite cultural barriers.

TI Phosphatidylserine-Specific Phospholipase A1 Involved in Hepatitis C
   Virus Assembly through NS2 Complex Formation
SO JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
AB Several members of the phospholipase family have been reported to be involved in hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication. Here, we identified another phospholipase, phosphatidylserine-specific phospholipase A1 (PLA1A), as a host factor involved in HCV assembly. PLA1A was upregulated by HCV infection, and PLA1A knockdown significantly reduced J399EM (genotype 2a) HCV propagation at the assembly step but not the entry, RNA replication, and protein translation steps of the life cycle. Protein localization and interaction analysis further revealed a role of PLA1A in the interaction of NS2-E2 and NS2-NS5A, as the formation of the NS2-E2 and NS2-NS5A complexes was weakened in the absence of PLA1A. In addition, PLA1A stabilized the NS2/NS5A dotted structure during infection. These data suggest that PLA1A plays an important role in bridging the membrane-associated NS2-E2 complex and the NS5A-associated replication complex via its interaction with E2, NS2, and NS5A, which leads to a coordinating interaction between the structural and nonstructural proteins and facilitates viral assembly.
   IMPORTANCE
   Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genomic replication is driven by the replication complex and occurs at the membranous web, while the lipid droplet is the organelle in which virion assembly is initiated. In this study, we identified phosphatidylserine-specific phospholipase A1 (PLA1A), a member of phospholipase A 1 family, as a novel host factor involved in the assembly process of HCV. PLA1A, which is induced by HCV infection at a late infection stage, interacts with HCV E2, NS2, and NS5A proteins and enhances and stabilizes the NS2-E2 and NS2-NS5A complex formation, which is essential for viral assembly. Thus, PLA1A is an important host factor which is involved in the initiation of the viral assembly in close proximity to Core-decorated lipid droplets through bringing together the HCV replication complex and envelope complex.

TI ALS and FTD: an epigenetic perspective
SO ACTA NEUROPATHOLOGICA
AB Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are two fatal neurodegenerative diseases seen in comorbidity in up to 50 % of cases. Despite tremendous efforts over the last two decades, no biomarkers or effective therapeutics have been identified to prevent, decelerate, or stop neuronal death in patients. While the identification of multiple mutations in more than two dozen genes elucidated the involvement of several mechanisms in the pathogenesis of both diseases, identifying the hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9orf72, the most common genetic abnormality in ALS and FTD, opened the door to the discovery of several novel pathogenic biological routes, including chromatin remodeling and transcriptome alteration. Epigenetic processes regulate DNA replication and repair, RNA transcription, and chromatin conformation, which in turn further dictate transcriptional regulation and protein translation. Transcriptional and post-transcriptional epigenetic regulation is mediated by enzymes and chromatin-modifying complexes that control DNA methylation, histone modifications, and RNA editing. While the alteration of DNA methylation and histone modification has recently been reported in ALS and FTD, the assessment of epigenetic involvement in both diseases is still at an early stage, and the involvement of multiple epigenetic players still needs to be evaluated. As the epigenome serves as a way to alter genetic information not only during aging, but also following environmental signals, epigenetic mechanisms might play a central role in initiating ALS and FTD, especially for sporadic cases. Here, we provide a review of what is currently known about altered epigenetic processes in both ALS and FTD and discuss potential therapeutic strategies targeting epigenetic mechanisms. As approximately 85 % of ALS and FTD cases are still genetically unexplained, epigenetic therapeutics explored for other diseases might represent a profitable direction for the field.

TI Cyclooxygenase-2 regulates PTHrP transcription in human articular
   chondrocytes and is involved in the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis in
   rats
SO JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC TRANSLATION
AB Background: Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors are prescribed for the management of osteoarthritis (OA)-associated pain and inflammation. However, the role of COX-2 in normal and osteoarthritic articular chondrocytes has not been well investigated. We hypothesize that COX-2 plays a role in articular chondrocytes under normal conditions and during OA progression.
   Methods: In vivo COX-2 levels in articular cartilage of normal and papain-induced osteoarthritic rats were compared. The role of COX-2 in human articular chondrocytes (HACs) was tested in vitro by COX-2 overexpression or activity inhibition. The levels of COX-2 and marker gene for normal function or articular cartilage degeneration were evaluated: mRNA by qRT-PCR; proteins by western blotting or immunohistochemistry; and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) by Safranin O-fast green staining. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) promoter activity was detected with luciferase reporter assays.
   Results: In the OA rat study, COX-2 and PTHrP were simultaneously increased in osteoarthritic rat chondrocytes, while increased PTHrP levels were reduced by celecoxib, a COX-2 selective inhibitor. The levels of normal cartilage matrices, GAG and type II collagen decreased, while markers of degeneration, collagen type X and MMP13 were elevated in osteoarthritic articular chondrocytes. Celecoxib rescued the loss of GAG and the increased collagen type X and MMP13 levels. In vitro, COX-2 overexpression in HACs significantly increased Col2a1, Col10a1, PTHrP and MMP13 mRNA expression, which was decreased when COX-2 activity was suppressed. More importantly, COX-2 overexpression upregulated the PTHrP transcription, mRNA expression and protein levels.
   Conclusion: COX-2 plays a pathophysiological role by preventing terminal differentiation of articular chondrocytes by upregulating PTHrP expression at the early stage of OA progression.

TI A risk signature based on necroptotic-process-related genes predicts
   prognosis and immune therapy response in kidney cell carcinoma
SO FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
AB Necroptosis is a regulated form of cell necroptotic process, playing a pivotal role in tumors. In renal cell cancer (RCC), inhibiting necroptosis could promote the proliferation of tumor cells. However, the molecular mechanisms and prognosis prediction of necroptotic-process-related genes in RCC are still unclear. In this study, we first identified the necroptotic process prognosis-related genes (NPRGss) by analyzing the kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, n=607). We systematically analyzed the expression alteration, clinical relevance, and molecular mechanisms of NPRGss in renal clear cell carcinoma. We constructed an NPRGs risk signature utilizing the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression analysis on the basis of the expression of seven NPRGss. We discovered that the overall survival (OS) of KIRC patients differed significantly in high- or low-NPRGs-risk groups. The univariate/multivariate Cox regression revealed that the NPRGs risk signature was an independent prognosis factor in RCC. The gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and gene set variation analysis (GSVA) were used to explore the molecular mechanisms of NPRGss. Immune-/metabolism-related pathways showed differential enrichment in high-/low-NPRGs-risk groups. The E-MTAB-1980, TCGA-KIRP, GSE78220, the cohort of Alexandra et al., and IMvigor210 cohort datasets were respectively used as independent validation cohorts of NPRGs risk signature. The patients in high- or low-NPRGs-risk groups showed different drug sensitivity, immune checkpoint expression, and immune therapy response. Finally, we established a nomogram based on the NPRGs risk signature, stage, grade, and age for eventual clinical translation; the nomogram possesses an accurate and stable prediction effect. The signature could predict patients' prognosis and therapy response, which provides the foundation for further clinical therapeutic strategies for RCC patients.

TI Variation in lactoferrin gene affects milk lactoferrin content and
   somatic cell count in murrah buffaloes
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL RESEARCH
AB Lactoferrin plays an important role in antimicrobial defence and is a potential candidate gene for mastitis resistance. In the present investigation, polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) studies were carried out in Murrah (Bubalus bubalis) buffaloes to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of lactoferrin gene and to analyse the association between the observed polymorphisms with milk lactoferrin content and Somatic cell count (SCC). PCR-SSCP analysis revealed a total of 07 different variants in the partial coding region of the lactoferrin gene. PCR-SSCP analysis of exon 10 of lactoferrin gene revealed three and that of exons 4 and 5 revealed two unique patterns each, while all other exons exhibited monomorphic pattern. Comparison of nucleotide sequences of lactoferrin gene of the Murrah buffaloes with taurine reference sequence revealed a total of 14 point mutations, 09 of which were found to be in coding region. Conceptualized translation of nucleotide sequence revealed 07 amino acid changes. SSCP variants of exon 10 (P<0.01) had significant effect on milk SCC. The SSCP variants of exon 4 and exon 5 had significant (P<0.05) effect on lactoferrin content. The SCC and lactoferrin content in Murrah buffaloes was highest in 4th and above parity group. Stage of lactation had highly significant (P<0.01) effect on both milk SCC and lactoferrin content. There was a high and significant (p<0.01) correlation (0.741) between SCC and lactoferrin content in milk. The observed association between SSCP variants in lactoferrin gene with milk SCC and milk lactoferrin content can be used as prognostic markers for selection of animals for high lactoferrin content and low somatic cell count, as well as a marker of susceptibility/resistance to mastitis in Murrah buffaloes.

TI Inhibition of the ERK1/2-mTORC1 axis ameliorates proteinuria and the
   fibrogenic action of transforming growth factor-beta in
   Adriamycin-induced glomerulosclerosis
SO KIDNEY INTERNATIONAL
AB Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) plays crucial roles in the development of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, but key molecular pathways remain unknown. Here, we identified the regulation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex1 (mTORC1) by TGF-beta via ERK1/2 in the Adriamycin-induced murine model of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Adriamycin administration elicited early activation of TGF-beta-ERK1/2-mTORC1 in podocytes, which persisted at later stages of albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis. Phosphorylation of the TGF-beta receptor-I (TGF-beta RI), Smad3, ERK1/2 and ribosomal protein S6 were evident in the glomeruli of adriamycin-treated mice. Targeting TGF beta-RI and mTORC1 with pharmacological inhibitors suppressed TGF-beta signaling in glomeruli and significantly reduced albuminuria, glomerulosclerosis, protein levels of collagen 4 alpha 3, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and vimentin and restored mRNA levels of podocyte markers. Low dose US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved MEK/ERK inhibitor trametinib/GSK1120212 blunted TGF-beta-induced mTORC1 activation in podocytes, ameliorated upregulation of TGF-beta, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, fibronectin and alpha-smooth muscle actin and prevented albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis with improved serum albumin. In cultured podocytes, this pathway was found to be associated with translation of fibrogenic collagen 4 alpha 3 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, without influencing their transcription. Notably, rapamycin suppressed upstream p-TGF-beta RI, p-Smad3 and p-ERK1/2, and trametinib down-regulated upstream p-Smad3 in ex vivo and in vivo studies, indicating that harmful paracrine signaling among glomerular cells amplified the TGF beta-ERK1/2-mTORC1 axis by forming a positive feedback loop. Thus, an accentuated TGF-beta-ERK1/2-mTORC1 pathway is suggested as a central upstream mediator to develop proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis. Hence, preventing activation of this vicious loop by trametinib may offer a new therapeutic strategy for glomerular disease treatment.

TI 3D graph neural network with few-shot learning for predicting drug-drug
   interactions in scaffold-based cold start scenario
SO NEURAL NETWORKS
AB Understanding drug-drug interactions (DDI) of new drugs is critical for minimizing unexpected adverse drug reactions. The modeling of new drugs is called a cold start scenario. In this scenario, Only a few structural information or physicochemical information about new drug is available. The 3D conforma-tion of drug molecules usually plays a crucial role in chemical properties compared to the 2D structure. 3D graph network with few-shot learning is a promising solution. However, the 3D heterogeneity of drug molecules and the discretization of atomic distributions lead to spatial confusion in few-shot learning. Here, we propose a 3D graph neural network with few-shot learning, Meta3D-DDI, to predict DDI events in cold start scenario. The 3DGNN ensures rotation and translation invariance by calculating atomic pairwise distances, and incorporates 3D structure and distance information in the information aggregation stage. The continuous filter interaction module can continuously simulate the filter to obtain the interaction between the target atom and other atoms. Meta3D-DDI further develops a FSL strategy based on bilevel optimization to transfer meta-knowledge for DDI prediction tasks from existing drugs to new drugs. In addition, the existing cold start setting may cause the scaffold structure information in the training set to leak into the test set. We design scaffold-based cold start scenario to ensure that the drug scaffolds in the training set and test set do not overlap. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our architecture achieves the SOTA performance for DDI prediction under scaffold-based cold start scenario on two real-world datasets. The visual experiment shows that Meta3D-DDI significantly improves the learning for DDI prediction of new drugs. We also demonstrate how Meta3D-DDI can reduce the amount of data required to make meaningful DDI predictions. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The Inhibitory Effects of RFamide-Related Peptide 3 on Luteinizing
   Hormone Release Involves an Estradiol-Dependent Manner in Prepubertal
   but Not in Adult Female Mice
SO BIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION
AB The mammalian gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH) ortholog, RFamide-related peptide (RFRP), is considered to act on gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons and the pituitary to inhibit gonadotropin synthesis and release. However, there is little evidence documenting whether RFamide-related peptide 3 (RFRP-3) plays a primary role in inhibition of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis prior to the onset of puberty. The present study aimed to understand the functional significance of the neuropeptide on pubertal development. The developmental changes in reproductive-related gene expression at the mRNA level were investigated in the hypothalamus of female mice. The results indicated that RFRP-3 may be an endogenous inhibitory factor for the activation of the HPG axis prior to the onset of puberty. In addition, centrally administered RFRP-3 significantly suppressed plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) levels in prepubertal female mice. Surprisingly, centrally administered RFRP-3 had no effects on plasma LH levels in ovariectomized (OVX) prepubescent female mice. In contrast, RFRP-3 also inhibited plasma LH levels in OVX prepubescent female mice that were treated with 17beta-estradiol replacement. Our study also examined the effects of RFRP-3 on plasma LH release in adult female mice that were ovariectomized at dioestrus, with or without estradiol (E-2). Our results showed that the inhibitory effects of RFRP-3 were independent of E-2 status. Quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry analyses showed that RFRP-3 inhibited GnRH expression at both the mRNA and protein levels in the hypothalamus. These data demonstrated that RFRP-3 could effectively suppress pituitary LH release, via the inhibition of GnRH transcription and translation in prepubescent female mice, which is associated with estrogen signaling pathway and developmental stages.

TI Identification and Characterization of MicroRNAs in Ovary and Testis of
   Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) by Using Solexa Sequencing
   Technology
SO PLOS ONE
AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous non-coding small RNAs which play important roles in the regulation of gene expression by cleaving or inhibiting the translation of target gene transcripts. Thereinto, some specific miRNAs show regulatory activities in gonad development via translational control. In order to further understand the role of miRNA-mediated posttranscriptional regulation in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) ovary and testis, two small RNA libraries of Nile tilapia were sequenced by Solexa small RNA deep sequencing methods. A total of 9,731,431 and 8,880,497 raw reads, representing 5,407,800 and 4,396,281 unique sequences were obtained from the sexually mature ovaries and testes, respectively. After comparing the small RNA sequences with the Rfam database, 1,432,210 reads in ovaries and 984,146 reads in testes were matched to the genome sequence of Nile tilapia. Bioinformatic analysis identified 764 mature miRNA, 209 miRNA-5p and 202 miRNA-3p were found in the two libraries, of which 525 known miRNAs are both expressed in the ovary and testis of Nile tilapia. Comparison of expression profiles of the testis, miR-727, miR-129 and miR-29 families were highly expressed in tilapia ovary. Additionally, miR-132, miR-212, miR-33a and miR-135b families, showed significant higher expression in testis compared with that in ovary. Furthermore, the expression patterns of the miRNAs were analyzed in different developmental stages of gonad. The result showed different expression patterns were observed during development of testis and ovary. In addition, the identification and characterization of differentially expressed miRNAs in the ovaries and testis of Nile tilapia provides important information on the role of miRNA in the regulation of the ovarian and testicular development and function. This data will be helpful to facilitate studies on the regulation of miRNAs during teleosts reproduction.

TI Cortical facilitation of tactile afferents during the preparation of a
   body weight transfer when standing on a biomimetic surface
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
AB Self-generated movement shapes tactile perception, but few studies have investigated the brain mechanisms involved in the processing of the mechanical signals related to the static and transient skin deformations generated by forces and pressures exerted between the foot skin and the standing surface. We recently found that standing on a biomimetic surface (i.e., inspired by the characteristics of mechanoreceptors and skin dermatoglyphics), that magnified skin-surface interaction, increased the sensory flow to the somatosensory cortex and improved balance control compared to standing on control (e.g., smooth) surfaces. In this study, we tested whether the well-known sensory suppression that occurs during movements is alleviated when the tactile afferent signal becomes relevant with the use of a biomimetic surface. Eyes-closed participants (n = 25) self-stimulated their foot cutaneous receptors by shifting their body weight toward one of their legs while standing on either a biomimetic or a control (smooth) surface. In a control task, similar forces were exerted on the surfaces (i.e., similar skin-surface interaction) by passive translations of the surfaces. Sensory gating was assessed by measuring the amplitude of the somatosensory-evoked potential over the vertex (SEP, recorded by EEG). Significantly larger and shorter SEPs were found when participants stood on the biomimetic surface. This was observed whether the forces exerted on the surface were self-generated or passively generated. Contrary to our prediction, we found that the sensory attenuation related to the self-generated movement did not significantly differ between the biomimetic and control surfaces. However, we observed an increase in gamma activity (30-50 Hz) over centroparietal regions during the preparation phase of the weight shift only when participants stood on the biomimetic surface. This result might suggest that gamma-band oscillations play an important functional role in processing behaviorally relevant stimuli during the early stages of body weight transfer.

TI Changes in trehalose content, enzyme activity and gene expression
   related to trehalose metabolism in Flammulina velutipes under heat shock
SO MICROBIOLOGY-SGM
AB Trehalose plays important roles in the protection of organisms against adverse environmental conditions. The growth and development of Flammulina velutipes is regulated and controlled under complex external conditions. This study investigated the effect of heat stress on trehalose metabolism in mycelia and fruiting bodies. The activities of enzymes involved in trehalose metabolism, the transcriptional levels of the corresponding genes and the trehalose content in the mycelia of Flammulina velutipes strain Dan3 under relatively high temperatures were investigated. The mycelia and fruiting bodies of a strain cultivated in a factory were collected at different stages to examine the trehalose content and expression levels of various genes. The results showed that intracellular trehalose significantly accumulated in the mycelia in response to 37 degrees C heat shock. Heat shock significantly stimulated the activities of trehalose-6-phosphate synthase and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase, thereby promoting the accumulation of trehalose for the first 2-6 h. The activity of neutral trehalase also decreased during this period. In addition, changes in the activities of trehalose-6-phosphate synthase, trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase and neutral trehalase paralleled changes in the expression levels of the regulatory genes. As for the trehalose phosphorylase, the degradation of trehalose was stronger than its synthesis under heat stress. Heat shock can induce a stress response in the mycelia through the regulation of genes related to trehalose metabolism and the subsequent promotion and control of the transcription and translation of enzymes. The analysis of the trehalose and gene expression levels in the cultivated strain suggests that a substantial amount of trehalose had accumulated in the mycelia prior to induction of the primordia, and the fruiting bodies could possibly utilize degraded trehalose that translocated from the mycelia to maintain their growth.

TI Humanizing Horses: Transitions in Perception and Perspective
SO RELIGIONS
AB In Tibetan history and culture, horses were among the most important animals, if not the most important of all. Horses were the mounts that provided transport, particularly for the nobility and kings, allowing them to travel more quickly and comfortably. Horses were also used for hunting, postal services, and to build a cavalry for warfare. In addition, they played a role in various entertainments, including horse racing, games, and parades. The unusually large number of manuscripts on horses attests to the value of horses in the Tibetan imaginaire compared to other animals that lived in the company of the people on the High Plateau, in Tibet itself, and in Tibetan cultural areas. This article begins with an outline of the uses and benefits of horses in Tibetan culture. It touches upon the animal's role as the mount of Tibetan kings and debates regarding horses' mental faculties. Then it presents a survey of the content of various manuscripts on equine studies based on sources from three stages: (1) the earliest Tibetan sources from Dunhuang; (2) translations from Indian texts; and (3) extensive compendia that merges all of the knowledge on horses available at the time of their composition. It analyzes the style and content of books that indicate the approach of the authors to the topic of horse and points to their view of horses in relation to Tibetan culture and Buddhism. Moreover, the books' content mirrors the various functions and applications of horses in Tibet and India. It reveals the purpose of these books in general and illustrates the relation between textuality and orality. The study demonstrates the link between hippology and hippiatry, and the development of equine studies in Tibet. It shows the influence of humans on horse medicine and, moreover, contributes to an improved understanding of the development of Tibetan medical sciences in general.

TI The ERA-Related GTPase AtERG2 Associated with Mitochondria 18S RNA Is
   Essential for Early Embryo Development in Arabidopsis
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB The ERA (E. coli RAS-like protein)-related GTPase (ERG) is a nuclear-encoded GTPase with two conserved domains: a GTPase domain and a K Homology (KH) domain. ERG plays a vital role in early seed development in Antirrhinum majus. However, the mechanism that regulates seed development remains unclear. Blasting the genome sequence revealed two homologies of ERG, AtERG1, and AtERG2 in Arabidopsis. In this study, we found that AtERG2 is localized in the mitochondria and binds mitochondrial 18S RNA. Promoter and transcript analyses indicated that AtERG2 was mainly expressed in the leaf vein, trichome, and ovule. The T-DNA insertion lines of AtERG2 showed silique shortage, early seed abortion, and sporophytic maternal effects (SME), in which some seeds arrested in the zygotic stage at 1.5 days after pollination (DAP) and aborted at 2.0 DAP in aterg2-1 +/-. We further showed that the ovules of these arrested seeds presented unusual tissue degradation inside the embryo sacs. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulated at 1.0 and 1.5 DAP in the arrested seeds, and the transcription of several ROS-responsive genes, WRKY40, ANAC017, and AOX1a, was up-regulated in the aterg2-1 +/- arrested seeds at 1.5 and 2.0 DAP, but not in wild-type (WT) and aterg2-1 +/- developed seeds. The cell death-related gene BAG6 was also transcriptionally activated in aterg2-1 +/- seeds arrested at 2.0 DAP. Additionally, the protein level of mitochondria protein ATPase Subunit 6 was lower in 2-DAP siliques of aterg2-1 +/- than it was in those of WT. These results suggested that AtERG2 promotes early seed development by affecting the maturation of the mitochondria ribosome small subunit and mitochondrial protein translation in Arabidopsis.

TI Oocyte-specific maternal Slbp2 is required for replication-dependent
   histone storage and early nuclear cleavage in zebrafish oogenesis and
   embryogenesis
SO RNA
AB Stem-loop binding protein (SLBP) is required for replication-dependent histone mRNA metabolism in mammals. Zebrafish possesses two slbps, and slbp1 is necessary for retinal neurogenesis. However, the detailed expression and function of slbp2 in zebrafish are still unknown. In this study, we first identified zebrafish slbp2 as an oocyte-specific maternal factor and then generated a maternal-zygotic slbp2F3 homozygous mutant (MZslbp2 Delta 4(-/-)) using CRISPR/Cas9. The depletion of maternal Slbp2 disrupted early nuclear cleavage, which resulted in developmental arrest at the MBT stage. The developmental defects could be rescued in slbp2transgenic MZslbp2 Delta 4(-/-) embryos. However, homozygous mutant MZslbp1 Delta 1(-/-)developed normally, indicating slbp1 is dispensable for zebrafish early embryogenesis. Through comparative proteome and transcriptome profiling between WT and MZslbp2 Delta 4(-/- )embryos, we identified many differentially expressed proteins and genes. In comparison with those in WT embryos, four replication-dependent histones, including H2a, H2b, H3, and H4, all reduced their expression, while histone variant h2afx significantly increased in MZslbp2 Delta 4(-/- )embryos at the 256-cell stage and high stage. Zebrafish Slbp2 can bind histone mRNA stem-loop in vitro, and the defects of MZslbp2 Delta 4(-/-) embryos can be partially rescued by overexpression of H2b. The current data indicate that maternal Slbp2 plays a pivotal role in the storage of replication-dependent histone mRNAs and proteins during zebrafish oogenesis.

TI Analysis of genetic variants in the exon 2 and 3 of autosomal DAZLA gene
   among infertile South Indian men
SO MIDDLE EAST FERTILITY SOCIETY JOURNAL
AB BackgroundBoule, DAZLA, and DAZ are members of the Deleted in Azoospermia family of genes, which play significant roles in gametogenesis and are important fertility factors in humans. In a few studies, deletion of the Y chromosomal DAZ cluster and single nucleotide polymorphisms in the DAZLA gene were reported to affect male fertility, although this is paradoxical because they were found in both control and fertile men. As a result, the goal of this study was to check if Y chromosomal DAZ cluster deletion and SNPs in the DAZLA gene on chromosome 3 of humans are associated to male infertility in the population. For computational analysis, different bioinformatics tools such as SIFT, PolyPhen2, Mutation Taster, FATHMM, and PROVEAN were used to analyse mutations.ResultsWithin the studied population, we found no association between DAZ deletion and the most prevalent DAZLA SNPs A260G (rs11710967) and A386G (rs1219183446). We also discovered two new deleterious genetic variations in exon 3 of the DAZLA gene, one nonsynonymous mutation that replaced Valine with Glutamate at the 66 codon position and the other a stop gain mutation at the 74 amino acid position. These genetic changes are found in the RRM domain of the DAZLA gene, which is confirmed by Motif scan analysis and results in a change in the DAZLA protein's secondary structure. The RRM domain is a highly conserved regulatory domain for mRNA transport and translation. Azoospermia and necrospermia infertility phenotypes were shown in infertile male samples with these genotypes.ConclusionWe can conclude that further investigation of the aforesaid new mutations in the DAZLA gene may be valuable in understanding their significance in male infertility in different populations due to the multifactorial nature of male infertility and arrays of gene expression required at every stage of spermatogenesis.

TI FGF/MAPK/Ets signaling in Xenopus ectoderm contributes to neural
   induction and patterning in an autonomous and paracrine manner,
   respectively
SO CELLS & DEVELOPMENT
AB FGF and anti-BMP signals from the Spemann organizer of mesodermal origin are essential for Xenopus neural development from gastrula ectoderm. However, the detailed cellular and molecular mechanisms of signaling, especially those underlying the neural induction process, are still controversial. We show here that the expression of early neural marker genes such as sox2 and otx2 is suppressed both in vivo and in vitro, when ectoderm cells are loaded with a dominant-negative construct of Ets transcription factors or a translation-blocking antisense FGF2 MO or FGF8 MO, respectively. This indicates that the expression of these FGF signaling molecules in ectoderm cells contributes significantly to neural induction, in contrast to the "neural default model " that has been emphasized, in which anti-BMP signaling from the organizer plays a major role in the neural induction in Xenopus. Our results indicate that cell-autonomous FGF signaling between ectoderm cells, rather than paracrine signaling from organizer cells, directly induces the expression of sox2 and otx2 via the FGF2, FGF8/MAPK/Ets pathway at very low signaling levels. This is independent of inhibiting BMP signaling via the FGF/MAPK/Smad pathway, which has been proposed as the primary pathway for FGF signaling in Xenopus neural induction. Using cultured ectoderm cells, we also obtained results suggesting that the mode of contribution of FGF signaling to neural development is altered during the subsequent neural patterning stage. As we increase the amounts of FGF in the culture medium, anterior neural genes activated at low FGF signaling levels are suppressed, and instead position-specific, more posterior neural genes are activated in a dose-dependent manner via the FGF/MAPK/Ets pathway. These results support the claim that morphogenic FGFs from the organizer diffuse in a paracrine manner through the plane of the induced neuroectoderm, causing anteroposterior patterning of neural tissue.

TI MAPK and GSK3/beta-TRCP-mediated degradation of the maternal Ets domain
   transcriptional repressor Yan/Tel controls the spatial expression of
   nodal in the sea urchin embryo
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB In the sea urchin embryo, specification of the dorsal-ventral axis critically relies on the spatially restricted expression of nodal in the presumptive ventral ectoderm. The ventral restriction of nodal expression requires the activity of the maternal TGF-beta ligand Panda but the mechanism by which Panda restricts noda/expression is unknown. Similarly, what initiates expression of nodal in the ectoderm and what are the mechanisms that link patterning along the primary and secondary axes is not well understood. We report that in Paracentrotus lividus, the activity of the maternally expressed ETS-domain transcription factor Yan/Tel is essential for the spatial restriction of nodal. Inhibiting translation of maternal yan/tel mRNA disrupted dorsal-ventral patterning in all germ layers by causing a massive ectopic expression of noda/starting from cleavage stages, mimicking the phenotype caused by inactivation of the maternal Nodal antagonist Panda. We show that like in the fly or in vertebrates, the activity of sea urchin Yan/Tel is regulated by phosphorylation by MAP kinases. However, unlike in the fly or in vertebrates, phosphorylation by GSK3 plays a central role in the regulation Yan/Tel stability in the sea urchin. We show that GSK3 phosphorylates Yan/Tel in vitro at two different sites including a beta-TRCP ubiquitin ligase degradation motif and a C-terminal Ser/Thr rich cluster and that phosphorylation of Yan/Tel by GSK3 triggers its degradation by a beta-TRCP/proteasome pathway. Finally, we show that, Yan is epistatic to Panda and that the activity of Yan/Tel is required downstream of Panda to restrict nodal expression. Our results identify Yan/Tel as a central regulator of the spatial expression of nodal in Paracentrotus lividus and uncover a key interaction between the gene regulatory networks responsible for patterning the embryo along the dorsal-ventral and animal-vegetal axes.

TI To Hamlet or Not to Hamlet: Notes on an Arts Secondary School Students'
   Hamlet
SO MULTICULTURAL SHAKESPEARE-TRANSLATION APPROPRIATION AND PERFORMANCE
AB This article discusses a 2018 theatrical production of Hamlet with Romanian teenage arts students, directed by one of the article's authors, actress and academic Dana Trifan Enache. As an artist, she believes that the art of theatre spectacle depends pre-eminently on the actors' enactment, and hones her students' acting skills and technique accordingly. The other voice in the article comes from an academic in a cognate discipline within the broad field of arts and humanities. As a feminist and medievalist, the latter has investigated the political underside of representations of the body in religious drama, amongst others. The analytic duo reflects as much the authors' different professional formation and academic interests as their asymmetrical positioning vis-a-vis the show as respectively the play's director and one of its spectators. Their shared occupational investment, teaching to form and hone highly specialized professional skills, and shared object of professional interest (broadly conceived), text interpretation, account nevertheless for the possibility of fruitful interdisciplinary reflection on the 2018 Hamlet. This in-depth analysis of the circumstances of the performance and technical solutions it sought challenges stereotyped dismissals of a students' Hamlet as super-annuated, flimsy or gratuitously provocative. Furthermore, a gender-aware examination of the adaptation's original handling of characters and scenes indicates unexpected cross-cultural and diachronic commonalities between the dramatic world of the 2018 Romanian production of Hamlet and socio-cultural developments emergent in pre-Shakespearean England.

TI Arabidopsis paralogous genes RPL23aA and RPL23aB encode functionally
   equivalent proteins
SO BMC PLANT BIOLOGY
AB BackgroundIn plants, each ribosomal protein (RP) is encoded by a small gene family but it is largely unknown whether the family members are functionally diversified. There are two RPL23a paralogous genes (RPL23aA and RPL23aB) encoding cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana. Knock-down of RPL23aA using RNAi impeded growth and led to morphological abnormalities, whereas knock-out of RPL23aB had no observable phenotype, thus these two RPL23a paralogous proteins have been used as examples of ribosomal protein paralogues with functional divergence in many published papers.ResultsIn this study, we characterized T-DNA insertion mutants of RPL23aA and RPL23aB. A rare non-allelic non-complementation phenomenon was found in the F1 progeny of the rpl23aa X rpl23ab cross, which revealed a dosage effect of these two genes. Both RPL23aA and RPL23aB were found to be expressed almost in all examined tissues as revealed by GUS reporter analysis. Expression of RPL23aB driven by the RPL23aA promoter can rescue the phenotype of rpl23aa, indicating these two proteins are actually equivalent in function. Interestingly, based on the publicly available RNA-seq data, we found that these two RPL23a paralogues were expressed in a concerted manner and the expression level of RPL23aA was much higher than that of RPL23aB at different developmental stages and in different tissues.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that the two RPL23a paralogous proteins are functionally equivalent but the two genes are not. RPL23aA plays a predominant role due to its higher expression levels. RPL23aB plays a lesser role due to its lower expression. The presence of paralogous genes for the RPL23a protein in plants might be necessary to maintain its adequate dosage.

TI Nascent alt-protein chemoproteomics reveals a pre-60S assembly
   checkpoint inhibitor
SO NATURE CHEMICAL BIOLOGY
AB Many unannotated microproteins and alternative proteins (alt-proteins) are coencoded with canonical proteins, but few of their functions are known. Motivated by the hypothesis that alt-proteins undergoing regulated synthesis could play important cellular roles, we developed a chemoproteomic pipeline to identify nascent alt-proteins in human cells. We identified 22 actively translated alt-proteins or N-terminal extensions, one of which is post-transcriptionally upregulated by DNA damage stress. We further defined a nucleolar, cell-cycle-regulated alt-protein that negatively regulates assembly of the pre-60S ribosomal subunit (MINAS-60). Depletion of MINAS-60 increases the amount of cytoplasmic 60S ribosomal subunit, upregulating global protein synthesis and cell proliferation. Mechanistically, MINAS-60 represses the rate of late-stage pre-60S assembly and export to the cytoplasm. Together, these results implicate MINAS-60 as a potential checkpoint inhibitor of pre-60S assembly and demonstrate that chemoproteomics enables hypothesis generation for uncharacterized alt-proteins.

TI Lysine methyltransferase SMYD2 promotes cyst growth in autosomal
   dominant polycystic kidney disease
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION
AB Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is driven by mutations in PKD1 and PKD2 genes. Recent work suggests that epigenetic modulation of gene expression and protein function may play a role in ADPKD pathogenesis. In this study, we identified SMYD2, a SET and MYND domain protein with lysine methyltransferase activity, as a regulator of renal cyst growth. SMYD2 was upregulated in renal epithelial cells and tissues from Pkd1-knockout mice as well as in ADPKD patients. SMYD2 deficiency delayed renal cyst growth in postnatal kidneys from Pkd1 mutant mice. Pkd1 and Smyd2 double-knockout mice lived longer than Pkd1-knockout mice. Targeting SMYD2 with its specific inhibitor, AZ505, delayed cyst growth in both early-and later-stage Pkd1 conditional knockout mouse models. SMYD2 carried out its function via methylation and activation of STAT3 and the p65 subunit of NF-kappa B, leading to increased cystic renal epithelial cell proliferation and survival. We further identified two positive feedback loops that integrate epigenetic regulation and renal inflammation in cyst development: SMYD2/IL-6/STAT3/SMYD2 and SMYD2/TNF-alpha/NF-kappa B/SMYD2. These pathways provide mechanisms by which SMYD2 might be induced by cyst fluid IL-6 and TNF-alpha in ADPKD kidneys. The SMYD2 transcriptional target gene Ptpn13 also linked SMYD2 to other PKD-associated signaling pathways, including ERK, mTOR, and Akt signaling, via PTPN13-mediated phosphorylation.

TI Circular RNA in colorectal cancer
SO JOURNAL OF CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR MEDICINE
AB Circular RNA (circRNA) is a highly abundant type of single-stranded non-coding RNA. Novel research has discovered many roles of circRNA in colorectal cancer (CRC) including proliferation, metastasis and apoptosis. Furthermore, circRNAs also play a role in the development of drug resistance and have unique associations with tumour size, staging and overall survival in CRC that lend circRNAs the potential to serve as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Among cancers worldwide, CRC ranks second in mortality and third in incidence. In order to have a better understanding of the influence of circRNA on CRC development and progression, this review summarizes the role of specific circRNAs in CRC and evaluates their potential value as therapeutic targets and biomarkers for CRC. We aim to provide insight in the development of therapy and clinical decision-making.

TI Epab and Pabpc1 are differentially expressed in the postnatal mouse
   ovaries
SO JOURNAL OF ASSISTED REPRODUCTION AND GENETICS
AB In the present study, we first aimed to characterize expression levels of the Epab and Pabpc1 genes in the prepubertal (1-, 2-, and 3-week old), pubertal (4-, 5-, and 6-week old), postpubertal (16-week and 18-week old), and aged (52-, 60-, and 72-week old) mouse ovaries by using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).
   Epab mRNA was predominantly expressed in the prepubertal ovaries when compared to later developmental periods. However, Pabpc1 transcript was highly generated in the prepubertal and pubertal mouse ovaries except for 1-week old ovary than those of other developmental terms. In the prepubertal mouse ovaries, RNA in situ hybridization localized both Epab and Pabpc1 transcripts in the cytoplasm of oocytes and granulosa cells of all follicular stages. Consistently, Epab and Pabpc1 gene expression were detected in the cumulus cells and MII oocytes obtained from cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs). Ovarian follicle counting in the postnatal ovaries revealed that total number of follicles was higher in the prepubertal ovaries in comparison with later stages of development.
   As a result, Epab and Pabpc1 expression exhibit differences at postnatal ovary development stages and both genes are transcribed in the granulosa cells and oocytes. These findings suggest that EPAB may predominantly play roles in translational regulation of the mRNAs during early oogenesis and folliculogenesis, but PABPC1 most likely perform these roles in the later terms of ovarian development along with EPAB protein.

TI Between-language competition as a driving force in foreign language
   attrition
SO COGNITION
AB Research in the domain of memory suggests that forgetting is primarily driven by interference and competition from other, related memories. Here we ask whether similar dynamics are at play in foreign language (FL) attrition. We tested whether interference from translation equivalents in other, more recently used languages causes subsequent retrieval failure in L3. In Experiment 1, we investigated whether interference from the native language (L1) and/or from another foreign language (L2) affected L3 vocabulary retention. On day 1, Dutch native speakers learned 40 new Spanish (L3) words. On day 2, they performed a number of retrieval tasks in either Dutch (L1) or English (L2) on half of these words, and then memory for all items was tested again in L3 Spanish. Recall in Spanish was slower and less complete for words that received interference than for words that did not. In naming speed, this effect was larger for L2 compared to L1 interference. Experiment 2 replicated the interference effect and asked if the language difference can be explained by frequency of use differences between native- and non-native languages. Overall, these findings suggest that competition from more recently used languages, and especially other foreign languages, is a driving force behind FL attrition.

TI N6-methyladenosine modification of circ_0003215 suppresses the pentose
   phosphate pathway and malignancy of colorectal cancer through the
   miR-663b/DLG4/G6PD axis
SO CELL DEATH & DISEASE
AB Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a recently discovered kind of regulatory RNAs that have emerged as critical biomarkers of various types of cancers. Metabolic reprogramming has gradually been identified as a distinct hallmark of cancer cells. The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) plays an indispensable role in satisfying the bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands of cancer cells. However, little is known about the role of circRNAs and PPP in colorectal cancer (CRC). The novel circ_0003215 was identified at low levels in CRC and was negatively correlated with larger tumor size, higher TNM stage, and lymph node metastasis. The decreased level of circ_0003215 was resulted from the RNA degradation by m6A writer protein YTHDF2. A series of functional assays demonstrated that circ_0003215 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and CRC tumor metastasis in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, circ_0003215 regulated the expression of DLG4 via sponging miR-663b, thereby inducing the metabolic reprogramming in CRC. Mechanismly, DLG4 inhibited the PPP through the K48-linked ubiquitination of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). Taken together, we have identified m6A-modified circ_0003215 as a novel regulator of metabolic glucose reprogramming that inhibited the PPP and the malignant phenotype of CRC via the miR-663b/DLG4/G6PD axis.

TI Literary and aesthetic paradoxes of Viktor Burenin
SO SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
AB Burenin's journalistic and literary experience includes more than half a century. During this period, a paradoxical portrait of a critic prevailed in the minds of several generations. On the one hand, Burenin is the embodiment of cynicism, anger and nihilism in relation to the literary workshop. Only some people in the Russian journal-literary environment of the late 19th early 20th centuries caused such a strong rejection and disgust of contemporaries. On the other hand, Viktor Burenin was one of the most prominent figures in Russian journalism and literature of 1870-1910s. It is impossible to imagine the landscape of Russian culture of the last third of the 19th century without Burenin's invasion of journalism into literary and theatre spheres. Burenin established the rules of conduct, set the tone, and defined the style of mental life for many years ahead. He was popular, and that was close to true fame. Having created his style in journalism, he became recognizable in translations, in numerous plays and parodies intended for the stage. Burenin can be considered as some kind of a "factory" for the production of works of different kind, volume, genre. It is difficult to count everything that was created by Burenin during half a century: a few thousand texts scattered and lost in periodicals in the last third of 19th - the first decades of the 20th century. The texts were signed not only with his name but also were hiding behind masks-aliases, that became the "calling card" of Burenin: count Alexis Asminov, Vladimir Monumentov, Vyborgskii Poustynnik. All these roles created and maintained a unique status of journalism as a theatre platform for actors who share their experience with readers and writers. Burenin translated and wrote "his" plays and, in addition, acted as a literary critic and columnist. He worked out a list of his "victims"-those writers and artists whom he doggedly pursued. Exposing parodies of their works, often cruel and unjust, Burenin nevertheless contributed to the purification of art from the routine and die, freeing the way for a new aesthetic system. His great working ability provided the fame and created a smooth rhythm of the journalistic machine. Moscovite, also the inhabitant of Petersburg and later Leningrad, Viktor Burenin (1841-1926) saw a lot in his lifetime, through several eras. He was a witness and contemporary of the reforms from the Crimean disaster to the First World War and Revolution.

TI Structural Insight into Molecular Inhibitory Mechanism of InsP(6) on
   African Swine Fever Virus mRNA-Decapping Enzyme g5Rp
SO JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
AB ASF is a highly contagious hemorrhagic viral disease in domestic pigs which causes high mortality. Currently, there are still no effective vaccines or specific drugs available against this particular virus.
   Removal of 5 ' cap on cellular mRNAs by the African swine fever virus (ASFV) decapping enzyme g5R protein (g5Rp) is beneficial to viral gene expression during the early stages of infection. As the only nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety X (Nudix) decapping enzyme encoded in the ASFV genome, g5Rp works in both the degradation of cellular mRNA and the hydrolyzation of the diphosphoinositol polyphosphates. Here, we report the structures of dimeric g5Rp and its complex with inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP(6)). The two g5Rp protomers interact head to head to form a dimer, and the dimeric interface is formed by extensive polar and nonpolar interactions. Each protomer is composed of a unique N-terminal helical domain and a C-terminal classic Nudix domain. As g5Rp is an mRNA-decapping enzyme, we identified key residues, including K-8, K-94, K-95, K-98, K-175, R-221, and K-243 located on the substrate RNA binding interfaces of g5Rp which are important to RNA binding and decapping enzyme activity. Furthermore, the g5Rp-mediated mRNA decapping was inhibited by InsP(6). The g5Rp-InsP(6) complex structure showed that the InsP(6) molecules occupy the same regions that primarily mediate g5Rp-RNA interaction, elucidating the roles of InsP(6) in the regulation of the viral decapping activity of g5Rp in mRNA degradation. Collectively, these results provide the structural basis of interaction between RNA and g5Rp and highlight the inhibitory mechanism of InsP(6) on mRNA decapping by g5Rp. IMPORTANCE ASF is a highly contagious hemorrhagic viral disease in domestic pigs which causes high mortality. Currently, there are still no effective vaccines or specific drugs available against this particular virus. The protein g5Rp is the only viral mRNA-decapping enzyme, playing an essential role in the machinery assembly of mRNA regulation and translation initiation. In this study, we solved the crystal structures of g5Rp dimer and complex with InsP(6). Structure-based mutagenesis studies revealed critical residues involved in a candidate RNA binding region, which also play pivotal roles in complex with InsP(6). Notably, InsP(6) can inhibit g5Rp activity by competitively blocking the binding of substrate mRNA to the enzyme. Our structure-function studies provide the basis for potential anti-ASFV inhibitor designs targeting the critical enzyme.

TI A Novel YTHDF3-Based Model to Predict Prognosis and Therapeutic Response
   in Breast Cancer
SO FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR BIOSCIENCES
AB Background: Due to high tumor heterogeneity, breast cancer (BC) patients still suffer poor survival outcomes. YTHDF3 plays a critical role in the prognosis of BC patients. Hence, we aimed to construct a YTHDF3-based model for the prediction of the overall survival (OS) and the sensitivity of therapeutic agents in BC patients. Methods: Based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, ) database, we obtained BC patients' data (n = 999) with YTHDF3 expression profiles. The association between YTHDF3 expression and 5-year OS was determined via Cox proportional hazards regression (CPHR) analysis. By integrating the variables, we established a prognostic nomogram. The model was estimated via discrimination, calibration ability, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The performance of the model was compared with the TNM stage system through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and DCA. By means of the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database (), the therapeutic agents' response was estimated. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) demonstrated possible biological mechanisms related to YTHDF3. TIMER and CIBERSORTx were employed to analyze the association between YTHDF3 and tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Results: The high YTHDF3 expression was significantly correlated with poor 5-year OS in BC patients. Through multivariate CPHR, four independent prognostic variables (age, TNM stage, YTHDF3 expression, and molecular subtype) were determined. On the basis of the four factors, a YTHDF3-based nomogram was built. The area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC curve for the model surpassed that of the TNM stage system (0.72 vs. 0.63, p = 0.00028). The model predictions showed close consistency with the actual observations via the calibration plot. Therapeutic response prediction was conducted in high- and low-risk groups and compared with each other. The BC patients with higher risk scores showed more therapeutic resistance than those with a lower risk score. Conclusion: YTHDF3 was verified as a prognostic biomarker of BC, and a novel YTHDF3-based model was constructed to predict the 5-year OS of BC patients. Our model could be applied to effectively predict the therapeutic response of commonly used agents for BC patients.

TI Present Scenario of Circular RNAs (circRNAs) in Plants
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are new endogenous non-coding RNA family members that arise during pre-mRNA splicing in a reversed order in which the 3' and 5' ends are covalently closed. Compared to the comprehensive investigation of circRNAs in animals, circRNA research in plants is still in its infancy. Genome-wide identification and characterization of circRNAs have recently been performed in several plant species. CircRNAs are ubiquitously expressed and abundant in plants. The expression of circRNAs is often dependent on cell-type, tissue, and developmental stage, and it is particularly stress-inducible in plants. CircRNAs might play important roles in various biological processes in plants, including development and the response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Here, we review the current literature and provide a brief overview of circRNAs and their research status in plants, as well as the bioinformatic tools and database resources for circRNA analysis.

TI Genome transfer for the prevention of female infertility caused by
   maternal gene mutation
SO JOURNAL OF GENETICS AND GENOMICS
AB Poor oocyte quality is associated with early embryo developmental arrest and infertility. Maternal gene plays crucial roles in the regulation of oocyte maturation, and its mutation is a common cause of female infertility. However, how to improve oocyte quality and develop effective therapy for maternal gene mutation remains elusive. Here, we use Zar1 as an example to assess the feasibility of genome transfer to cure maternal gene mutation-caused female infertility. We first discover that cytoplasmic deficiency primarily leads to Zar1-null embryo developmental arrest by disturbing maternal transcript degradation and minor zygotic genome activation (ZGA) during the maternal-zygotic transition. We next perform genome transfer at the oocyte (spindle transfer or polar body transfer) and zygote (early pronuclear transfer or late pronuclear transfer) stages to validate the feasibility of preventing Zar1 mutation-caused infertility. We finally demonstrate that genome transfer either at the oocyte or at the early pronuclear stage can support normal preimplantation embryo development and produce live offspring. Moreover, those pups grow to adulthood and show normal fertility. Therefore, our findings provide an effective basis of therapies for the treatment of female infertility caused by maternal gene mutation.

TI Diagnostic, Therapeutic, and Prognostic Value of the m(6)A Writer
   Complex in Hepatocellular Carcinoma
SO FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has poor prognosis and is usually diagnosed only at an advanced stage. Identification of novel biomarkers is critical to early diagnosis and better prognosis for HCC patients. N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) RNA methylation regulators play important roles in the development of many tumors. However, the m(6)A writer complex, a key executor of m(6)A methylation modification, has not been independently investigated, and its specific bioinformatics analysis has not yet been performed in HCC. In this study, we used multiple public databases to evaluate the diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic value of the m(6)A writers in HCC. The results showed that expression levels of METTL3, VIRMA and CBLL1 were significantly increased, while expression levels of METTL14 and ZC3H13 were significantly decreased in HCC, which was closely related to clinicopathological factors, such as tumor stage and prognosis. Bioinformatics further explored the possible underlying mechanisms by which the m(6)A writer complex are involved in activation of tumor-promoting pathways and/or inhibition of tumor-suppressing pathways, including apoptosis, cell cycle, DNA damage response and EMT. Furthermore, we showed that the m(6)A writer complex is correlated with immune cell infiltration and immunoregulator expression in HCC. In conclusion, the m(6)A writer complex may represent a promising biomarker and target that can guide targeted therapy or immunotherapy for HCC patients.

TI Fibroblast Growth Factor-Impregnated Collagen-Gelatin Sponge Improves
   Keratinocyte Sheet Survival
SO TISSUE ENGINEERING PART A
AB Commercially available cultured epithelial keratinocyte sheets (KSs) have played an essential role in wound healing over the past four decades. Despite the initial uptake by the dermal elements, the survival rate of KS on the dermis-like tissue generated by conventional artificial dermis (AD) is low, making this method unsuitable for standard treatments. Therefore, an innovative AD such as collagen-gelatin sponge (CGS) that maintains the release of human recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) may promote wound healing. In this study, we examined whether combination therapy with KSs and CGS with bFGF (bFGF-CGS) could enhance KS survival by heterologous grafting by transplantation of human-derived KSs in an athymic nude rat wound model of staged skin reconstruction. The CGSs were implanted into skin defect wounds on athymic nude rats, which were then divided into two experimental groups: the bFGF group (CGSs containing bFGF, n = 8) and the control group (CGSs with saline, n = 8). Two weeks after implantation, human epithelial cell-derived KSs were grafted onto the dermis-like tissue, followed by assessment of the survival and morphology at 1 week later using digital imaging, histology (hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome staining), immunohistology (von Willebrand factor), immunohistochemistry (cytokeratin 1-5-6, Ki-67), and immunofluorescence (collagen IV, pan-cytokeratins) analyses. The bFGF group showed a significantly higher KS survival area (86 +/- 58 mm(2) vs. 32 +/- 22 mm(2); p < 0.05) and increased epidermal thickness (158 +/- 66 mu m vs. 86 +/- 40 mu m; p < 0.05) compared with the control group, along with higher dermis-like tissue regeneration, neovascularization, epidermal maturation, and basement membrane development. These results indicate that the survival rate of KSs in the dermis-like tissue formed by bFGF-CGS was significantly increased. Therefore, combination treatment of bFGF-CGS and KSs shows potential for full-thickness skin defect reconstruction in clinical situations.
   Impact statementThis study highlights how using a combination of cultures, keratinocyte sheets, and collagen-gelatin sponge containing basic fibroblast growth factors can significantly improve cell survival in athymic nude rats with staged skin reconstruction. Our study makes a significant contribution to the literature because it highlights a novel and improved strategy for treating a very common condition such as skin wounds arising from many conditions. Clinical translation of this study may be useful for treating skin wounds.

TI Comparative effectiveness of surgical versus nonoperative management of
   unilateral, nondisplaced, subaxial cervical spine facet fractures
   without evidence of spinal cord injury
SO JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-SPINE
AB Object. Facet joints are major stabilizers of cervical motion allowing for effortless and pain-free multidimensional cervical spine movements without significant linear or rotational translation, thus minimizing any chance for spinal cord or nerve root impingement. Unilateral, nondisplaced subaxial facet fractures do not meet the conventional criteria for spinal instability under physiological loads. Limited evidence indicates that even with no or minimal displacement, 20%-80% of these fractures fail nonoperative management. The risk factors for instability in isolated nondisplaced subaxial facet fractures remain uncertain. In this retrospective study of prospectively collected data, the authors attempted to identify the predictors of failure in the management of isolated, nondisplaced subaxial facet fractures admitted to their Level I trauma center over a 10-year period.
   Methods. Demographic, clinical, imaging, and follow-up data for 25 patients with unilateral nondisplaced subaxial facet fractures who were managed surgically (n = 10) or nonoperatively (n = 15) were statistically analyzed.
   Results. The mean age of the patients was 38 years, 19 were male, and 21 of the fractures were the result of either motor vehicle acciderits or falls. The mean motorscore on the American Spinal Injury Association scale was 99.2, and the mean Subaxial Injury Classification (SLIC) severity score was 3 (operated 3.5, nonoperated 2.3). Allen mechanistic classification included 22 compressive-extension Stage 1 and 2 distractive-extension Stage 1 fractures. Subaxial facet fractures involved C-7 in 17 patients (68%), C-6 in 7 (28%), and C-3 in 1 (4%). The anatomical plane of fracture through the lateral mass was sagittal in 12 patients, axial in 8, and coronal in 3 patients. Nondisplaced floating lateral mass injuries were noted in 2 patients. The mean instability score, considering 7 components of the discoligamentous complex on MRI, was 3.2 (operated 3.6, nonoperated 3.0). Ten (40%) of 25 patients in this investigation did not have successful management, 9 in the nonoperated and 1 in the operated group (p = 0.018). Unsuccessful management was significantly greater in younger patients (p = 0.0008), possibly indicating selection bias (p = 0.07, Wilcoxon ranksum test). Fracture plane, instability, and SLIC scores did not play a significant role in treatment failure in this study.
   Conclusions. In this study, surgery was superior to nonoperative management of isolated, nondisplaced, or minimally displaced subaxial cervical spine facet fractures.

TI Gennaro Astarita's pieces in the Oleksii Rozumovskyi music collection
SO RUKOPYSNA TA KNYZHKOVA SPADSHCHYNA UKRAINY-MANUSCRIPT AND BOOK HERITAGE
   OF UKRAINE
AB The aim of the study is to obtain information about the creative path of Italian composer G. Astarita (c. 1745-1805) by the method of complex research of his music sources available in the Music Fonds Department of the V. I. Vernadskyi National Library of Ukraine (VNLU). The methodology of the research is based on the application of methods of special historical disciplines - archeography, book studies and filigranology, musical source studies and personal empirical observations. The scientific novelty of the work. For the first time musical sources by G. Astarita from the VNLU fonds have been classified into the categories of autographs, authorized manuscripts and lifetime copies. The titles of some of the works have been clarified and some of them have been defined for the first time, possible ways of documents acquisition for the collection are outlined. It is confirmed that the handwritten score of the untitled opera ["Gernando e Costanza"] (1787, libretto "Llsola disabitata" by P. Metastasio) is the autograph of the composer. The autograph of the Aria by Compagnone (1785-1787) was introduced into scientific circulation. The score of the opera "The Vendor of Sbiten" are copies of the 18th century (c. 1786 year). For the first time, an extended list of G. Astarita's operas, compiled from various sources, with an indication of the genre, location and time of the premiere, supplemented by a translation of the titles into Ukrainian. Conclusions. The information from the manuscripts made it possible to adjust assertion about the composer's creative heritage and biography, including his location in 1785-1787. In total, G. Astarita has written about 60 operas, almost 40 of them are varieties of Italian comic opera (drama giocoso, opera buffa, farsa), and 7 opera seria. G. Astarita's operas were competitive in the 18th century judging from the repertoire of theaters and his music was supported by the general public. At the same time, the information obtained allowed us to contribute to the definition of musical tastes of representatives of the Ukrainian elite of the 18th century, since this documents are part of the music collection of Oleksii Rozumovskyi.

TI Designing an App to Overcome Language Barriers in the Delivery of
   Emergency Medical Services: Participatory Development Process
SO JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH
AB Background: In emergencies, language barriers may have dangerous consequences for the patients. There have been some technical approaches to overcome language barriers in medical care but not yet in the prehospital emergency care setting. The use of digital technologies in health care is expanding rapidly. Involving end users at all stages of the development process may help to ensure such technologies are usable and can be implemented.
   Objective: We aimed to develop a digital communication tool that addresses paramedic needs in the specific circumstances of prehospital emergency care and helps paramedics to overcome language barriers when providing care to foreign-language patients. Methods: We actively engaged paramedics and software designers in an action-oriented, participatory, iterative development process, which included field observations, workshops, background conversations, questionnaires on rescue missions, studying the literature, and preliminary testing in the field.
   Results: With input from paramedics, we created an app with 600 fixed phrases supporting 18 languages. The app includes medical history-taking questions, phrases asking for consent, and phrases providing specific additional information. Children as patients, as well as their carers and other third parties, can be addressed with appropriate wording. All phrases can be played back audibly or displayed as text. The comprehensive content is grouped into categories and adapted to diverse scenarios, which makes the tool rapidly usable. The app includes a function to document patient responses and the conversation history. For evaluation in a clinical study, the app is run on a smartphone with extra speakers to be of use in noisy environments. The use of prototypes proved valuable to verify that the content, structure, and functions discussed in theory were of value and genuinely needed in practice and that the various device control elements were intuitive.
   Conclusions: The nature of the paramedic work environment places specific demands on the communication options used and need for such devices. The active involvement of paramedics in the development process allowed us to understand and subsequently consider their experience-based knowledge. Software designers could understand the paramedics' work environment and consider respective needs in the menu navigation and design principles of the app. We argue that the development of any medical software product should actively involve both end users and developers in all phases of the development process. Providing the users with the opportunity to influence technology development ensures that the result is closer to their needs, which can be seen as crucial for successful implementation and sustainable use.

TI Ycf93 (Orf105), a Small Apicoplast-Encoded Membrane Protein in the
   Relict Plastid of the Malaria Parasite Plasmodium falciparum That Is
   Conserved in Apicomplexa
SO PLOS ONE
AB Malaria parasites retain a relict plastid (apicoplast) from a photosynthetic ancestor shared with dinoflagellate algae. The apicoplast is a useful drug target; blocking housekeeping pathways such as genome replication and translation in the organelle kills parasites and protects against malaria. The apicoplast of Plasmodium falciparum encodes 30 proteins and a suite of rRNAs and tRNAs that facilitate their expression. orf105 is a hypothetical apicoplast gene that would encode a small protein (PfOrf105) with a predicted C-terminal transmembrane domain. We produced antisera to a predicted peptide within PfOrf105. Western blot analysis confirmed expression of orf105 and immunofluorescence localised the gene product to the apicoplast. Pforf105 encodes a membrane protein that has an apparent mass of 17.5 kDa and undergoes substantial turnover during the 48-hour asexual life cycle of the parasite in blood stages. The effect of actinonin, an antimalarial with a putative impact on post-translational modification of apicoplast proteins like PfOrf105, was examined. Unlike other drugs perturbing apicoplast housekeeping that induce delayed death, actinonin kills parasites immediately and has an identical drug exposure phenotype to the isopentenyl diphosphate synthesis blocker fosmidomycin. Open reading frames of similar size to PfOrf105, which also have predicted C-terminal trans membrane domains, occur in syntenic positions in all sequenced apicoplast genomes from Phylum Apicomplexa. We therefore propose to name these genes ycf93 (hypothetical chloroplast reading frame 93) according to plastid gene nomenclature convention for conserved proteins of unknown function.

TI METTL3-mediated N6-methyladenosine modification of DUSP5 mRNA promotes
   gallbladder-cancer progression
SO CANCER GENE THERAPY
AB N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) RNA methylation and its associated methyltransferase METTL3 play an important role in tumorigenesis of a series of tumors. However, dysregulation of METTL3 in gallbladder cancer (GBC) remains obscure. Here, we showed that upregulated METTL3 level predicted poor prognosis and correlated with increased lymphatic metastasis and high TNM stage. Functionally, we found that METTL3 could promote cell proliferation, invasion, and migration of GBC-SD and NOZ cells. Mechanistically, we revealed the METTL3-mediated m(6)A-modification profile in GBC cells and identified DUSP5 as the downstream gene of METTL3. METTL3 promoted the degradation of DUSP5 mRNA in a YTHDF2-dependent manner. Rescue assays showed that downregulation of DUSP5 could attenuate the knockdown METTL3-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation, invasion, and migration of GBC-SD and NOZ cells. Thus, our finding shows that elevated METTL3 expression contributes to tumor aggression in GBC, suggesting that METTL3 is a possible prognostic predictor and therapeutic target against GBC.

AB Circular RNAs (CircRNAs), as a new class of non-coding RNA molecules that, unlike linear RNAs, have covalently closed loop structures from the ligation of exons, introns, or both. CircRNAs are widely expressed in various organisms in a specie-, tissue-, disease- and developmental stage-specific manner, and have been demonstrated to play a vital role in the pathogenesis and progression of human diseases. An increasing number of recent studies has revealed that circRNAs are intensively associated with different respiratory diseases, including lung cancer, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary tuberculosis, and silicosis. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no systematic review of studies on the role of circRNAs in respiratory diseases. In this review, we elaborate on the biogenesis, functions, and identification of circRNAs and focus particularly on the potential implications of circRNAs in respiratory diseases.

TI Dito und Idem. A Case of Feminine Literary Collaboration in Belle
   Epoque. Between "Negotiation" and "Compromise"
SO PHILOLOGICA JASSYENSIA
AB The phenomenon of literary collaboration is rather an exception in the history of literature so that the brave project in which two female authors from the nineteenth century are joining their creative forces is once more unusual and worthy of consideration. After a series of individual literary projects and one common volume of translations, the German writers Carmen Sylva and Mite Kremnitz decide to set up a common literary project - Dito und Idem - that will last for a period of six years (1882.1888) and that will sum up three epistolary novels, one tragic drama and two volumes of short stories. Analysing this form of literary collaboration proves to be challenging for any researcher, by revealing a whole field that is worth exploring from the perspective of the theory of literature. In such rare cases, the genesis of the work is no longer an intimate process, directly between an author and his work, but an unveiled one, that is, shared with the otherness. Similarly the work is no longer the direct expression of the individual author`s will and his artistic conceptions, but the product of a "negotiation" between two auctorial instances. The receiver himself, even the unsuspecting one, faced with a literary text that has two authors becomes suddenly aware of and interested in questions of literary theory, which in other circumstances he would probably neglect. He will ask natural questions, such as: " How is it possible to write a book on the double?", " Who took the initiative of a work?", " What is the relationship between the authors?" "How can they share roles and how do they communicate each other's intentions?" etc. Following his footsteps we intend to reconstruct the scaffolding of literary and paraliterary details, which influenced decisively the work of the tandem Dito und Idem. The present approach - we believe - also makes for a reflection on the forms of existence of art itself, because in this interesting game of auctorial perspectives, the creation is disputing its legitimacy, by occupying at a time either the privileged status of an object of negotiation and emulation between two creative minds or the degrading role of a bastard, as result of a miserable compromise.

TI Natural tuning of restriction endonuclease synthesis by cluster of rare
   arginine codons
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Restriction-modification (R-M) systems are highly widespread among bacteria and archaea, and they appear to play a pivotal role in modulating horizontal gene transfer, as well as in protecting the host organism against viruses and other invasive DNA particles. Type II R-M systems specify two independent enzymes: a restriction endonuclease (REase) and protective DNA methyltransferase (MTase). If the cell is to survive, the counteracting activities as toxin and antitoxin, must be finely balanced in vivo. The molecular basis of this regulatory process remains unclear and current searches for regulatory elements in R-M modules are focused mainly at the transcription step. In this report, we show new aspects of REase control that are linked to translation. We used the EcoVIII R-M system as a model. Both, the REase and MTase genes for this R-M system contain an unusually high number of rare arginine codons (AGA and AGG) when compared to the rest of the E. coli K-12 genome. Clusters of these codons near the N-terminus of the REase greatly affect the translational efficiency. Changing these to higher frequency codons for E. coli (CGC) improves the REase synthesis, making the R-M system more potent to defend its host against bacteriophages. However, this improved efficiency in synthesis reduces host fitness due to increased autorestriction. We hypothesize that expression of the endonuclease gene can be modulated depending on the host genetic context and we propose a novel post-transcriptional mode of R-M system regulation that alleviates the potential lethal action of the restriction enzyme.

TI Bovine ephemeral fever virus triggers autophagy enhancing virus
   replication via upregulation of the Src/JNK/AP1 and PI3K/Akt/NF-kappa B
   pathways and suppression of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway
SO VETERINARY RESEARCH
AB Autophagy plays an important role in cellular response to pathogens. However, the impact of the autophagy machinery on bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV) infection is not yet determined. A recent study in our laboratory demonstrated that BEFV triggers simultaneously the PI3K/Akt/NF-kappa B and Src/JNK-AP1 pathways in the stage of virus binding to enhance virus entry. In this work, we report that BEFV induces autophagy via upregulation of the PI3K/Akt/NF-kappa B and Src/JNK/AP1 pathways in the early to middle stages of infection and suppresses the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway at the late stage of infection. To activate NF-kappa B, BEFV promotes degradation of I kappa B alpha and activates Akt to stimulate NF-kappa B translocation into the nucleus. Immunoprecipitation assays revealed that BEFV disrupts Beclin 1 and Bcl-2 interaction by JNK-mediated Bcl-2 phosphorylation, thereby activating autophagy. Overexpression of Bcl-2 reversed the BEFV-induced increase in the LC3 II levels. Suppression of autophagy either by knockdown of autophagy-related genes with shRNAs or treatment with a pharmacological inhibitor 3-MA reduced BEFV replication, suggesting that BEFV-induced autophagy benefits virus replication. Our results revealed that the BEFV M protein is one of the viral proteins involved in inducing autophagy via suppression of the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 pathway. Furthermore, degradation of p62 was observed by immunoblotting, suggesting that BEFV infection triggers a complete autophagic response. Disruption of autophagosome-lysosome fusion by depleting LAMP2 resulted in reduction of virus yield, suggesting that formation of autolysosome benefits virus production.

TI m6A Topological Transition Coupled to Developmental Regulation of Gene
   Expression During Mammalian Tissue Development
SO FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent internal modification and reversible epitranscriptomic mark in messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and plays essential roles in a variety of biological processes. However, the dynamic distribution patterns of m6A and their significance during mammalian tissue development are poorly understood. Here, we found that based on m6A distribution patterns, protein-coding genes were classified into five groups with significantly distinct biological features and functions. Strikingly, comparison of the m6A methylomes of multiple mammalian tissues between fetal and adult stages revealed dynamic m6A topological transition during mammalian tissue development, and identified large numbers of genes with significant m6A loss in 5 ' UTRs or m6A gain around stop codons. The genes with m6A loss in 5 ' UTRs were highly enriched in developmental stage-specific genes, and their m6A topological transitions were strongly associated with gene expression regulation during tissue development. The genes with m6A gain around the stop codons were associated with tissue-specific functions. Our findings revealed the existence of different m6A topologies among protein-coding genes that were associated with distinct characteristics. More importantly, these genes with m6A topological transitions were crucial for tissue development via regulation of gene expression, suggesting the importance of dynamic m6A topological transitions during mammalian tissue development.

TI Identification of genetic variants in m(6)A modification genes
   associated with pancreatic cancer risk in the Chinese population
SO ARCHIVES OF TOXICOLOGY
AB N6-Methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most prevalent modification of RNA in eukaryotes, and is associated with many cellular processes and even the development of cancers. We hypothesized that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in m(6)A modification genes, including its "writers", "erasers" and "readers", might affect the m(6)A functions and associate with the susceptibility to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We first conducted a two-stage case-control study in Chinese population to interrogate all SNPs in 22 m(6)A modification genes. In the discovery stage, a total of 2735 SNPs were genotyped in 980 patients and 1991 controls. Then, the promising SNP was replicated in another independent population consisting of 858 cases and 2084 controls. As a result, we found the rs7495 in 3 ' UTR of hnRNPC was significantly associated with increased risk of PDAC in both stages (combined odds ratio = 1.22, 95% confidence interval = 1.12-1.32, P = 2.39 x 10(-6)). To further reveal the biological function of rs7495 and hnRNPC, we performed a series of biochemical experiments. Luciferase reporter assays indicated that rs7495G allele promoted hnRNPC expression through disrupting a putative binding site for has-miR-183-3p. Cell viability assay demonstrated that knockdown of hnRNPC suppressed the proliferation of PDAC cells. RNA-seq analysis suggested that as an m(6)A "reader", hnRNPC played an important role in RNA biological processes. In conclusion, our findings elucidated that rs7495G could confer higher risk of PDAC via promoting the expression of hnRNPC through a miRNA-mediated manner. These results provided a novel insight into the critical role of m(6)A modification in tumorigenesis.

TI Analysis and Validation of circRNA-miRNA Network in Regulating m(6)A RNA
   Methylation Modulators Reveals CircMAP2K4/miR-139-5p/YTHDF1 Axis
   Involving the Proliferation of Hepatocellular Carcinoma
SO FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
AB The m(6)A RNA methylation modulators play a crucial role in regulating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression. The circular RNA (circRNA) regulatory network in regulating m(6)A RNA methylation modulators in HCC remains largely unknown. In this study, 5 prognostic m(6)A RNA methylation modulators in HCC were identified from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) projects. The differentially expressed microRNAs (DEmiRNAs) and circRNAs (DEcircRNAs) between paired tumor and normal tissues were screened out from TCGA and or Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to construct the circRNA-miRNA- m(6)A RNA methylation modulator regulatory network, which included three m(6)A RNA methylation modulators (HNRNPC, YTHDF1, and YTHDF2), 11 DEmiRNAs, and eight DEcircRNAs. Among the network, hsa-miR-139-5p expression was negatively correlated with YTHDF1. Hsa-miR-139-5p low or YTHDF1 high expression was correlated with high pathological grade, advanced stage and poor survival of HCC. Additionally, cell cycle, base excision repair, and homologous recombination were enriched in YTHDF1 high expression group by GSEA. A hub circRNA regulatory network was constructed based on hsa-miR-139-5p/YTHDF1 axis. Furthermore, hsa_circ_0007456(circMAP2K4) was validated to promote HCC cell proliferation by binding with hsa-miR-139-5p to promote YTHDF1 expression. Taken together, we identified certain circRNA regulatory network related to m(6)A RNA methylation modulators and provided clues for mechanism study and therapeutic targets for HCC.

TI N6-methyladenosine mRNA methylation is important for the light response
   in soybean
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) modification of messenger RNA (mRNA) is the most prevalent and abundant modification in eukaryotic mRNA and posttranscriptionally modulates the transcriptome at almost all stages of mRNA metabolism. In plants, m(6)A is crucial for embryonic-phase growth, flowering time control, microspore generation and fruit maturation. However, the role of m(6)A in plant responses to light, the most important environmental stimulus, remains unexplored. Here, we profile the m(6)A transcriptome of Williams 82, a soybean cultivar, and reveal that m(6)A is highly conserved and plays an important role in the response to light stimuli in soybean. Similar to the case in Arabidopsis, m(6)A in soybean is enriched not only around the stop codon and within the 3'UTR but also around the start codon. Moreover, genes with methylation occurring in the 3'UTR have higher expression levels and are more prone to alternative splicing. The core genes in the light signaling pathway, GmSPA1a, GmPRR5e and GmBIC2b, undergo changes in methylation modification and transcription levels in response to light. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes with differential m(6)A peaks were involved in the "photosynthesis" and "circadian rhythm" pathways. Our results highlight the important role played by epitranscriptomic mRNA methylation in the light response in soybean and provide a solid basis for determining the functional role of light on RNA m(6)A modification in this plant.

TI Interpreters and interpreting in conflict zones and scenarios: A
   historical perspective
SO LINGUISTICA ANTVERPIENSIA NEW SERIES-THEMES IN TRANSLATION STUDIES
AB This article presents an overview of interpreting in conflict zones and scenarios in different periods of history as represented in the papers included in the special issue. Conflict between parties with different cultural and linguistic backgrounds is pervasive in human history and has always involved interpreters in the sense of intercultural and linguistic mediators. Although interpreting became highly professionalized from the second half of the twentieth century, language brokering in conflict zones is still an unregulated occupation mainly pursued by untrained interpreters. Furthermore, there is a lack of recognition of the specific role that interpreters in conflict situations play. In spite of an increasing awareness of the role of interpreters in conflict zones and an expanding scholarly literature on the subject, we believe that more monographs adopting a historical standpoint are needed. The aim of this special volume is to shed light on the characteristics, ideology, status, neutrality, occupation, role in the different stages of the conflict, training issues, and working practices and procedures of interpreters in conflict zones.

TI Progress in Understanding the Relationship Between Circular RNAs and
   Neurological Disorders
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR NEUROSCIENCE
AB Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a type of endogenous noncoding RNAs distinct from linear forms, are produced by backsplicing events within genes. circRNAs are structurally stable, highly conserved molecules found widely in organisms, and display tissue-type and developmental-stage specific expression patterns, which reveal their significant regulatory functions in gene expression. Based on accumulating evidence, some circRNAs are now believed to be a class of competitive endogenous RNAs that regulate gene expression. For example, circRNAs may prevent microRNAs from inhibiting target RNAs acting as microRNA sponges, or interact with RNA binding proteins and thereby efficiently and post-transcriptionally regulate expression of the parental and other genes. In addition, an increasing number of studies have shown that circRNAs play important roles in the development and progression of neurological disorders. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview on the biogenesis, characteristics, and functions of circRNAs. We also discuss the critical role of circRNAs in neurological disorders.

TI alpha-Phenylalanyl tRNA synthetase competes with Notch signaling through
   its N-terminal domain
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB The alpha subunit of the cytoplasmic Phenylalanyl tRNA synthetase (alpha-PheRS, FARSA in humans) displays cell growth and proliferation activities and its elevated levels can induce cell fate changes and tumor-like phenotypes that are neither dependent on the canonical function of charging tRNA(Phe) with phenylalanine nor on stimulating general translation. In intestinal stem cells of Drosophila midguts, alpha-PheRS levels are naturally slightly elevated and human FARSA mRNA levels are elevated in multiple cancers. In the Drosophila midgut model, elevated alpha-PheRS levels caused the accumulation of many additional proliferating cells resembling intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and enteroblasts (EBs). This phenotype partially resembles the tumor-like phenotype described as Notch RNAi phenotype for the same cells. Genetic interactions between alpha-PheRS and Notch suggest that their activities neutralize each other and that elevated alpha-PheRS levels attenuate Notch signaling when Notch induces differentiation into enterocytes, type II neuroblast stem cell proliferation, or transcription of a Notch reporter. These non-canonical functions all map to the N-terminal part of alpha-PheRS which accumulates naturally in the intestine. This truncated version of alpha-PheRS (alpha-S) also localizes to nuclei and displays weak sequence similarity to the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), suggesting that alpha-S might compete with the NICD for binding to a common target. Supporting this hypothesis, the tryptophan (W) residue reported to be key for the interaction between the NICD and the Su(H) BTD domain is not only conserved in alpha-PheRS and alpha-S, but also essential for attenuating Notch signaling.
   Author summaryAminoacyl tRNA synthetases charge tRNAs with their cognate amino acid to ensure proper decoding of the genetic code during translation. Independent of its aminoacylation function, the alpha subunit of Drosophila cytoplasmic Phenylalanyl tRNA synthetase (alpha-PheRS, FARSA in humans) has an additional activity that promotes growth and proliferation. Here we describe that elevated alpha-PheRS levels also induce cell fate changes and tumorous phenotypes in Drosophila midguts. Excessive proliferating cells with stem and progenitor cell characteristics accumulate and the composition of the terminally differentiated cells changes, too. This phenotype together with observed genetic interactions between alpha-PheRS and Notch levels show that alpha-PheRS counteracts Notch signaling in many different tissues and developmental stages. This novel activity of alpha-PheRS maps to its N-terminal part, which is naturally produced. The fragment contains a DNA binding domain, translocates into nuclei, and displays essential similarities to a Notch domain that binds to the downstream transcription factor. This suggests that it might be competing with Notch for binding to a common target. Not only because Notch plays important roles in many tumors, but also because FARSA mRNA levels are considerably upregulated in many tumors, this novel activity deserves more attention for cancer research.

TI The contribution of copper efflux transporters ATP7A and ATP7B to
   chemoresistance and personalized medicine in ovarian cancer
SO BIOMEDICINE & PHARMACOTHERAPY
AB Ovarian cancer has the highest mortality rate among all gynecologic cancers, with most patients presenting with advanced stage tumors. About a third of patients do not respond to primary platinum-based chemotherapy treatment, and over time up to 80 % of others develop chemoresistance, rendering recurrent disease incurable. Moreover, according to latest EMSO-ESGO (European Society for Medical Oncology - European Society for Gynecological Oncology) consensus conference manuscript on ovarian cancer, there are currently no validated molecular predictive biomarkers for platinum resistance. Recent studies suggest that the copper efflux transporters ATP7A and ATP7B play an important role in platinum resistance. In addition, by exploring their role in mediating resistance, new pathways of platinum resistance emerge, such as lysosomal storage disorders, which might be explored in the future as a new target to circumvent platinum resistance. This review outlines a challenging clinical hurdle in ovarian cancer therapy due to platinum resistance, links between the essential trace element copper and cytotoxic platinum-based medicines, and enigmatic mechanisms of ATP7A and ATP7B mediating platinum resistance. It then presents clinical studies showing a significant association of ATP7A and ATP7B with response to cisplatin/carboplatin and prognosis. Based on the results of in vitro assays, disease-relevant animal models, and clinical studies to date, it may be concluded that APT7A and ATP7B deserve further development as predictive markers of platinum resistance in ovarian cancer. Both transporters could play a particularly important role in early estimation of therapy response to identify platinum-resistant tumors and to adjust the treatment of ovarian cancer patients accordingly.

TI Circular RNAs in hepatocellular carcinoma: Functions and implications
SO CANCER MEDICINE
AB At present, as hotspot members of the noncoding RNA network, circular RNAs (circRNAs) with distinct properties and diverse pathophysiological functions are being increasingly delineated. CircRNAs play roles at the epigenetic, transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory levels. Major studies have focused on their functions as efficient microRNA sponges. The validated number of endogenous circRNAs involved in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) continues to increase. Altered circRNA expression is associated with HCC occurrence, invasion, and metastasis. Moreover, the aberrant expression of circRNAs is also significantly related to HCC tumor stage, size, differentiation and metastasis. Because they are exceptionally stable, highly conserved and have tissue-specific expression patterns, some circRNAs, including hsa_circ_0004018, hsa_circ_0003570, and hsa_circ_0005075, may be potential markers for the diagnosis of HCC. We herein summarize the current knowledge of HCC-associated circRNAs and present their implications for carcinogenesis and their potential value as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Finally, we discuss the future directions of studies on HCC-associated circRNAs.

TI EIF2S2 is a novel independent prognostic biomarker and correlated with
   immune infiltrates in hepatocellular carcinoma
SO FRONTIERS IN GENETICS
AB Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly malignant disease with poor prognosis. It is urgent to find effective biomarkers. Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 2 Subunit Beta (EIF2S2) is a subunit of heterotrimeric G protein EIF2, and its function is still unclear. We studied the role of EIF2S2 in the malignant progression of liver cancer and its relationship with immune infiltration. Methods: Download the RNA expression and clinical information of EIF2S2 from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, analyze the relationship between the expression of EIF2S2 and the prognosis and clinicopathological characteristics of HCC, analyze the differential genes by Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and tumor related immune infiltrating cells. The Protein expression level of EIF2S2 was obtained from Human Protein Atlas (HPA) databases. The relationship between EIF2S2 expression and immune infiltrates in HCC was analyzed on TIMER 2.0. The data processing analysis based on R language. Drug Sensitivity data from Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC). Results: EIF2S2 is highly expressed in HCC patients and is associated with poor prognosis. The expression of EIF2S2 was also correlated with age, clinical stage and pathological grade. Univariate and multivariate COX regression analysis showed that EIF2S2 was an independent risk factor for survival. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of EIF2S2 also confirmed the diagnostic value of EIF2S2 in HCC patients. Through GO and KEGG enrichment analysis, EIF2S2 expression was found to be closely related to some immune pathways. The expression of EIF2S2 was correlated with memory B cell, plasma B cell, CD8+ T cell, CD4+ resting memory T cell and the expression of some immune checkpoints, such as PDCD1, TIGIT and CTLA-4. It is also more sensitive to paclitaxel, sunitinib and other drugs. Conclusion: This study shows that EIF2S2 can be used as a prognostic factor for HCC, which is closely related to immune infiltration and immune checkpoints, and may play a potential regulatory role in predicting drug sensitivity.

TI Rel Is Required for Morphogenesis of Resting Cells in Mycobacterium
   smegmatis
SO FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB Recently we showed that upon transfer of growing Mycobacterium smegmatis into saline, the bacilli exited the canonical cell division cycle and formed septated multi-nucleoided cells. Under shock starvation (i.e., in saline without any carbon source), differentiation terminated at this stage with internally remodeled Large Resting Cells (LARCs). Whereas under gentle starvation (i.e., in saline with trace amounts of a carbon source), the septated multi-nucleoided bacilli completed cell division and separated into mono-nucleoided Small Resting Cells (SMRCs). This demonstrated that the non-sporulating mycobacteria are in fact capable of forming morphologically differentiated resting cells when exposed to starvation. Depending on the specific starvation conditions they can form two different resting cell types, LARCs or SMRCs, which share a common cellular differentiation pathway. The mRNA encoding the (p)ppGpp synthetase Rel was found to be transiently upregulated immediately upon starvation under both conditions, suggesting a role for the stringent response factor in both LARC and SMRC development. Here, we disrupted Rel function by generating two types of mutant M. smegmatis strains: a rel nonsense mutant (re/(E4TAG)) in which translation is prematurely terminated at codon 4, and a rel deletion mutant (Are!) in which the entire coding sequence was deleted. Both mutants showed identical phenotypes: sparse septum formation, less DNA compaction, and failure in formation of both the septated multi-nucleoided LARCs and the small-cell morphotype SMRC under starvation conditions. All phenotypes were rescued through the introduction of a wild type copy of rel. Therefore, we conclude that loss-of-function mutations in rel block the development of both LARCs and SMRCs by preventing the first morphogenetic step in mycobacterial resting cell development, the formation of septated multi-nucleoided cells. Interestingly, in contrast to Rel's role in most other bacteria, starvation survival was not affected by loss of rel function. Our results suggest that Rel may play a starvation-induced morphogenetic role in mycobacteria.

TI Underlying Mechanisms and Candidate Drugs for COVID-19 Based on the
   Connectivity Map Database
SO FRONTIERS IN GENETICS
AB Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide public health crisis. At present, there are no effective antiviral drugs to treat COVID-19. Although some vaccines have been developed, late-stage clinical trials that allow licensure by regulatory agencies are still needed. Previous reports have indicated that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and SARS-CoV are highly homologous and both use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor to enter cells, and SARS-CoV infection reduces the ACE2 expression in the lung. Therefore, the analysis of genes co-expressed with ACE2 in the lung may uncover the underlying mechanism of COVID-19. Finally, we used the Connectivity map (Cmap) database to search for candidate drugs using transcriptome profiles of patients with COVID-19. Method Based on the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), indicated by the expression of RNAs isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells of patients with COVID-19, we performed functional enrichment analysis and hub gene cluster analysis. Furthermore, we identified genes co-expressed with ACE2 in healthy lung samples and analyzed the significant genes. Additionally, to identify several candidate drugs for the treatment of COVID-19, we queried Cmap using DEGs and genes co-expressed with ACE2. Results and Conclusion The up-regulated genes in the BALF cells of patients with COVID-19 are related to viral mRNA translation. The down-regulated genes are related to immune response functions. Genes positively correlated with ACE2 are related to immune defense and those negatively correlated are enriched in synaptic transmission functions. The results reflected prosperous viral proliferation and immune dysfunction in patients. Furthermore, ACE2 may not only mediate viral entrance, but also play an important role in immune defense. By using Cmap with transcriptome profiles of patients with COVID-19, we identified candidate drugs for the treatment of COVID-19, such as amantadine and acyclovir.

TI Hypomorphic zebrafish models mimic the musculoskeletal phenotype of beta
   4GalT7-deficient Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
SO MATRIX BIOLOGY
AB beta 4GalT7 is a transmembrane Golgi enzyme, encoded by B4GALT7, that plays a pivotal role in the proteoglycan linker region formation during proteoglycan biosynthesis. Defects in this enzyme give rise to a rare autosomal recessive form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), currently known as `spondylodysplastic EDS (spEDS-B4GALT7)'. This EDS subtype is mainly characterized by short stature, hypotonia and skeletal abnormalities, thereby illustrating its pleiotropic importance during human development. Insights into the pathogenic mechanisms underlying this disabling disease are very limited, in part due to the lack of a relevant in vivo model.
   As the majority of mutations identified in patients with spEDS-B4GALT7 are hypomorphic, we generated zebrafish models with partial loss of B4galt7 function, including different knockdown (morphant) and mosaic knockout (crispant) b4galt7 zebrafish models and studied the morphologic, functional and molecular aspects in embryonic and larval stages.
   Morphant and crispant zebrafish show highly similar morphological abnormalities in early development including a small, round head, bowed pectoral fins, short body-axis and mild developmental delay. Several craniofacial cartilage and bone structures are absent or strongly misshapen. In addition, the total amount of sulfated glycosaminoglycans is significantly diminished and particularly heparan and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan levels are greatly reduced. We also show impaired cartilage patterning and loss of chondrocyte organization in a cartilage-specific Tg(Col2a1aBAC:mcherry) zebrafish reporter line. The occurrence of the same abnormalities in the different models confirms these are specifically caused by B4galt7 deficiency. A disturbed actin pattern, along with a lack of muscle tone, was only noted in morphants in which translation of b4galt7 was blocked.
   In conclusion, we generated the first viable animal models for spEDS-B4GALT7, and show that in early development the human spEDS-B4GALT7 phenotype is faithfully mimicked in these zebrafish models. Our findings underscore a key role for beta 4GalT7 in early development of cartilage, bone and muscle. These models will lead to a better understanding of spEDS-B4GALT7 and can be used in future efforts focusing on therapeutic applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI T-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia: Biomarkers and Their Clinical
   Usefulness
SO GENES
AB T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL) are immature lymphoid tumors localizing in the bone marrow, mediastinum, central nervous system, and lymphoid organs. They account for 10-15% of pediatric and about 25% of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases. It is a widely heterogeneous disease that is caused by the co-occurrence of multiple genetic abnormalities, which are acquired over time, and once accumulated, lead to full-blown leukemia. Recurrently affected genes deregulate pivotal cell processes, such as cycling (CDKN1B, RB1, TP53), signaling transduction (RAS pathway, IL7R/JAK/STAT, PI3K/AKT), epigenetics (PRC2 members, PHF6), and protein translation (RPL10, CNOT3). A remarkable role is played by NOTCH1 and CDKN2A, as they are altered in more than half of the cases. The activation of the NOTCH1 signaling affects thymocyte specification and development, while CDKN2A haploinsufficiency/inactivation, promotes cell cycle progression. Among recurrently involved oncogenes, a major role is exerted by T-cell-specific transcription factors, whose deregulated expression interferes with normal thymocyte development and causes a stage-specific differentiation arrest. Hence, TAL and/or LMO deregulation is typical of T-ALL with a mature phenotype (sCD3 positive) that of TLX1, NKX2-1, or TLX3, of cortical T-ALL (CD1a positive); HOXA and MEF2C are instead over-expressed in subsets of Early T-cell Precursor (ETP; immature phenotype) and early T-ALL. Among immature T-ALL, genomic alterations, that cause BCL11B transcriptional deregulation, identify a specific genetic subgroup. Although comprehensive cytogenetic and molecular studies have shed light on the genetic background of T-ALL, biomarkers are not currently adopted in the diagnostic workup of T-ALL, and only a limited number of studies have assessed their clinical implications. In this review, we will focus on recurrent T-ALL abnormalities that define specific leukemogenic pathways and on oncogenes/oncosuppressors that can serve as diagnostic biomarkers. Moreover, we will discuss how the complex genomic profile of T-ALL can be used to address and test innovative/targeted therapeutic options.

TI Microrna-124 targets flotillin-1 to regulate proliferation and migration
   in breast cancer
SO MOLECULAR CANCER
AB Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been documented as playing important roles in cancer development. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-124 in breast cancer and clarified the regulation of flotillin-1 (FLOT1) by miR-124.
   Methods: The expression levels of miR-124 were examined in breast cancer cell lines and patient specimens using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. The clinicopathological significance of the resultant data was later analyzed. Next, we explored the function of miR-124 to determine its potential roles on cancer cell growth and migration in vitro. A luciferase reporter assay was conducted to confirm the target gene of miR-124, and the results were validated in cell lines and patient specimens.
   Results: We found that miR-124 expression was significantly downregulated in breast cancer cell lines and patient specimen compared with normal cell lines and paired adjacent normal tissues (P < 0.0001), respectively. MiR-124 was also associated with tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage (P = 0.0007) and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.0004). In breast cancer cell lines, the ectopic expression of miR-124 inhibited cell growth and migration in vitro. Moreover, we identified the FLOT1 gene as a novel direct target of miR-124, and miR-124 ectopic expression significantly inhibited FLOT1. Luciferase assays confirmed that miR-124 could directly bind to the 3' untranslated region of FLOT1 and suppress translation. Moreover, FLOT1 was widely upregulated, and inversely correlated with miR-124 in breast cancer tissues. Consistent with the effect of miR-124, the knockdown of FLOT1 significantly inhibited breast cancer cell growth and migration. We also observed that the rescue expression of FLOT1 partially restored the effects of miR-124.
   Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that miR-124 might be a tumor suppressor in breast cancer via the regulation of FLOT1. This microRNA could serve as a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for breast cancer.

TI Canopy openness and topographic habitat drive tree seedling recruitment
   after snow damage in an old-growth subtropical forest
SO FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB We investigated the relative and combined effect of topography and light environment on the recruitment of seedlings in a subtropical forest after snow damage to the canopy. The tree seedling community in an old-growth subtropical forest was monitored using 500 2 m x 2 m seedling plots at six-month intervals for 2 years. With a focus on recruitment following canopy damage, we related abiotic and biotic environmental variables to seedling dynamics, and we tested if significant topographic and light habitat associations were present for seedlings recruiting via a torus translation test. Then, we used variance partitioning to examine the relative effects of spatial, topographic and light variables on the temporal assemblages of seedlings. A total of 3047 seedlings from 58 species recruited in the first 2 years following snow damage. At the community level, increases in seedling abundance and richness were positively correlated with canopy openness and negatively correlated with elevation. At the species level, both pioneer and late-successional tree species had more recruits in high light environment than in low light environment. 84.3% of the recruiting seedlings were significantly associated to either light environment (35.7%), topography (26.5%) or both (22.1%). Despite this, at the plot level, spatial variables (PCNM) explained the majority of the variability in seedling composition over time. Our results suggest that snow damage to the canopy increases species richness and abundance via light-facilitated seedling recruitment, and that the composition of recruiting seedlings was largely spatially dependent. Topographic habitat filtering acts as a persistent force in determining the recruitment of seedlings and increases in strength with increased light-facilitated seedling recruitment. Our results highlight that, in this subtropical forest, both light requirement and topographic specialization interact over time to play a key role in promoting coexistence of tree species through selection of individuals at the seedling stage. We also suggest exploring the possibilities of management intervention to speed up the recovery of this forest.

TI Identification and Characterization of MicroRNAs Involving in Initial
   Sex Differentiation of Chlamys farreri Gonads
SO BIOLOGY-BASEL
AB Simple Summary Sex formation of gonads encompasses two ancient and highly conserved biological processes, sex determination and sex differentiation. The processes are strictly regulated by a complex of gene networks. There is increasing evidence that miRNAs play key roles in many biological processes. however, information is limited in their contribution to sex differentiation in animals. In the present study, we identified the novel miRNAs involved in sex-related genes regulation and explored the miRNA-mRNA networks underlying the posttranscriptional regulation during the initial sex differentiation in Zhikong scallop, Chlamys farreri. Our findings provide an important basis for studying the sex differentiation mechanisms, as well as developing sex control techniques in bivalves. Research on expressional regulation of genes at the initial sex differentiation of gonads will help to elucidate the mechanisms of sex determination and differentiation in animals. However, information on initial sex differentiation of gonads is limited in bivalves. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous small noncoding RNAs that can regulate the target gene expression at the posttranscription level by degrading the mRNA or repressing the mRNA translation. In the present study, we investigated the small RNAs transcriptome using the testes and ovaries of Zhikong scallop Chlamys farreri juveniles with a shell height of 5.0 mm, a critical stage of initial sex differentiation of gonads. A total of 75 known mature miRNAs and 103 novel miRNAs were identified. By comparing the expression of miRNAs between the ovary and testis, 11 miRNAs were determined to be differentially expressed. GO annotations and KEGG analyses indicated that many putative target genes that matched to these differentially expressed miRNAs participated in the regulation of sex differentiation. Furthermore, two selected miRNAs, cfa-novel_miR65 and cfa-miR-87a-3p_1, were confirmed to downregulate expressions of Foxl2 (a female-critical gene) and Klf4 (a male-critical gene), respectively, using a dual-luciferase reporter analysis. Our findings provided new insights into the initial sex differentiation of gonads regulated by miRNAs in bivalves.

TI The Wnt non-canonical signaling modulates cabazitaxel sensitivity in
   prostate cancer cells
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background
   Despite new drugs, metastatic prostate cancer remains fatal. Growing interest in the latest approved cabazitaxel taxane drug has markedly increased due to the survival benefits conferred when used at an earlier stage of the disease, its promising new therapeutic combination and formulation, and its differential toxicity. Still cabazitaxel's mechanisms of resistance are poorly characterized. The goal of this study was thus to generate a new model of acquired resistance against cabazitaxel in order to unravel cabazitaxel's resistance mechanisms.
   Methods
   Du145 cells were cultured with increasing concentrations of cabazitaxel, docetaxel/ taxane control or placebo/age-matched control. Once resistance was reached, Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Translation (EMT) was tested by cell morphology, cell migration, and E/M markers expression profile. Cell transcriptomics were determined by RNA sequencing; related pathways were identified using IPA, PANTHER or KEGG software. The Wnt pathway was analyzed by western blotting, pharmacological and knock-down studies.
   Results
   While age-matched Du145 cells were sensitive to both taxane drugs, docetaxel-resistant cells were only resistant to docetaxel and cabazitaxel-resistant cells showed a partial crossresistance to both drugs concomitant to EMT. Using RNA-sequencing, the Wnt non-canonical pathway was identified as exclusively activated in cabazitaxel resistant cells while the Wnt canonical pathway was restricted to docetaxel-resistant cells. Cabazitaxel-resistant cells showed a minimal crossover in the Wnt-pathway-related genes linked to docetaxel resistance validating our unique model of acquired resistance to cabazitaxel. Pharmacological and western blot studies confirmed these findings and suggest the implication of the Tyrosine kinase Ror2 receptor in cabazitaxel resistant cells. Variation in Ror2 expression level altered the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to both drugs identifying a possible new target for taxane resistance.
   Conclusion
   Our study represents the first demonstration that while Wnt pathway seems to play an important role in taxanes resistance, Wnt effectors responsible for taxane specificity remain un-identified prompting the need for more studies.

TI In transition with ADHD: the role of information, in facilitating or
   impeding young people's transition into adult services
SO BMC PSYCHIATRY
AB Background: Many national and regional clinical guidelines emphasise the need for good communication of information to young people and their parent/carers about what to expect during transition into adult services. Recent research indicates only a minority of young people in need of transition for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) experience continuity of care into adulthood, with additional concerns about quality of transition. This qualitative study explored the role that information plays in experiences of transition from the perspectives of parent/carers and young people.
   Methods: Participants were recruited from 10 National Health Service Trusts, located across England, with varying service configurations. Ninety two qualitative interviews were conducted: 64 with young people with ADHD at different stages relative to transition, and 28 with parent/carers. Thematic analysis of data was completed using the Framework Method.
   Results: Interviewees reported a range of experiences; however reliance on parent/carers to gather and translate key information, and negative experiences associated with poor communication of information, were universal. Three themes emerged: Navigating information with help from parents; Information on ADHD into adulthood; Information about the transition process. The first revealed the essential role of parent in the translation and application of information, the other two explored distinct types of information necessary for a smooth transition. Interviewees made recommendations for clinical practice similar to UK (United Kingdom) National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, with an additional emphasis on providing nuanced information on ADHD as a potentially long term condition. It was important to interviewees that General Practitioners had a basic understanding of adult ADHD and also had access to information about service provision.
   Conclusions: Our findings illustrate that the availability and communication of information to young people and their parent/carers is an essential component of the transition process between child and adult ADHD services. How and when it is provided may support or impede transition. This study constitutes a substantial contribution to the evidence base, drawing on interviews from a range of participants across England and from Trusts offering different types of services.

TI Suitability of Yin Yang 1 transcript and protein levels for biomarker
   studies in B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma
SO BIOMARKER RESEARCH
AB Background: Yin Yang 1 (YY1) is a transcription factor that plays an important role during all stages of B cell differentiation. Several studies reported upregulation of YY1 in B cell derived lymphoma, indicating that it might act as an oncogene. Furthermore, aberrant YY1 expression has been associated with survival in some entities of B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), suggesting that YY1 could be a valuable biomarker in B-NHL. However, studies are controversial and methodologically disparate, partially because some studies are based on transcript levels while others rely on YY1 protein data. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the dependence of YY1 protein levels on YY1 transcription.
   Methods: A panel of human cell lines representing different B-NHL subtypes was used to test for the correlation of YY1 mRNA and protein levels which were determined by quantitative PCR and immunoblotting. To analyze YY1 mRNA and YY1 protein stability cells were treated with actinomycin-D and cycloheximide, respectively. siRNAs were transfected to knockdown YY1. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed with data from published patient cohorts. Pearson's correlation analyses were assessed and statistical power was examined by Student's t-test.
   Results: In the analyzed panel of B-NHL cell lines YY1 transcript levels do not correlate with their cellular protein amounts. YY1 protein levels were unaffected by transient block of transcription or by targeting YY1 mRNA using siRNA. Additionally, global inhibition of translation up to 48 h did not alter protein levels of YY1, indicating that YY1 is a highly stable protein in B-NHL. Furthermore, in a retrospective analysis of two different B-NHL cohorts, YY1 transcript levels had no impact on patients' survival probabilities.
   Conclusions: Our results point out the necessity to focus on YY1 protein expression to understand the potential role of YY1 as an oncogene and to unravel its suitability as clinical biomarker in B-NHL.

TI Molecular characterization, expression analysis and function
   identification of TNF? in black rockfish (Sebastes schlegelii)
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES
AB TNF alpha, as a pro-inflammatory cytokine, plays an important role in inflammation and immune homeostasis maintaining. However, the knowledge about the immune functions of teleost TNF alpha against bacterial infections is still limited. In this study, the TNF alpha was characterized from black rockfish (Sebastes schlegelii). The bioinformatics analyses showed the evolutionary conservations in sequence and structure. The expression levels of Ss_TNF alpha mRNA were significantly up-regulated in the spleen and intestine after Aeromonas salmonicides and Edwardsiella tarda infections, and dramatically down-regulated in PBLs after LPS and poly I:C stimulations. Meanwhile, the extremely up-regulated expressions of other inflammatory cytokines (especially for IL-1 beta and IL17C) were observed in the intestine and spleen after bacterial infection and down-regulations were obtained in PBLs. The significant regulation with expression patterns of Ss_TNF alpha and other inflammatory cytokine mRNAs illustrated the variations of immunity in different tissues and cells of black rockfish. The regulated functions of Ss_TNF alpha in the up/downstream signaling pathways were preliminarily verified on the transcription and translation levels. Subsequently, in vitro knockdown of Ss_TNF alpha in the intestine cells of black rockfish confirmed the important immune roles of Ss_TNF alpha. Finally, the apoptotic analyses were conducted in PBLs and intestine cells of black rockfish. The rapid increases of the apoptotic rates were obtained in both PBLs and intestine cells after treatment with rSs_TNF alpha, but distinct apoptotic rates at the early and late stages of apoptosis were observed between these two types of cells. The results of apoptotic analyses suggested that Ss_TNF alpha could trigger apoptosis of different cells in different strategies in black rockfish. Overall, the findings in this study indicated the important roles of Ss_TNF alpha in the immune system of black rockfish during pathogenic infection, as well as the potential function on biomarker for monitoring the health status.

TI Diagnostic accuracy and prediction increment of markers of
   epithelial-mesenchymal transition to assess cancer cell detachment from
   primary tumors
SO BMC CANCER
AB Background: Metastases play a role in about 90% of cancer deaths. Markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) measured in primary tumor cancer cells might provide diagnostic information about the likelihood that cancer cells have detached from the primary tumor. Used together with established diagnostic tests of detachment-lymph node evaluation and radiologic imaging-EMT marker measurements might improve the ability of clinicians to assess the patient's risk of metastatic disease. Translation of EMT markers to clinical use has been hampered by a lack of valid analyses of clinically-informative parameters. Here, we demonstrate a rigorous approach to estimating the sensitivity, specificity, and prediction increment of an EMT marker to assess cancer cell detachment from primary tumors.
   Methods: We illustrate the approach using immunohistochemical measurements of the EMT marker E-cadherin in a set of colorectal primary tumors from a population-based prospective cohort in North Carolina. Bayesian latent class analysis was used to estimate sensitivity and specificity in a setting of multiple imperfect diagnostic tests and no gold standard. Risk reclassification analysis was used to assess the extent to which addition of the marker to the panel of established diagnostic tests would improve mortality prediction. We explored how changing the latent class conditional dependence assumptions and definition of marker positivity would impact the results.
   Results: All diagnostic accuracy and prediction increment statistics varied with the choice of cut point to define marker positivity. When comparing different definitions of marker positivity to each other, numerous trade-offs were observed in terms of sensitivity, specificity, predictive discrimination, and prediction model calibration. We then discussed several implementation considerations and the plausibility of analytic assumptions.
   Conclusions: The approaches presented here can be extended to any EMT marker, to most forms of cancer, and to different kinds of EMT marker measurements, such as RNA or gene methylation data. These methods provide valid, clinically-informative assessment of whether and how to use a given EMT marker to refine tumor staging and consequent treatment decisions.

TI THE DOG, THE KNIGHT, AND THE SQUIRE SIGMUND FREUD'S READING OF CERVANTES
SO OXFORD GERMAN STUDIES
AB The essay describes a stage in Freud's literary education initiated by an early reading of Don Quixote in German translation. Fired by the depth and inventiveness of Cervantes's story-telling and the insight into human character it revealed, Freud conceived a desire to learn something of the language in which it was originally written; and the discovery of an excerpt from Cervantes's Novelas ejemplares in a Spanish reader led him and a schoolfriend to fashion for themselves a home-made Spanish as a medium for the construction of a private world. Assumption of the persona of Cipion, the dog who conducts a conversation with a fellow-dog in Cervantes's 'Coloquio entre Cipion y Berganza', made possible various kinds of self-image and distancing. Repeated readings of Don Quixote sharpened Freud's appreciation of different kinds of humour, provided dramatic images for himself and his fiancee along with opportunities to indulge his didactic impulses, and helped him portray, through contrast and parallel, characters encountered in his life and his reading. They also strengthened his appreciation of graphic art when he set himself to assess the strengths and weaknesses of Gustave Dore's illustrations. Some of Freud's comments bring into focus his time-conditioned social Preconceptions, especially about the nature and social roles of women. Freud subjects neither Don Quixote nor the 'Coloquio' to the kinds of psychoanalytic analysis he applied to the writings of Conrad Ferdinand Meyer and Wilhelm Jensen; but when his aesthetic delight in Cervantes's art led him into self-definition and character analysis, he took a decisive step towards enlisting literature in the psychoanalytic quest. A concluding summary of the role of Cervantes's writings in Freud's life and thought offers itself as a demonstration of the part literature may play in the lives of sensitive and intelligent people who have not made its aesthetic investigation their principal task.

TI Global Profiling of Lysine Acetylation in Borrelia burgdorferi B31
   Reveals Its Role in Central Metabolism
SO FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB The post-translational modification of proteins has been shown to be extremely important in prokaryotes. Using a highly sensitive mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach, we have characterized the acetylome of B. burgdorferi. As previously reported for other bacteria, a relatively low number (5%) of the potential genome-encoded proteins of B. burgdorferi were acetylated. Of these, the vast majority were involved in central metabolism and cellular information processing (transcription, translation, etc.). Interestingly, these critical cell functions were targeted during both ML (mid-log) and S (stationary) phases of growth. However, acetylation of target proteins in ML phase was limited to single lysine residues while these same proteins were acetylated at multiple sites during S phase. To determine the acetyl donor in B. burgdorferi, we used mutants that targeted the sole acetate metabolic/anabolic pathway in B. burgdorferi (lipid I synthesis). B. burgdorferi strains B31-A3, B31-A3 Delta ackA (acetyl-P- and acetyl-CoA(-)) and B31-A3 Delta ta (acetyl-P+ and acetyl-CoA(-)) were grown to S phase and the acetylation profiles were analyzed. While only two proteins were acetylated in the Delta ackA mutant, 140 proteins were acetylated in the Delta pta mutant suggesting that acetyl-P was the primary acetyl donor in B. burgdorferi. Using specific enzymatic assays, we were able to demonstrate that hyperacetylation of proteins in S phase appeared to play a role in decreasing the enzymatic activity of at least two glycolytic proteins. Currently, we hypothesize that acetylation is used to modulate enzyme activities during different stages of growth. This strategy would allow the bacteria to post-translationally stimulate the activity of key glycolytic enzymes by deacetylation rather than expending excessive energy synthesizing new proteins. This would be an appealing, low-energy strategy for a bacterium with limited metabolic capabilities. Future work focuses on identifying potential protein deacetylase(s) to complete our understanding of this important biological process.

TI Dynamics of epidemiological intelligence for exploitation in effective
   worm management in sheep - A Rajasthan experience
SO INDIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES
AB Being of ubiquitous nature and omnipresence of the gastrointestinal (GI) parasites, their management presents a difficult challenge following wide-spread emergence of anthelmintic resistance. Anthelmintics have a definite role to play in worm management but their frequency of use should be minimised to the extent possible and the available resources of anthelmintics could be used judiciously by exploiting the knowledge of parasite epidemiology. The present communication discusses different aspects of worm biology and their interaction with environment, host and managemental practices. The bioclimatographs suggested existence of suitable conditions for translation of exogenous stages of Haemonchus contortus from late May to late September in semi-arid region and from mid June to late August / September in arid region. Based on real-time observations, different strategies were developed and tested for efficient management of GI nematodes in sheep flocks of Rajasthan. The agro-climatic conditions and lambing pattern do not favour the development of strongyle larvae during December-June, resulting in absence of typical peri-parturient rise in faecal egg counts (FECs). However, the epidemiology of strongyle worms showed the possibility of hypobiosis. An initial rising trend in FECs in June could be probably due to resumption of development of hypobiotic worms within the host, giving peak of infection in July and providing the source of pasture contamination during monsoon. The decline in FECs in the following months may be due to spontaneous occurrence of "self-cure" phenomenon. The GI parasite populations in small ruminants are highly aggregated and over-dispersed, with around 80% of the worms found in only 20-30% of the host. Thus, requirement for treatment is a reflection of the genetic basis of host variation in either innate or acquired resistance to parasites or resilience. The over-dispersion phenomenon was used in the form of targeted selective treatment and for breeding for resistance / resilience to parasites ultimately with the aim to increase the size of refugia, maintain anthelmintic efficacy and cost-effective worm management.

TI Prognostic prediction and gene regulation network of EIF2S2 in
   hepatocellular carcinoma based on data mining
SO JOURNAL OF GASTROINTESTINAL ONCOLOGY
AB Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignant tumor with a high fatality rate, predicting poor prognosis and therapeutic effect. Screening potential prognostic genes in HCC could be a creative way to advance clinical treatment. Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit beta (EIF2S2) has reportedly been linked to several tumors, including liver cancer, but the prognostic predictions remain unknown. Therefore, we aimed to clarify the prognostic role and interaction network of EIF2S2 in HCC using bioinformatics data. Methods: We screened EIF2S2 using the Oncomine, Ualcan, and TCGA databases. R software was used to analyze the mRNA level and clinicopathological characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma. Evaluation of the correlations between EIF2S2 and patients' survival was made using the Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression model. Then, the influence of EIF2S2 gene mutations on the prognosis of patients was explored by cBioPortal. The protein-protein interaction network of 50 similar genes related to EIF2S2 was implemented by GEPIA2 and Metascape. The LinkedOmics database allowed us to carry out Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. Finally, we constructed the EIF2S2 kinase, miRNA, and transcription factor target networks using GeneMANIA. Results: EIF2S2 mRNA was overexpressed in HCC and was closely associated with clinicopathological features, including gender, age, race, tumor grade, and stage. There was no correlation between EIF2S2 genetic mutations and prognostic survival. Combining Cox proportional hazards regression model analyses, high-expressed EIF2S2 predicted poor prognosis in HCC patients. Additionally, we screened the top three EIF2S2-related genes (PFDN4, HM13, and SNRPD1), the 50 similar genes, and then constructed a 50-similar-gene protein-protein interaction network identified by the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways using Metascape. EIF2S2 target networks in HCC were identified in kinase, miRNA, and transcription factor networks, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1), miRNAs (Mir-144), and transcription factors (GGAANCGGAANY_UNKNOWN) using GeneMANIA. Conclusions: EIF2S2 plays a crucial role in the gene-regulating network of HCC and may be a potential prognostic marker or therapeutic target for HCC patients.

TI In vivo compaction dynamics of bacterial DNA: A fingerprint of DNA/RNA
   demixing?
SO CURRENT OPINION IN COLLOID & INTERFACE SCIENCE
AB The volume occupied by unconstrained bacterial DNA in physiological saline solutions exceeds 1000 times the volume of the cell. Still, it is confined to a well defined region of the cell called the nucleoid, which occupies only a fraction of the cell volume. This is puzzling, because bacterial DNA is not delimited by a membrane, in sharp contrast with the nucleus of eukaryotic cells: There is still no general agreement on the mechanism leading to the compaction of the DNA and the formation of the nucleoid. However, advances in in vivo sub-wavelength resolution microscopy techniques have recently allowed the observation of the nucleoid at an unprecedented level of detail. In particular, these observations show that the compaction of the nucleoid is not static but is instead a highly dynamic feature, which depends on several factors, like the richness of the nutrient, the cell cycle stage, temperature, and the action of an osmotic shock or antibiotics. After a short description of the electrolyte content of the cytosol and a brief overview of the different mechanisms that may lead to the formation of the nucleoid, this paper reviews some of the most fascinating recent results of in vivo sub-wavelength resolution microscopy. It is furthermore argued that these observations provide converging indications in favor of a model that describes the cytosol as an aqueous electrolyte solution containing several macromolecular species, where demixing and segregative phase separation occur between DNA and RNA (essentially rRNA and mRNA involved in translation complexes, but also the large amounts of rRNA synthesized at the rrn operons of cells growing in rich media). It is also pointed out that crowding may play a crucial role through its synergy with electrostatic forces. By constraining macromolecules to remain at short distances from one another and feel electrostatic interactions in spite of the strong screening exerted by electrolyte species, crowding favors stronger DNA/RNA demixing and nucleoid compaction.

TI Exosomal circSHKBP1 promotes gastric cancer progression via regulating
   the miR-582-3p/HUR/VEGF axis and suppressing HSP90 degradation
SO MOLECULAR CANCER
AB Background Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important regulatory roles in the development of various cancers. However, biological functions and the underlying molecular mechanism of circRNAs in gastric cancer (GC) remain obscure. Methods Differentially expressed circRNAs were identified by RNA sequencing. The biological functions of circSHKBP1 in GC were investigated by a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. The expression of circSHKBP1 was evaluated using quantitative real-time PCR and RNA in situ hybridization, and the molecular mechanism of circSHKBP1 was demonstrated by western blot, RNA pulldown, RNA immunoprecipitation, luciferase assays and rescue experiments. Lastly, mouse xenograft and bioluminescence imaging were used to exam the clinical relevance of circSHKBP1 in vivo. Results Increased expression of circSHKBP1(hsa_circ_0000936) was revealed in GC tissues and serum and was related to advanced TNM stage and poor survival. The level of exosomal circSHKBP1 significantly decreased after gastrectomy. Overexpression of circSHKBP1 promoted GC cell proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo, while suppression of circSHKBP1 plays the opposite role. Exosomes with upregulated circSHKBP1 promoted cocultured cells growth. Mechanistically, circSHKBP1 sponged miR-582-3p to increase HUR expression, enhancing VEGF mRNA stability. Moreover, circSHKBP1 directly bound to HSP90 and obstructed the interaction of STUB1 with HSP90, inhibiting the ubiquitination of HSP90, resulting in accelerated GC development in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate that exosomal circSHKBP1 regulates the miR-582-3p/HUR/VEGF pathway, suppresses HSP90 degradation, and promotes GC progression. circSHKBP1 is a promising circulating biomarker for GC diagnosis and prognosis and an exceptional candidate for further therapeutic exploration.

TI A JAPANESE INSPIRATION FOR THE CHINESE PROGRESS TOWARDS NEW MUSIC
SO HUDEBNI VEDA
AB In the nineteenth century, both China and Japan came to adopt certain elements of Western culture. After a long period of Japan's obtaining information about the Western world mainly through Chinese mediation, the situation changed at the end of the nineteenth century.
   In the process of modernization of Chinese music, the Japanese model played a central role, not only during the early stages of New Music (music combining Chinese and European traditions), but also still during the first half of the twentieth century. By the end of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912), the new Chinese system of music education, based on the Japanese system, came to be one of the principal channels for China's acquaintance with Western music.
   Beyond that, Japanese contribution to the emergence of modern Chinese music was likewise made possible by translations of Japanese treatises on Western music theory, and by opening residences for Chinese students at Japanese schools. Also instrumental in acquainting China with modern European musical movements, including notably Impressionism, were Japanese composers.
   The main subject of this article is the nature of the reception of the elements of Japanese modernization, and the reasons behind the increased popularity of the individual modernization approaches in China. Particular attention is paid to institutional changes in music education, the genre of school songs, and the earliest theoretical writings on music by Chinese authors based on Japanese models in different historical periods. While Zeng Zhimin embodies the so-called "Golden Era" of Sino-Japanese relations after 1900, the New Culture Movement is represented by music theorist Feng Zikai. The composer Jiang Wenye is a leading exponent of the music scene during the Japanese occupation of China.
   Despite the obvious similarity of modernization processes in the two countries, the theoretical approaches to the reception of Western music, as well as actual works produced by Japanese and Chinese composers differ, due notably to different attitudes towards their domestic musical traditions.

TI Medium and mediality in Anne Carson
SO TEXTUAL PRACTICE
AB Anne Carson's recent work has experimented with intermedia composition, leaving behind what one reviewer calls `the medium of the ordinary book'. While her critical reception often considers these experiments in relation to new media, I argue that we understand Carson in the context of a reflection on the concept of medium as such. This kind of reflection on medium is evident both in contemporary poetic experiment and recent work in poetics which consider medium as the locus of historical practice. By articulating the constraints of her linguistic medium Carson introduces difference in her work. Medium emerges as a hybrid concept, encompassing apparatuses of mediation; conventions; and the mediality or impart-ability (Benjamin) of language as a social practice. The article charts these aspects of medium in Nox and Autobiography of Red, focusing on medium as a physical substrate, ekphrasis and translation, recurring elements in Carson's work concerned with mediality: the means of representation, address, figuration and communication. I conclude by suggesting that through these engagements with medium the historical nature of the work emerges, and, consequently, its means of differing from the present; this represents a resource against what Rosalind Krauss calls `the deadening embrace of the general' in contemporary art.

TI Mapping human serum-induced gene networks as a basis for the creation of
   biomimetic periosteum for bone repair
SO CYTOTHERAPY
AB Background: The periosteum is a highly vascularized, collagen-rich tissue that plays a crucial role in directing bone repair. This is orchestrated primarily by its resident progenitor cell population. Indeed, preservation of periosteum integrity is critical for bone healing. Cells extracted from the periosteum retain their osteochondrogenic properties and as such are a promising basis for tissue engineering strategies for the repair of bone defects. However, the culture expansion conditions and the way in which the cells are reintroduced to the defect site are critical aspects of successful translation. Indeed, expansion in human serum and implantation on biomimetic materials has previously been shown to improve in vivo bone formation.
   Aim: This study aimed to develop a protocol to allow for the expansion of human periosteum derived cells (hPDCs) in a biomimetic periosteal-like environment.
   Methods: The expansion conditions were defined through the investigation of the bioactive cues involved in augmenting hPDC proliferative and multipotency characteristics, based on transcriptomic analysis of cells cultured in human serum.
   Results: Master regulators of transcriptional networks were identified, and an optimized periosteum-derived growth factor cocktail (PD-GFC; containing beta-estradiol, FGF2, TNF alpha, TGF beta, IGF-1 and PDGF-BB) was generated. Expansion of hPDCs in PD-GFC resulted in serum mimicry with regard to the cell morphology, proliferative capacity and chondrogenic differentiation. When incorporated into a three-dimensional collagen type 1 matrix and cultured in PD-GFC, the hPDCs migrated to the surface that represented the matrix topography of the periosteum cambium layer. Furthermore, gene expression analysis revealed a down-regulated WNT and TGF beta signature and an up-regulation of CREB, which may indicate the hPDCs are recreating their progenitor cell signature.
   Conclusion: This study highlights the first stage in the development of a biomimetic periosteum, which may have applications in bone repair. (C) 2020 International Society for Cell and Gene Therapy. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Functional and molecular characterization of the conserved Arabidopsis
   PUMILIO protein, APUM9
SO PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB Key message Here we demonstrate that the APUM9 RNA-binding protein and its co-factors play a role in mRNA destabilization and how this activity might regulate early plant development.Abstract APUM9 is a conserved PUF RNA-binding protein (RBP) under complex transcriptional control mediated by a transposable element (TE) that restricts its expression in Arabidopsis. Currently, little is known about the functional and mechanistic details of the plant PUF regulatory system and the biological relevance of the TE-mediated repression of APUM9 in plant development and stress responses. By combining a range of transient assays, we show here, that APUM9 binding to target transcripts can trigger their rapid decay via its conserved C-terminal RNA-binding domain. APUM9 directly interacts with DCP2, the catalytic subunit of the decapping complex and DCP2 overexpression induces rapid decay of APUM9 targeted mRNAs. We show that APUM9 negatively regulates the expression of ABA signaling genes during seed imbibition, and thereby might contribute to the switch from dormant stage to seed germination. By contrast, strong TE-mediated repression of APUM9 is important for normal plant growth in the later developmental stages. Finally, APUM9 overexpression plants show slightly enhanced heat tolerance suggesting that TE-mediated control of APUM9, might have a role not only in embryonic development, but also in plant adaptation to heat stress conditions.

TI Indigenising the screen: Te Tangata Whai Rawa o Weniti-The Maori
   Merchant of Venice (2002)
SO ALTERNATIVE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES
AB This article examines Te Tangata Whai Rawa o Weniti-The Maori Merchant of Venice (2002), the first dramatic feature film, performed entirely in te reo Maori (the Maori language). This adaptation of Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice was based on Pei Te Hurinui Jones' 1946 te reo Maori translation. Alongside close readings of the film, I drew on an interview with director, Don Selwyn, whanau (family) input and the literature. I applied Kia Manawanui: Kaupapa Maori Film Theoretical Framework, an analytical tool, to provide thematic structure. Don Selwyn's interpretation disrupts hierarchies of language, validating not only the Maori language but Indigenous languages globally as eminently capable of cinematic expression. He draws out the dynamics of oppression and colonisation, providing transformative and disruptive images of Maori, Maori culture and tikanga (protocols). By expressing these features Don Selwyn successfully indigenizes the screen. I argue that the film is a taonga (treasure).

TI Control of maternal mRNA stability in germ cells and early embryos
SO BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-GENE REGULATORY MECHANISMS
AB mRNA regulation is essential in germ cells and early embryos. In particular, late oogenesis and early embryogenesis occur in the absence of transcription and rely on maternal mRNAs stored in oocytes. These maternal mRNAs subsequently undergo a general decay in embryos during the maternal-to-zygotic transition in which the control of development switches from the maternal to the zygotic genome. Regulation of mRNA stability thus plays a key role during these early stages of development and is tightly interconnected with translational regulation and mRNA localization. A common mechanism in these three types of regulation implicates variations in mRNA poly(A) tail length. Recent advances in the control of mRNA stability include the widespread and essential role of regulated deadenylation in early developmental processes, as well as the mechanisms regulating mRNA stability which involve RNA binding proteins, microRNAs and interplay between the two. Also emerging are the roles that other classes of small non-coding RNAs, endo-siRNAs and piRNAs play in the control of mRNA decay, including connections between the regulation of transposable elements and cellular mRNA regulation through the piRNA pathway.

TI Effects of Spatial Expression of Activating Transcription Factor 4 on
   the Pathogenicity of Two Phenotypes of Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus by
   Regulating the Endoplasmic Reticulum-Mediated Autophagy Process
SO MICROBIOLOGY SPECTRUM
AB The ER-tropic viruses hijack the host cellular ER as the replication platform of the life cycle, which can lead to strong ER stress. The UPR and related transcriptional cascades triggered by ER stress play a crucial role in viral replication and pathogenesis, but little is known about these underlying mechanisms.
   The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response is a highly conserved stress-defense mechanism and activates the adaptive unfolded protein response (UPR) to mitigate imbalance. The ER stress-activated signaling pathways can also trigger autophagy to facilitate cellular repair. Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) utilizes the host cellular ER as the primary site of the life cycle. However, the interplay between cellular ER stress and BVDV replication remains unclear. This report reveals that cytopathic (cp) and noncytopathic (ncp) BVDV have distinct strategies to regulate UPR mechanisms and ER stress-mediated autophagy for their own benefit. Immunoblot analysis revealed that cp and ncp BVDV differentially regulated the abundance of ER chaperone GRP78 for viral replication, while the protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK)-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit alpha (eIF2 alpha)-activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) pathway of the UPR was switched on at different stages of infection. Pretreatment with ER stress inducer promoted virion replication, but RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown of ATF4 in BVDV-infected cells significantly attenuated BVDV infectivity titers. More importantly, the effector ATF4 activated by cp BVDV infection translocated into the nucleus to mediate autophagy, but ATF4 was retained in the cytoplasm during ncp BVDV infection. In addition, we found that cp BVDV core protein was localized in the ER to induce ER stress-mediated autophagy. Overall, the potential therapeutic target ATF4 may contribute to the global eradication campaign of BVDV.IMPORTANCE The ER-tropic viruses hijack the host cellular ER as the replication platform of the life cycle, which can lead to strong ER stress. The UPR and related transcriptional cascades triggered by ER stress play a crucial role in viral replication and pathogenesis, but little is known about these underlying mechanisms. Here, we report that cytopathic and noncytopathic BVDV use different strategies to reprogram the cellular UPR and ER stress-mediated autophagy for their own advantage. The cytopathic BVDV unconventionally downregulated the expression level of GRP78, creating perfect conditions for self-replication via the UPR, and the noncytopathic BVDV retained ATF4 in the cytoplasm to provide an advantage for its persistent infection. Our findings provide new insights into exploring how BVDV and other ER-tropic viruses reprogram the UPR signaling pathway in the host cells for replication and reveal the attractive host target ATF4 for new antiviral agents.

TI "Lorenz Sterne' among German philosophers: reception and influence
SO TEXTUAL PRACTICE
AB Laurence Sterne has been read and enjoyed in the German-speaking world since his own lifetime, in excellent German translations by Johann Joachim Christoph Bode and others. His importance to the development of the German novel has been the focus of a number of studies, but his attractiveness to German-language philosophers has been much less noted. In a chronological survey from the late eighteenth to the late twentieth centuries, this article begins with the role Sterne reception plays in the German cult of sensibility (Empfindsamkeit) before focusing in turn on Hegel, Schopenhauer, Marx, Nietzsche, Benjamin, Wittgenstein, Lukacs and Luhmann. Superior philosophical stylists such as Schopenhauer, Marx, Nietzsche and the early Lukacs succumbed to the temptation to imitate surface features of Sterne's style, but the most interesting cases arise when philosophers have spent time reflecting on Sterne's thematic concerns as well as his formal innovations. There have been three main areas of interest: Sterne's characterisations and the question of peculiar individuality, Sterne as a sentimentalist and moralist, and Shandyan humour'. An attempt is made to distinguish between philosophers (such as Wittgenstein) who merely enjoyed reading Sterne, and those (such as Marx, Nietzsche and Luhmann) who can be described as more properly Sternean'.

TI Using SILAC proteomics to investigate the effect of the mycotoxin,
   alternariol, in the human H295R steroidogenesis model
SO CELL BIOLOGY AND TOXICOLOGY
AB The mycotoxin alternariol (AOH) is an important contaminant of fruits and cereal products. The current study sought to address the effect of a non-toxic AOH concentration on the proteome of the steroidogenic H295R cell model. Quantitative proteomics based on stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) coupled to 1D-SDS-PAGE-LC-MS/MS was applied to subcellular-enriched protein samples. Gene ontology (GO) and ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) were further carried out for functional annotation and identification of protein interaction networks. Furthermore, the effect of AOH on apoptosis and cell cycle distribution was also determined by the use of flow cytometry analysis. This work identified 22 proteins that were regulated significantly. The regulated proteins are those involved in early stages of steroid biosynthesis (SOAT1, NPC1, and ACBD5) and C21-steroid hormone metabolism (CYP21A2 and HSD3B1). In addition, several proteins known to play a role in cellular assembly, organization, protein synthesis, and cell cycle were regulated. These findings provide a new framework for studying the mechanisms by which AOH modulates steroidogenesis in H295R cell model.

TI Cartridge case image matching using effective correlation area based
   method
SO FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL
AB A firearm leaves a unique impression on fired cartridge cases. The cross-correlation function plays an important role in matching the characteristic features on the cartridge case found at the crime scene with a specific firearm, for accurate firearm identification. This paper proposes that the computational forensic techniques of alignment and effective correlation area-based approaches to image matching are essential to firearm identification. Specifically, the reference and the corresponding cartridge cases are aligned according to the phase-correlation criterion on the transform domain. The informative segments of the breech face marks are identified by a cross-covariance coefficient using the coefficient value in a window located locally in the image space. The segments are then passed to the measurement of edge density for computing effective correlation areas. Experimental results on a new dataset show that the correlation system can make use of the best properties of alignment and effective correlation area-based approaches, and can attain significant improvement of image-correlation results, compared with the traditional image-matching methods for firearm identification, which employ cartridge-case samples. An analysis of image-alignment score matrices suggests that all translation and scaling parameters are estimated correctly, and contribute to the successful extraction of effective correlation areas. It was found that the proposed method has a high discriminant power, compared with the conventional correlator. This paper advocates that this method will enable forensic science to compile a large-scale image database to perform correlation of cartridge case bases, in order to identify firearms that involve pairwise alignments and comparisons.

TI The DEAD Box Protein Mrh4 Functions in the Assembly of the Mitochondrial
   Large Ribosomal Subunit
SO CELL METABOLISM
AB Proteins in a cell are universally synthesized by ribosomes. Mitochondria contain their own ribosomes, which specialize in the synthesis of a handful of proteins required for oxidative phosphorylation. The pathway of mitoribosomal biogenesis and factors involved are poorly characterized. An example is the DEAD box proteins, widely known to participate in the biogenesis of bacterial and cytoplasmic eukaryotic ribosomes as either RNA helicases or RNA chaperones, whose mitochondrial counterparts remain completely unknown. Here, we have identified the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial DEAD box protein Mrh4 as essential for large mitoribosome subunit biogenesis. Mrh4 interacts with the 21S rRNA, mitoribosome subassemblies, and fully assembled mitoribosomes. In the absence of Mrh4, the 21S rRNA is matured and forms part of a large on-pathway assembly intermediate missing proteins Mrpl16 and Mrpl39. We conclude that Mrh4 plays an essential role during the late stages of mitoribosome assembly by promoting remodeling of the 21S rRNA-protein interactions.

TI Exploring targets of TET2-mediated methylation reprogramming as
   potential discriminators of prostate cancer progression
SO CLINICAL EPIGENETICS
AB BackgroundGlobal DNA methylation alterations are hallmarks of cancer. The tumor-suppressive TET enzymes, which are involved in DNA demethylation, are decreased in prostate cancer (PCa); in particular, TET2 is specifically targeted by androgen-dependent mechanisms of repression in PCa and may play a central role in carcinogenesis. Thus, the identification of key genes targeted by TET2 dysregulation may provide further insight into cancer biology.ResultsUsing a CRISPR/Cas9-derived TET2-knockout prostate cell line, and through whole-transcriptome and whole-methylome sequencing, we identified seven candidate genesASB2, ETNK2, MEIS2, NRG1, NTN1, NUDT10, and SRPXexhibiting reduced expression and increased promoter methylation, a pattern characteristic of tumor suppressors. Decreased expression of these genes significantly discriminates between recurrent and non-recurrent prostate tumors from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort (n=423), and ASB2, NUDT10, and SRPX were significantly correlated with lower recurrence-free survival in patients by Kaplan-Meier analysis. ASB2, MEIS2, and SRPX also showed significantly lower expression in high-risk Gleason score 8 tumors as compared to low or intermediate risk tumors, suggesting that these genes may be particularly useful as indicators of PCa progression. Furthermore, methylation array probes in the TCGA dataset, which were proximal to the highly conserved, differentially methylated sites identified in our TET2-knockout cells, were able to significantly distinguish between matched prostate tumor and normal prostate tissues (n=50 pairs). Except ASB2, all genes exhibited significantly increased methylation at these probes, and methylation status of at least one probe for each of these genes showed association with measures of PCa progression such as recurrence, stage, or Gleason score. Since ASB2 did not have any probes within the TET2-knockout differentially methylated region, we validated ASB2 methylation in an independent series of matched tumor-normal samples (n=19) by methylation-specific qPCR, which revealed concordant and significant increases in promoter methylation within the TET2-knockout site.ConclusionsOur study identifies seven genes governed by TET2 loss in PCa which exhibit an association between their methylation and expression status and measures of PCa progression. As differential methylation profiles and TET2 expression are associated with advanced PCa, further investigation of these specialized TET2 targets may provide important insights into patterns of carcinogenic gene dysregulation.

TI How do MNCs translate corporate talent management strategies into their
   subsidiaries? Evidence from MNCs in Thailand
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND STRATEGY
AB Purpose- This paper aims to contribute to the literature on global talent management by examining how multinational corporations (MNCs) from developed and emerging economies manage talented employees in other emerging economies. Specifically, it aims to understand why MNCs from developed economies are likely to face lower levels of challenge than MNCs from emerging economies when translating corporate-level talent management strategies to their subsidiaries located in emerging economies and how local contextual factors influence the translation processes.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper undertakes a matched-case comparison of two MNCs, one from a developed economy and the other from an emerging economy, that operate in the emerging economy of Thailand. Evidence was obtained from semi-structured interviews field visits and a review of archival documents and Web resources.
   Findings - Based on the obtained evidence, this paper proposes that MNCs from developed economies tend to face challenges in terms of skill shortages, and these challenges affect their translation of talent management strategies to the subsidiary level. By contrast, MNCs from emerging economies tend to face challenges in terms of both skill shortages and the liability of origin (LOR) (i.e. weak employer branding) in the translation process. Both groups of MNCs are likely to develop talent management practices at the subsidiary level to address the challenge of successfully competing in the context of emerging economies.
   Research limitations/implications - One limitation of this research is its methodology. Because this research is based on a matched-case comparison of an MNC from a developed economy and an MNC from an emerging economy, both of which operate in the emerging economy of Thailand, it does not claim generalizability to all MNCs and to other emerging economies. Rather, the results of this research should lead to further discussion of how MNCs from developed and emerging economies translate corporate-level talent management strategies into subsidiary-level practices to survive in other emerging economies. However, one important issue here is that there may be a tension between the use of expatriates and local top managers at MNCs' subsidiaries located in other emerging economies as drivers for knowledge sourcing in that the importance of expatriates may diminish over time as the subsidiaries located in those economies age (Dahms, 2019). In this regard, future research in the area of global talent management should pay special attention to this issue. The other important issue here is that it is possible that the two case study MNCs are very different from one another because of their organizational development stage, history and current globalization stage. Thus, this issue may also influence the types of talent management strategies and practices that the two case study MNCs have developed in different countries. In particular, MNCs from emerging economies (ICBC) may not have developed their global HR strategies, as they have not yet operated globally as in the case of MNCs from developed economies (Citibank). This can be another important issue for future research. Additionally, both MNCs examined in this research operate in the banking industry. This study, therefore, omits MNCs that operate in other industries such as the automobile industry and the hotel and resort industry. Future researchers can explore how both groups of MNCs in other industries translate their talent management strategies into practices when they operate in other emerging economies. Moreover, this study focuses only on two primary contextual factors, the skill-shortage problem and LOR; future research can explore other local contextual factors, such as the national culture, and their impact on the translation of talent management strategies into practices. Furthermore, quantitative studies that use large sample sizes of both groups of MNCs across industries might be useful in deepening our understanding of talent management. Finally, a comparison of talent management strategies and practices between Japanese MNCs and European MNCs that operate in Thailand would also be interesting.
   Practical implications The HR professionals and managers of MNCs that operate in emerging economies or of companies that aim to internationalize their business to emerging economies must pay attention to local institutional structures, including national skill formation systems, to successfully implement talent management practices in emerging economies. Additionally, in the case of MNCs from emerging economies, HR professionals and managers must understand the concept of LOR and look for ways to alleviate this problem to ensure the success of talent management in both developed economies and other emerging economies.
   Social implications This paper provides policy implications for the government in Thailand and in other emerging economies where the skill-shortage problem is particularly severe. Specifically, these governments should pay attention to solving the problem of occupation-level skill shortages to alleviate the severe competition for talented candidates among firms in the labor market.
   Originality/value This paper contributes to the prior literature on talent management in several ways. First, this paper is among the first empirical, qualitative papers that aim to extend the literature on global talent management by focusing on how MNCs from different groups of countries (i.e. developed economies and emerging economies) manage talented employees in the emerging economy of Thailand. Second, this paper demonstrates that the institutional structures of emerging economies play an important role in shaping the talent management practices adopted by the subsidiaries of MNCs that operate in these countries. In this regard, comparative institutionalism theory helps explain the importance of recognizing institutional structures in emerging economies for the purpose of developing effective talent management practices. Finally, there is scarce research on talent management in the underresearched country of Thailand. This study should, therefore, assist managers who wish to implement corporate-to-subsidiary translation strategies in Thailand and other emerging economies.

TI Common genetic variants in pre-microRNAs are associated with cervical
   cancer susceptibility in southern Chinese women
SO JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB Cervical cancer is a commonly diagnosed cancer among females. Polymorphisms in pre-microRNAs have been demonstrated to play critical roles in cancer. However, the roles of pre-microRNA polymorphisms in the aetiology of cervical cancer have not been well documented. We genotyped eight pre-microRNA polymorphisms in 290 cervical cancer patients and 445 cancer-free female controls using quantitative polymerase chain reaction with TaqMan probes. To estimate the association between pre-microRNA polymorphisms and the risk of cervical cancer, an unconditional logistic regression model was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI), adjusting for age, menopause, delivery, and abortion. We found that the pre-miR-137 rs1625579 T > G polymorphism was associated with a significant decrease in cervical cancer risk (TG/GG versus TT: adjusted OR (AOR) = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.27-0.81; TG versus TT: AOR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.34-0.91). We also observed a significant association between the pre-miR-27a rs895819 T > C polymorphism and decreased cervical cancer risk (TC/CC versus TT: AOR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.44-0.96). Stratified analysis further demonstrated that the pre-miR-137 rs1625579 T > C and pre-miR-27a rs895819 T > C polymorphisms significantly reduced the risk of cervical cancer susceptibility in patients younger than 49 years, those who experienced fewer abortions, and clinical stage I patients. Moreover, the pre-miR-137 rs1625579 T > G polymorphism showed protective effects in premenopausal women, squamous cell carcinoma patients, and patients with unclassified types of pathologies; the pre-miR-27a rs895819 T > C polymorphism was also associated with a decreased risk in patients older than 49 years, menopausal women, and women who had experienced vaginal pregnancies. The pre-miR-137 rs1625579 T > G and pre-miR-27a rs895819 T > C polymorphisms may provide protective effects against susceptibility to cervical cancer risk.

TI Revisiting the Classics and the New Media Environments: Shakespeare
   Re-Told by Jeanette Winterson, Margaret Atwood and Edward St. Aubyn
SO MULTICULTURAL SHAKESPEARE-TRANSLATION APPROPRIATION AND PERFORMANCE
AB The versatility of the appropriation of Shakespeare in recent years has been witnessed in a variety of registers and media, which range from special effects on the stage, music, cartoons, comics, advertisements, all the way to video games. This contribution looks at some of the novels in the Shakespeare Re-told Hogarth series as effigies of the contemporary process of adapting the Elizabethan plays to the environments in which the potential readers/viewers work, become informed, seek entertainment and adjust themselves culturally, being, ultimately, cognitive schemes which are validated by today's reception processes. The first novel in the series was Jeanette Winterson's Gap of Time (2016), in which the Shakespearean reference to the years that separate the two moments of The Winter's Tale's plot becomes the title of a video game relying mainly on fantasy. Margaret Atwood's Hag-Seed (2016) rewrites The Tempest as a parable of the theatrical performance and its avatars, as undisputable authority, on the one hand, and source of subversiveness, on the other. Dunbar (2018) is Edward St. Aubyn's response to the family saga of King Lear, where kingship, territorial division and military conflict are replaced by modern media wars, and the issues of public exposure in the original text are reinterpreted interpreted by resorting to the impact of the audio-visual on every-day life.

TI Self-assembling functional programmable protein array for studying
   protein-protein interactions in malaria parasites
SO MALARIA JOURNAL
AB Background: Plasmodium vivax is the most widespread malarial species, causing significant morbidity worldwide. Knowledge is limited regarding the molecular mechanism of invasion due to the lack of a continuous in vitro culture system for these species. Since protein-protein and host-cell interactions play an essential role in the microorganism's invasion and replication, elucidating protein function during invasion is critical when developing more effective control methods. Nucleic acid programmable protein array (NAPPA) has thus become a suitable technology for studying protein-protein and host-protein interactions since producing proteins through the in vitro transcription/translation (IVTT) method overcomes most of the drawbacks encountered to date, such as heterologous protein production, stability and purification.
   Results: Twenty P. vivax proteins on merozoite surface or in secretory organelles were selected and successfully cloned using gateway technology. Most constructs were displayed in the array expressed in situ, using the IVTT method. The Pv12 protein was used as bait for evaluating array functionality and co-expressed with P. vivax cDNA display in the array. It was found that Pv12 interacted with Pv41 (as previously described), as well as PvMSP1(42kDa), PvRBP1a, PvMSP8 and PvRAP1.
   Conclusions: NAPPA is a high-performance technique enabling co-expression of bait and query in situ, thereby enabling interactions to be analysed rapidly and reproducibly. It offers a fresh alternative for studying protein-protein and ligand-receptor interactions regarding a parasite which is difficult to cultivate (i.e. P. vivax).

TI Research Paper Retrospective study of gene signatures and prognostic
   value of m6A regulatory factor in non-small cell lung cancer using TCGA
   database and the verification of FTO
SO AGING-US
AB N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most common internal modification in eukaryotic mRNA. However, little is known about its role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this study, a total of 1017 NSCLC patients from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database with copy number variation (CNV) data were included. Log-rank tests and Cox regression model were used for survival analysis. The relationship between m6A regulators and clinicopathological features was evaluated using the chi-square test. The alteration of m6A regulators were related to T stage. Patients with any CNVs of regulators genes had worse overall survival (OS) than those with diploid genes. The deletion of m6A writer genes was an independent risk factor for poor OS, and the effect synergized with that of copy number gain of eraser genes. High expression of Fat mass-and obesity-associated gene (FTO) was associated with KRAS signaling up. Knockdown of FTO increased m6A content and inhibit proliferation of A549 lung cancer cell. Thus, we identified the genetic changes of m6A regulatory factors in NSCLC for the first time and found a significant relationship between these changes and poor clinical characteristics. FTO might play an important role in promoting NSCLC by decreasing m6A level and activating KRAS signaling.

TI Roles of CircRNAs in Autoimmune Diseases
SO FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
AB Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are covalently linked single-stranded RNAs, compared to linear counterparts that are relatively abundant, conserved, stable, and specific. Previously, most studies have revealed that circRNAs function in gene expression processes and participate in the pathogenesis of cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological diseases. With advances in biotechnology, more biological functions of circRNAs have been found in several signaling pathways that are related to tumorigenesis, immunity, and metabolism. Recently, many circRNAs have been reported to be expressed abnormally and play important roles in the progression of autoimmune diseases. Thus, circRNAs may not only serve as potential biomarkers but also act as immune regulators and offer potential opportunities for therapy. This review briefly introduces the properties as well as the functions of circRNAs in different stages of gene expression. In addition, this article summarizes the available knowledge about abnormally expressed circRNAs in different autoimmune diseases and discusses their potential roles in these diseases, which helps us understand their regulatory mechanisms and provides future research perspectives.

TI Protein-coding genes combined with long non-coding RNAs predict
   prognosis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients as a novel
   clinical multi-dimensional signature
SO MOLECULAR BIOSYSTEMS
AB Esophageal carcinoma is one of the most malignant gastrointestinal cancers worldwide, and has a high mortality rate. Both protein-coding genes (PCGs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play an important role in the development of malignant tumors. However, the clinical significance of PCGs combined lncRNAs is yet to be investigated in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Using probe re-annotation, univariable Cox regression and the random survival forest algorithm to identify PCG-lncRNA combinations predictive of the overall survival, we found a signature comprised of three PCGs (ANGPTL7, OBP2A, SLC27A5) and two lncRNAs (RP11-702B10.1, RP11-523H24.3) to have the highest accurate prediction, with an area under ROC curve (AUC) of 0.85 in the training group and 0.63 in the test group, and it was significantly associated with the survival of ESCC patients in the training group (median survival: 32.2 months > 60 months, P < 0.001). The application of the signature to the test group showed similar prognostic values (median survival: 39.3 months vs. > 460 months, P = 0.03). The chi-square test and multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that the three-PCG, two-lncRNA signature was an independent prognostic factor for patients with ESCC. Stratified analysis suggested that the PCG-lncRNA signature combined with the TNM stage could more accurately categorize ESCC patients. Our study suggests that the three-PCG, two-lncRNA signature has clinical significance for the prognosis of patients with ESCC. This signature can serve as a potential auxiliary biomarker of the TNM stage to subdivide ESCC patients more precisely.

TI Phonology by itself: Masked phonological priming effects with and
   without orthographic overlap
SO JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY
AB The activation of the phonological code plays a central role in visual word recognition. However, it is still unclear how this activation is integrated within this mainly bottom-up process. In the present masked priming study we combined Greek and Spanish, two languages with common phonemes and partially overlapping graphemes to investigate this issue. Greek-Spanish bilinguals performed lexical decisions on Greek and Spanish targets, briefly preceded by either phonologically related or orthographically and phonologically related prime words of the nontarget language. Results revealed significant bidirectional cross-script masked phonological priming effects which disappeared under the influence of nearly overlapping orthographic representations. This pattern of effects suggests that there is fast and automatic language nonselective activation of the phonological code during the initial stages of visual word recognition but that this is clearly dependent on the orthographic properties of the input stimulus. The implications of our findings are discussed within the framework of current models of monolingual and bilingual visual word recognition.

TI Endocytosis-associated patterns in nerve regeneration after peripheral
   nerve injury
SO JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC TRANSLATION
AB Background: Clearance of myelin debris and remyelination of myelin are necessary steps for peripheral nerve remodeling and regeneration. It has yet to be clarified which genes or proteins are involved in endocytosis or exocytosis in the removal of myelin debris during peripheral nerve repair.
   Methods: For this project, a rat model of subacute stage of sciatic nerve injury was established first. Subsequently, normal Schwann cells (NSCs) and activated Schwann cells (ASCs) were harvest before and after peripheral nerve injury (PNI). Following methylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeDIP-seq) and tandem mass tags (TMT) labeling analysis of NSCs and ASCs, what common biomarkers changes in peripheral nervous systems remain to be elucidated.
   Results: A total of 14,770 different expression genes (DEGs) and 3249 different expression proteins (DEPs) were screened between ASCs and NSCs. For the exosomes, the diameter and particles concentration of exosomes were 141.7 nm and 2.97 x 107 particles/mL, respectively. The size distribution of exosomes was 50-200 nm. ASCs showed higher cellular uptake ability than the NSCs by cellular uptake test. Moreover, RAB7A, ARF6, ARF1, VPS45, RAB11A, DNM3, and NEDD4 were the core markers and may control the molecular mechanism of the Endocytosis pathway.
   Conclusion: These biomarkers may play significant roles in the initiation phase of demyelination and axon regeneration.
   The translational potential of this article: This study explores that the endocytosis-associated patterns of Schwann cells may be new therapeutic strategy for nerve tissue engineering and nerve regeneration.

TI Circular RNAs: Promising Biomarkers for Human Diseases
SO EBIOMEDICINE
AB Circular RNA (circRNA) is a group of endogenous noncoding RNA characterized by a covalently closed cyclic structure lacking poly-adenylated tails. Recent studies have suggested that circRNAs play a crucial role in regulating gene expression by acting as a microRNA sponge, RNA binding protein sponge and translational regulator. CircRNAs have become a research hotspot because of their close association with the development of diseases. Some circRNAs are reportedly expressed in a tissue-and development stage-specific manner. Furthermore, due to other features of circRNAs including stability, conservation and high abundance in body fluids, circRNAs are believed to be potential biomarkers for various diseases. In the present review, we provide the current understanding of biogenesis and gene regulatory mechanisms of circRNAs, summarize the recent studies on circRNAs as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, and highlight the major advantages and limitations of circRNAs as novel biomarkers based on existing knowledge.

TI TRPM channels and magnesium in early embryonic development
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB Magnesium (Mg2+) is the second most abundant cellular cation and is essential for all stages of life, from the early embryo to adult. Mg2+ deficiency causes or contributes to many human diseases, including migraine headaches, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, hypotension, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiac arrhythmias. Although the concentration of Mg2+ in the extracellular environment can vary significantly, the total intracellular Mg2+ concentration is actively maintained within a relatively narrow range (14 - 20 mM) via tight, yet poorly understood, regulation of intracellular Mg2+ by Mg2+ transporters and Mg2+-permeant ion channels. Recent studies have continued to add to the growing number of Mg2+ transporters and ion channels involved in Mg2+ homeostasis, including TRPM6 and TRPM7, members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel family. Mutations in TRPM6, including amino acid substitutions that prevent its heterooligomerization with TRPM7, occur in the rare autosomal-recessive disease hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia (HSH). Genetic ablation of either gene in mice results in early embryonic lethality, raising the question of whether these channels' capacity to mediate Mg2+ influx plays an important role in embryonic development. Here we review what is known of the function of Mg2+ in early development and summarize recent findings regarding the function of the TRPM6 and TRPM7 ion channels during embryogenesis.

TI Shiftless Restricts Viral Gene Expression and Influences RNA Granule
   Formation during Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus Lytic
   Replication
SO JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
AB In the past 5 years, SHFL has emerged as a novel and integral piece of the innate immune response to viral infection. SHFL has been reported to restrict the replication of multiple viruses, including several flaviviruses and the retrovirus HIV-1.
   Herpesviral infection reflects thousands of years of coevolution and the constant struggle between virus and host for control of cellular gene expression. During Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) lytic replication, the virus rapidly seizes control of host gene expression machinery by triggering a massive RNA decay event via a virally encoded endoribonuclease, SOX. This virus takeover strategy decimates close to 80% of cellular transcripts, reallocating host resources toward viral replication. The host cell, however, is not entirely passive in this assault on RNA stability. A small pool of host transcripts that actively evade SOX cleavage has been identified over the years. One such "escapee," C19ORF66 (herein referred to as Shiftless [SHFL]), encodes a potent antiviral protein capable of restricting the replication of multiple DNA and RNA viruses and retroviruses, including KSHV. Here, we show that SHFL restricts KSHV replication by targeting the expression of critical viral early genes, including the master transactivator protein, KSHV ORF50, and thus subsequently the entire lytic gene cascade. Consistent with previous reports, we found that the SHFL interactome throughout KSHV infection is dominated by RNA-binding proteins that influence both translation and protein stability, including the viral protein ORF57, a crucial regulator of viral RNA fate. We next show that SHFL affects cytoplasmic RNA granule formation, triggering the disassembly of processing bodies. Taken together, our findings provide insights into the complex relationship between RNA stability, RNA granule formation, and the antiviral response to KSHV infection. IMPORTANCE In the past 5 years, SHFL has emerged as a novel and integral piece of the innate immune response to viral infection. SHFL has been reported to restrict the replication of multiple viruses, including several flaviviruses and the retrovirus HIV-1. However, to date, the mechanism(s) by which SHFL restricts DNA virus infection remains largely unknown. We have previously shown that following its escape from KSHV-induced RNA decay, SHFL acts as a potent antiviral factor, restricting nearly every stage of KSHV lytic replication. In this study, we set out to determine the mechanism by which SHFL restricts KSHV infection. We demonstrate that SHFL impacts all classes of KSHV genes and found that SHFL restricts the expression of several key early genes, including KSHV ORF50 and ORF57. We then mapped the interactome of SHFL during KSHV infection and found several host and viral RNA-binding proteins that all play crucial roles in regulating RNA stability and translation. Lastly, we found that SHFL expression influences RNA granule formation both outside and within the context of KSHV infection, highlighting its broader impact on global gene expression. Collectively, our findings highlight a novel relationship between a critical piece of the antiviral response to KSHV infection and the regulation of RNA-protein dynamics.

TI Genre and Stylistic Features of the Modern Audiobook
SO TEKST KNIGA KNIGOIZDANIE-TEXT BOOK PUBLISHING
AB Modern technological conditions make it possible to create, quickly replicate and use audio books conveniently. Audio books are one of the fastest growing segments of the global publishing market. Informative issues of creating audio books, not technological ones, are in the research focus of the article. The content of an audiobook is a voiced text that refers to the "auditory literature". Assessments of the quality of the auditory literature are polar. On the one hand, it is considered secondary to the original literary text; on the other hand, it is a self-contained artistic phenomenon with its own aesthetic nature. In this article, an audiobook is considered precisely in the aspect of its artistic value, which is highlighted when speaking about the genre nature of the voiced text. The genre features of the voiced text in this study are identified taking into account the communicative features of its formal-stylistic features. The communicative nature of the audiobook genre is associated with two types of reading, which reflect the opposite positions of the two participants in communication. On the one hand, this is an expressive reading aloud, which can also be defined as staged reading. Genetically, this type of reading is associated with public performances of artists and initially assumed live reading. Further, this type of reading is transformed into the genre of radio plays, called "theater at the microphone". In modern communicative practices of creating and replicating audio content, including one related to the actor's readings of works of art, there is no binding to time and place. On the other hand, this is auditory reading, a modification of which is audio reading in modern technological conditions. If auditory reading is the first reading practice of a child mastering books from the voice of a parent, then audio reading is the choice of an adult who can read. The acoustic representation of a literary work is associated not only with the performance of elementary technical characteristics of sound, but also with the introduction of a certain aesthetic value into it. The creative translation of a literary text from verbal to acoustic should preserve its value in the aesthetic plane, without reducing it to a purely pragmatic one. Actualization of the aesthetic value of an audiobook outside of its paper format is associated with the principles of its directing and editorial preparation - the principles associated with the implementation of the stylistic characteristics of the genre form of an audiobook. Translation of a verbal literary text into an audio one is carried out as a result of comparing reading a book to dramatic action. In this case, the forming element of the genre becomes the sounding text itself. In the case of audio books, the reader's voice as a performer's instrument and the musical noise accompaniment of the text read is a style-forming genre element. The article traces the publishing strategies for the embodiment of the formal-stylistic features of the audiobook genre in the context of modern audio cultural practices.

TI Virioplankton of the Kara Sea and the Yenisei River estuary in early
   spring
SO ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
AB Here we present our research results on the virioplankton of the shelf zone of the Kara Sea. This is the first study of viruses and bacteria done in the Kara Sea in early spring when viruses can play an important role in the abundance and production control of the bacterioplankton. All other studies cover July September, that is, when the Kara Sea is completely ice-free and the community of viruses and bacteria is in an absolutely different stage of development. The samples were collected and processed on board of the vessel "Norilskiy Nickel" (project Aker ACS 650) between March 29 and April 8, 2016 on the regular cruise Murmansk - Dudinka. The abundance of bacteria (N-B) and viruses (N-V) located both underneath the ice and in the open waters of the Kara Sea and the Yenisei River estuary varied within a range of (0.075-0.429) x 10(6) cells x ml(-1) and (0.30-2.11) x 10(6) viral particles x I, respectively, and the N-V/N-B ratio varied from 2.6 to 15.4. A positive correlation was found between N-B and N-V = 0.70, p 0.05). Viruses with capsid diameter of 16-297 nm were registered in the water samples examined. The transmission electron microscopy data show that the fraction of the virus-infected bacterial cells is about 0.2-2.3% of total N-B. The mean viral-induced mortality of the bacteria calculated from all the sampling stations in the Kara Sea and the Yenisei River estuary was 7.8 +/- 1.2% (with a range from 1.4 to 20.2%) of the daily bacterioplankton production. Our results show that viruses play an important role in the abundance and production of bacterioplankton control in early spring.

TI Circ-NOLC1 promotes epithelial ovarian cancer tumorigenesis and
   progression by binding ESRP1 and modulating CDK1 and RhoA expression
SO CELL DEATH DISCOVERY
AB Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important roles in cancer tumorigenesis and progression, representing prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. In this case, we demonstrated the role of circ-NOLC1 in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Our results have shown that Circ-NOLC1 expression was higher in EOC tissues than in normal tissues, and was positively associated with FIGO stage, differentiation. Among ovarian cancer cell lines, circ-NOLC1 expression was the highest in A2780, and lowest in CAOV3. Overexpression of circ-NOLC1 in CAOV3 cells increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion ability, whereas silencing of circ-NOLC1 in A2780 cells had the opposite effect: however, neither circ-NOLC1 downregulation nor overexpression influenced NOLC1 mRNA expression. In nude mice with subcutaneous tumors, circ-NOLC1 downregulation decreased tumor growth. Bioinformatic analysis and RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation showed that circ-NOLC1 could bind to ESRP1. In addition, the overexpression of circ-NOLC1 significantly increased ESRP1, RhoA, and CDK1 protein and mRNA expression level; circ-NOLC1 downregulation had the opposite effects. The tumor-promoting effect of circ-NOLC1 was inhibited by knockdown of ESRP1, CDK1, or RhoA expression in circ-NOLC1-overexpressing cells, which might act by modulating RhoA and CDK1 expression. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that Circ-NOLC1 might promote EOC tumorigenesis and development by binding ESRP1 and modulating CDK1 and RhoA expression.

TI Hemolymph Ecdysteroid Titer Affects Maternal mRNAs during Bombyx mori
   Oogenesis
SO INSECTS
AB Simple Summary: Both maternal genes and ecdysteroids play important roles during embryonic development. In this study, we aimed to characterize the dynamic landscape of maternal mRNAs and the relationship between maternal genes and ecdysteroids during silkworm oogenesis. For the first time, we determined the start of the accumulation of maternal mRNAs in the ovary at the wandering stage during the larval period. We detected the developmental expression profiles of each gene in the ovary or ovariole. We finally confirmed the role of 20-hydroxyecdysone in regulating maternal gene expression. Taken together, our findings expand the understanding of insect oogenesis and provide a perspective on the embryonic development of the silkworm.Silkworm larval-pupal metamorphosis and the first half of pupal-adult development occur during oogenesis from previtellogenesis to vitellogenesis and include two peaks of the hemolymph ecdysteroid titer. Moreover, a rise in 20-hydroxyecdysone titer in early pupae can trigger the first major transition from previtellogenesis to vitellogenesis in silkworm oogenesis. In this study, we first investigated the expression patterns of 66 maternal genes in the ovary at the wandering stage. We then examined the developmental expression profiles in six time-series samples of ovaries or ovarioles by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. We found that the transcripts of 22 maternal genes were regulated by 20-hydroxyecdysone in the isolated abdomens of the pupae following a single injection of 20-hydroxyecdysone. This study is the first to determine the relationship between 20-hydroxyecdysone and maternal genes during silkworm oogenesis. These findings provide a basis for further research into the embryonic development of Bombyx mori.

TI How do surgeons decide to refer patients for adjuvant cancer treatment?
   Protocol for a qualitative study
SO IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE
AB Background: Non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer are commonly diagnosed cancers in Canada. Patients diagnosed with early-stage non-small cell lung, breast, or colorectal cancer represent potentially curable populations. For these patients, surgery is the primary mode of treatment, with (neo) adjuvant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, radiotherapy) recommended according to disease stage. Data from our research in Nova Scotia, as well as others', demonstrate that a substantial proportion of non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer patients, for whom practice guidelines recommend (neo) adjuvant therapy, are not referred for an oncologist consultation. Conversely, surveillance data and clinical experience suggest that breast cancer patients have much higher referral rates. Since surgery is the primary treatment, the surgeon plays a major role in referring patients to oncologists. Thus, an improved understanding of how surgeons make decisions related to oncology services is important to developing strategies to optimize referral rates. Few studies have examined decision making for (neo) adjuvant therapy from the perspective of the cancer surgeon. This study will use qualitative methods to examine decision-making processes related to referral to oncology services for individuals diagnosed with potentially curable non-small cell lung, breast, or colorectal cancer.
   Methods: A qualitative study will be conducted, guided by the principles of grounded theory. The study design is informed by our ongoing research, as well as a model of access to health services. The method of data collection will be in-depth, semi structured interviews. We will attempt to recruit all lung, breast, and/or colorectal cancer surgeons in Nova Scotia (n = 42), with the aim of interviewing a minimum of 34 surgeons. Interviews will be audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Data will be collected and analyzed concurrently, with two investigators independently coding and analyzing the data. Analysis will involve an inductive, grounded approach using constant comparative analysis.
   Discussion: The primary outcomes will be (1) identification of the patient, surgeon, institutional, and health-system factors that influence surgeons' decisions to refer non-small cell lung, breast, and colorectal cancer patients to oncology services when consideration for (neo) adjuvant therapy is recommended and (2) identification of potential strategies that could optimize referral to oncology for appropriate individuals.

TI circIGHG-Induced Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition Promotes Oral
   Squamous Cell Carcinoma Progression via miR-142-5p/IGF2BP3 Signaling
SO CANCER RESEARCH
AB Circular RNAs (circRNA) are a new member of endogenously produced noncoding RNAs that have been characterized as key regulators of gene expression in a variety of malignances. However, the role of circRNA in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains largely unknown. In this study, we identified unique circRNA that regulate OSCC progression and metastasis and pave roads for future research in early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of OSCC. Transcriptomic analyses identified a circRNA derived from IGHG locus (circIGHG) as significantly upregulated in OSCC and positively associated with poor prognosis of OSCC. cirdGHG directly bound miR-142-5p and consequently elevated IGF2BP3 activity. Knockdown of circIGHG led to impaired expression of IGF2BP3 and attenuated aggressiveness of OSCC cells. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition was the main mechanism through which circIGHG/IGF2BP3 promotes metastasis of OSCC. Overall, these results demonstrate that circIGHG plays a pivotal role in OSCC development and metastasis and has potential to serve as a biomarker and therapeutic target for early-stage diagnosis and treatment of OSCC.
   Significance These findings broaden our insights regarding regulation of OSCC progression by circular RNA and serve as a reference for future clinical research in OSCC diagnosis and treatment.

TI A multi-organ analysis of the role of mTOR in fetal alcohol spectrum
   disorders
SO FASEB JOURNAL
AB Alcohol exposure during gestation can lead to fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), an array of cognitive and physical developmental impairments. Over the past two and a half decades, Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) has emerged at the nexus of many fields of study, and has recently been implicated in FASD etiology. mTOR plays an integral role in modulating anabolic and catabolic activities, including protein synthesis and autophagy. These processes are vital for proper development and can have long lasting effects following alcohol exposure, such as impaired hippocampal and synapse formation, reduced brain size, as well as cognitive, behavioral, and memory impairments. We highlight recent advances in the field of FASD, primarily with regard to animal model discoveries and discuss the interaction between alcohol and mTOR in the context of various tissues, including brain, placenta, bone, and muscle, with respect to developmental alcohol exposure paradigms. The current review focuses on novel FASD research within the context of the mTOR signaling and sheds light on mechanistic etiologies at various biological levels including molecular, cellular, and functional, across multiple stages of development and illuminates the dichotomy between the different mTOR complexes and their unique signaling roles.

TI Epigallocatechin gallate targets FTO and inhibits adipogenesis in an
   mRNA m(6)A-YTHDF2-dependent manner
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBESITY
AB Background/objective: N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) modification of mRNA plays a role in regulating adipogenesis. However, its underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the most abundant catechin in green tea, plays a critical role in anti-obesity and anti-adipogenesis.
   Methods: High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-QqQ-MS/MS) was performed to determine the m(6)A levels in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. The effects of EGCG on the m(6)A levels in specific genes were determined by methylated RNA immunoprecipitation coupled with quantitative real-time PCR (meRIP-qPCR). Several adipogenesis makers and cell cycle genes were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and western blotting. Lipid accumulation was evaluated by oil red O staining. All measurements were performed at least for three times.
   Results: Here we showed that EGCG inhibited adipogenesis by blocking the mitotic clonal expansion (MCE) at the early stage of adipocyte differentiation. Exposing 3T3-L1 cells to EGCG reduced the expression of fat mass and obesityassociated (FTO) protein, an m(6)A demethylase, which led to increased overall levels of RNA m(6)A methylation. Cyclin A2 (CCNA2) and cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) play vital roles in MCE. The m(6)A levels of CCNA2 and CDK2 mRNA were dramatically enhanced by EGCG. Interestingly, EGCG increased the expression of YTH N-6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 2 (YTHDF2), which recognized and decayed methylated mRNAs, resulting in decreased protein levels of CCNA2 and CDK2. As a result, MCE was blocked and adipogenesis was inhibited. FTO overexpression and YTHDF2 knockdown in 3T3-L1 cells significantly increased CCNA2 and CDK2 protein levels and ameliorated the EGCG-induced adipogenesis inhibition. Thus, m(6)A-dependent CCNA2 and CDK2 expressions mediated by FTO and YTHDF2 contributed to EGCG-induced adipogenesis inhibition.
   Conclusion: Our findings provide mechanistic insights into how m(6)A is involved in the EGCG regulation of adipogenesis and shed light on its anti-obesity effect.

TI What motivates informal caregivers of people with dementia (PWD): a
   qualitative study
SO BMC PALLIATIVE CARE
AB Background The burden of caring for People with Dementia (PWD) is heavy; identifying incentives that motivate them in providing care is essential in facilitating and optimizing care. This study aims to explore and describe these motivating factors. Methods We conducted this qualitative study between January 2016 and January 2017 in Isfahan, Iran. Data were extracted through in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 19 caregivers of PWD. These data were then examined through thematic content analysis. Results We identified four categories of psychological motives based on the caregivers' feedback and experience. These include 1) Moral-based motives, 2) Religious, and spiritual motives; 3) Financial motives, and 4) Wicked motives. Conclusions Our results revealed several aspects of caregivers' motives. They include moral, religious, and spiritual aspects; sharing housing accommodations, and the likelihood of inheriting a portion of the patient's assets based on unspoken rules and informal arrangements in the family, and wicked and immoral aspects. These findings can inform future efforts in enhancing the experiences of caregivers of PWD, and subsequently, the quality of care these patients receive. It further suggests that family members, members of a religious and spiritual organization, as well as social media, could play important roles in setting the stage.

TI Arboreal Tradition and Subversion: An Ecocritical Reading of
   Shakespeare's Portrayal of Trees, Woods and Forests
SO MULTICULTURAL SHAKESPEARE-TRANSLATION APPROPRIATION AND PERFORMANCE
AB This paper analyses from an ecocritical standpoint the role of trees, woods and forests and their symbolism in William Shakespeare's Hamlet, Macbeth, The Merchant of Venice, The Merry Wives of Windsor, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Richard II and The Tempest. The analysis begins with an outline of the representation of trees on stage to continue with a 'close reading' of the mentioned plays, clearly distinguishing individual trees from woods and forests. Individual types of trees may represent death, sadness, sorcery and premonitions, or serve as meeting places, while forests and woods are frequently portrayed as settings which create an atmosphere of confusion, false appearances, danger and magic. This reflects a long-standing historical connection between trees and forests and the supernatural in literature and culture. However, while individual trees largely reflect traditional symbology, conventional interpretations are often subverted in Shakespeare's treatment of forests and woods. From all this we may infer that Shakespeare was not only familiar with the traditions associated to individual tree species and forests in general, but also that he made conscious and active use of these in order to enhance the meaning of an action, reinforce character traits, further the plot and create a specific atmosphere. More subtly, the collective arboreal environments can also be interpreted as spaces in which superstitions and older societal models are questioned in favour of a more rational and reasonable understanding of the world.

TI SRSF9 promotes colorectal cancer progression via stabilizing DSN1 mRNA
   in an m6A-related manner
SO JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
AB Background Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 9 (SRSF9) is a classical RNA-binding protein that is essential for regulating gene expression programs through its interaction with target RNA. Whether SRSF9 plays an essential role in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression and can serve as a therapeutic target is largely unknown. Here, we highlight new findings on the role of SRSF9 in CRC progression and elucidate the underlying mechanism. Methods CRC cell lines and clinical tissue samples were used. qRT-PCR, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry (IHC), gain- and loss-of-function assays, animal xenograft model studies, bioinformatic analysis, methylated single-stranded RNA affinity assays, gene-specific m6A quantitative qRT-PCR, dual-luciferase reporter assays and RNA stability assays were performed in this study. Results The expression level of SRSF9 was higher in CRC cell lines than that in an immortal human intestinal epithelial cell line. Overexpression of SRSF9 was positively associated with lymph node metastasis and Dukes stage. Functionally, SRSF9 promoted cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro and xenograft growth. The results of bioinformatic analysis indicated that DSN1 was the downstream target of SRSF9. In CRC cells and clinical tissue samples, the expression of SRSF9 was positively associated with the expression of DSN1. Knockdown of DSN1 partially inhibited the SRSF9-induced phenotype in CRC cells. Mechanistically, we further found that SRSF9 is an m6A-binding protein and that m6A modifications were enriched in DSN1 mRNA in CRC cells. Two m6A modification sites (chr20:36773619-36773620 and chr20:36773645-chr20:36773646) in the SRSF9-binding region (chr20:36773597-36773736) of DSN1 mRNA were identified. SRSF9 binds to DSN1 in an m6A motif- and dose-dependent manner. SRSF9 modulates the expression of DSN1 in CRC cells. Such expression regulation was largely impaired upon methyltransferase METTL3 knockdown. Moreover, knockdown of SRSF9 accelerated DSN1 mRNA turnover, while overexpression of SRSF9 stabilized DSN1 mRNA in CRC cells. Such stabilizing was also weakened upon METTL3 knockdown. Conclusion Overexpression of SRSF9 was associated with lymph node metastasis and Dukes stage in CRC. Knockdown of DSN1 eliminated the effects by SRSF9 overexpression in CRC. Our results indicated that SRSF9 functions as an m6A-binding protein (termed "reader") by enhancing the stability of DSN1 mRNA in m6A-related manner. Our study is the first to report that SRSF9-mediated m6A recognition has a crucial role in CRC progression, and highlights SRSF9 as a potential therapeutic target for CRC management.

TI Differential alternative polyadenylation contributes to the
   developmental divergence between two rice subspecies, japonica and
   indica
SO PLANT JOURNAL
AB Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a widespread post-transcriptional mechanism that regulates gene expression through mRNA metabolism, playing a pivotal role in modulating phenotypic traits in rice (Oryza sativa L.). However, little is known about the APA-mediated regulation underlying the distinct characteristics between two major rice subspecies, indica and japonica. Using a poly(A)-tag sequencing approach, polyadenylation (poly(A)) site profiles were investigated and compared pairwise from germination to the mature stage between indica and japonica, and extensive differentiation in APA profiles was detected genome-wide. Genes with subspecies-specific poly(A) sites were found to contribute to subspecies characteristics, particularly in disease resistance of indica and cold-stress tolerance of japonica. In most tissues, differential usage of APA sites exhibited an apparent impact on the gene expression profiles between subspecies, and genes with those APA sites were significantly enriched in quantitative trait loci (QTL) related to yield traits, such as spikelet number and 1000-seed weight. In leaves of the booting stage, APA site-switching genes displayed global shortening of 3 ' untranslated regions with increased expression in indica compared with japonica, and they were overrepresented in the porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism pathways. This phenomenon may lead to a higher chlorophyll content and photosynthesis in indica than in japonica, being associated with their differential growth rates and yield potentials. We further constructed an online resource for querying and visualizing the poly(A) atlas in these two rice subspecies. Our results suggest that APA may be largely involved in developmental differentiations between two rice subspecies, especially in leaf characteristics and the stress response, broadening our knowledge of the post-transcriptional genetic basis underlying the divergence of rice traits.

TI The script form in Soviet and Russian film studies
SO STUDIES IN RUSSIAN AND SOVIET CINEMA
AB This article explores the development of the script form in Soviet/Russian scriptwriting, which has drawn particular attention in the 1920s, when a polemic arose among film theorists and practitioners concerning the 'iron' and 'emotional' script. Sergei Eisenstein and Aleksandr Rzheshevskii, among others, favoured the emotional script with its expressive record of the future film to the rigid production plan of the 'iron script'. In the 1930s, this polemic was resolved with the emergence of the 'literary' script, which united elements of both forms. Valentin Turkin, a pedagogue at Moscow's Film School and author of the first Soviet textbook on film dramaturgy, played an important role in teaching of scriptwriting. Turkin defined the script as a heterogeneous literary form, an approach that influenced film dramaturgy into the 1960s-1970s, when Turkin's theses were developed further: the scriptwriter's work on the future film and on the script's subsequent screen realisation are fruitful only through the literary script form. This approach dominated in teaching well into the 1990s, until the American format of the script was introduced with the first translations of textbooks into Russian, effectively returning to the 'iron' script form.

TI The RNA editing factor DUA1 is crucial to chloroplast development at low
   temperature in rice
SO NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB Low temperature stress hinders plant growth and chloroplast development and can limit the geographic range of cultivars. In rice, japonica cultivars have greater chilling tolerance than indica cultivars, but the molecular mechanism underlying chilling tolerance is unclear. Here, we report an RNA-binding protein, DUA1, cloned from the indica cultivar Dular, which exhibits a deficiency in chloroplast development at an early stage of development under low-temperature conditions. DUA1 shares high sequence homology with the pentatricopeptide repeat family and functions in plastid RNA editing under low-temperature conditions. Our data suggest that DUA1 can bind to the plastid-encoded rps8-182 transcript and disruption of DUA1 activity impairs editing. The RNA editing cofactor WSP1, a partner of DUA1, also participates in chloroplast development at low temperature. Western blot analysis indicates that WSP1 enhances DUA1 stability under low temperatures. DUA1 sequence analyses of rice core germplasm revealed that three major haplotypes of DUA1 and one haplotype showed substantial differences in chlorophyll content under low-temperature conditions. Variation at DUA1 may play an important role in the adaptation of rice to different growing regions.

TI Improved Collaborative Filtering Automatic Assessment System for
   Teaching English Writing in College
SO ADVANCES IN MULTIMEDIA
AB In the context of economic globalization, as an international language, English plays an increasingly essential role in the communication and exchange of ideas. As an output skill that fully reflects one's linguistic and cultural literacy and logical thinking ability, English writing is undoubtedly the most difficult of the four basic skills of listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Writing is a form of expression that enables human thoughts to communicate and exchange across time and space, and it is also a powerful witness to the collision of ideas. However, most college students treat English writing with contempt. The reasons for this situation are related to the traditional teaching methods and assessment methods of English writing in universities. After all, today, many universities focus on the development of learners' input skills or on the training of translation skills in the workplace. However, the development of English writing skills is weak. As a result, a great number of learners' English writing skills lag behind other skills. This is because, for many years, the English writing curriculum and teaching mode in universities have only emphasized students' learning of passive language input and rarely highlighted the importance of language output skills and activities. As a result, the imbalance in the interaction between language input and output has led to a lack of students' writing skills. The teaching model of college English writing is mostly that teachers teach the theory and skills of writing through model essay analysis, and then, they are responsible for assigning writing tasks. The new standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education in 2001 also clearly state that the evaluation system should reflect the diversity of evaluation subjects and the variety of evaluation methods. In other words, both outcome evaluation and process evaluation should be considered. The focus of formative assessment is on students' learning process. The evaluation content focuses on students' performance, emotions, attitudes, and learning strategies in the learning process. The subjects of evaluation are teachers, students, and peers, which coincide with the requirements of the new curriculum reform. After more than 20 years of lightning-fast development in the Internet era, China's Internet industry has achieved unprecedented success and is playing an unprecedented role on the world stage. Under the guidance of relevant policies, China is steadily moving toward becoming a cyber power. Education is the main means of training talents in China, but the traditional teaching mode is bounded by time and place. Therefore, teaching through the Internet is convenient and unconstrained in this era. In addition, the convenient connection of mobile Internet anytime and anywhere has facilitated the rapid integration of online and offline education. Education, as a future-oriented business, is bound to bring about a change. In this study, an improved collaborative filtering automatic assessment system for teaching English writing in college is designed.

TI Identification and Functional Analysis of the Novel ORF4 Protein Encoded
   by Porcine Circovirus Type 2
SO JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
AB Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the primary causative agent of porcine circovirus-associated diseases in pigs. To date, viral proteins Cap, Rep, Rep', and ORF3, encoded by the PCV2 genome, have been described. Here, transcription and translation of a novel viral gene within the PCV2 genome (designated ORF4) was determined and functionally analyzed in vitro and in vivo. Northern blot analysis indicated that the RNA transcribed from the ORF4 gene is about 180 bp in length and overlaps ORF3 in the same direction. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed that the viral ORF4 protein is not essential for virus replication in PK-15 cells and in mice infected with an ORF4-deficient PCV2 (PCV2 Delta). PCV2 Delta triggered higher activity levels of caspase-3 and -8 than wild-type PCV2 (wPCV2) in PK-15 cells. The antigenic epitopes of two mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) raised against the viral ORF4 protein were mapped to the same 19KSSASPR25 peptide. Expression of ORF4 was confirmed using the specific MAbs in wPCV2-infected PK-15 cells and mice. Mice infected with PCV2 Delta had a higher serum viral load (genomic copies) and more severe lymphoid tissue damage in the spleen than those infected with wPCV2. Meanwhile, flow-cytometric analysis indicated that the PCV2 Delta infection caused a significant decrease of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes. Our results demonstrate that ORF4 is a newly discovered viral protein that is not essential for PCV2 replication but plays a role in suppressing caspase activity and regulating CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes during PCV2 infection.

TI A duet and/or a concerto? Simultaneous interpreters' working memory and
   interpreting expertise
SO BABEL-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE LA TRADUCTION-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF
   TRANSLATION
AB Working memory and interpreting expertise are generally acknowledged as two essential factors that affect the interpreting process. With reference to the compensation model, the independent influences model, and the rich-get-richer model proposed in cognitive psychology concerning the interplay between working memory and domain expertise, this experimental study, by varying the delivery speed of the source speech, examines the interplay between working memory and interpreting expertise in the setting of simultaneous interpreting. This study finds that (1) working memory and interpreting expertise can each have a positive impact on simultaneous interpreting quality; (2) other factors being equal, interpreting expertise can have a greater impact on simultaneous interpreting than working memory, and when the interpreting task proves more challenging, interpreting expertise can help relieve the pressure triggered by inadequate working memory; (3) working memory and interpreting expertise function differently in simultaneous interpreting in different stages: for beginner interpreting students, working memory's contribution to the quality of simultaneous interpreting is more prominent, while for advanced interpreting students, interpreting expertise plays a more direct and prominent role, and the composite influence of working memory and interpreting expertise on simultaneous interpreting performance is weakened due to the increasing impact of other factors.

TI Somatostatin Receptor Antagonists for Imaging and Therapy
SO JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
AB Somatostatin receptor (sstr) scintigraphy for imaging and sstr analogs for treatment have been used for more than 20 y. An important improvement in recent years was the introduction of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy with radiolabeled sstr agonists, such as [Y-90-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotide or [Lu-177-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotide (Y-90- or Lu-177-DOTATOC, respectively) and [Lu-177-DOTA(0), Tyr(3)]octreotate (Lu-177-DOTATATE). PET/CT with Ga-68-labeled sstr agonists, such as Ga-68-DOTATOC, Ga-68-DOTATATE, and [Ga-68-DOTA, 1-Nal(3)]octreotide (Ga-68-DOTANOC), plays an important role in staging and restaging neuroendocrine tumors. Most importantly, sstr scintigraphy and sstr PET/CT can distinguish patients who will qualify for and benefit from peptide receptor radionuclide therapy. This characteristic of sstr targeting is important because it allows a personalized treatment approach (theranostic approach). Until recently, it was thought that internalization of the radiolabeled agonist was mandatory for sstr-mediated imaging and therapy. It was Ginj et al. who proposed in 2006 the paradigm shift that radiolabeled sstr antagonists may perform better than agonists despite the lack of internalization. Despite the rather limited number of head-to-head comparisons of sstr antagonists and agonists, the superiority of sstr antagonists was demonstrated in several cases. From a small library of sstr antagonists, the analog JR11 (Cpa-c[D-Cys-Aph(Hor)-D-Aph(Cbm)-Lys-Thr-Cys]-D-Tyr-NH2), an antagonist with selectivity for sstr subtype 2, showed the best overall characteristics for sstr subtype 2 targeting and was therefore selected for clinical translation. JR11 is under clinical development as a PET imaging agent when labeled with Ga-68 (Ga-68-NODAGA-JR11 or Ga-68-OPS202) and as a therapeutic agent when labeled with Lu-177 (Lu-177-DOTA-JR11 or Lu-177-OPS201). In this article, we discuss the development and current status of radiolabeled sstr antagonists. Evidence based on preclinical work, on quantitative in vivo autoradiography of human tumor slices, and on human data now supports a shift to sstr antagonists.

TI Multiplicity of Buc copies in Atlantic salmon contrasts with loss of the
   germ cell determinant in primates, rodents and axolotl
SO BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY
AB Background: The primordial germ cells (PGCs) giving rise to gametes are determined by two different mechanisms in vertebrates. While the germ cell fate in mammals and salamanders is induced by zygotic signals, maternally delivered germ cell determinants specify the PGCs in birds, frogs and teleost fish. Assembly of the germ plasm in the oocyte is organized by the single Buc in zebrafish, named Velo1 in Xenopus, and by Oskar in Drosophila. Secondary loss of oskar in several insect lineages coincides with changes in germline determination strategies, while the presence of buc in mammals suggests functions not associated with germline formation.
   Results: To clarify the evolutionary history of buc we searched for the gene in genomes available from various chordates. No buc sequence was found in lamprey and chordate invertebrates, while the gene was identified in a conserved syntenic region in elephant shark, spotted gar, teleosts, Comoran coelacanth and most tetrapods. Rodents have probably lost the buc gene, while a premature translation stop was found in primates and in Mexican axolotl lacking germ plasm. In contrast, several buc and buc-like (bucL) paralogs were identified in the teleosts examined, including zebrafish, and the tetraploid genome of Atlantic salmon harbors seven buc and bucL genes. Maternal salmon buc1a, buc2a and buc2b mRNAs were abundant in unfertilized eggs together with dnd and vasa mRNAs. Immunostained salmon Buc1a was restricted to cleavage furrows in 4-cell stage embryos similar to a fluorescent zebrafish Buc construct injected in salmon embryos. Salmon Buc1a and Buc2a localized together with DnD, Vasa and Dazl within the Balbiani body of early oocytes.
   Conclusions: Buc probably originated more than 400 million years ago and might have played an ancestral role in assembling germ plasm. Functional redundancy or subfunctionalization of salmon Buc paralogs in germline formation is suggested by the maternally inherited mRNAs of three salmon buc genes, the localized Buc1a in the cleavage furrows and the distribution of Buc1a and Buc2a in the Balbiani body during oogenesis. The extra-ovarian expression of salmon buc genes and the presence of a second zebrafish bucL gene suggest additional functions not related to germ cell specification.

TI DNA topoisomerase II beta as a molecular switch in neural
   differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells
SO ANNALS OF HEMATOLOGY
AB Two isoforms of DNA topoisomerase II (topo II) have been identified in mammalian cells, named topo II alpha and topo II beta. Topo II alpha plays an essential role in segregation of daughter chromosomes and thus for cell proliferation in mammalian cells. Unlike its isozyme topo II alpha, topo II beta is greatly expressed upon terminal differentiation of neuronal cells. Although there have been accumulating evidence about the crucial role of topo II beta in neural development through activation or repression of developmentally regulated genes at late stages of neuronal differentiation, there have been no reports that analyzed the roles of topo II beta in the neural trans differentiation process of multipotent stem cells. Terminal differentiation of neurons and transdifferentiation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) are two distinct processes. Therefore, the functional significance of topo II beta may also be different in these differentiation systems. MSC transdifferentiation into neuron-like cells represents an useful model to further validate the role of topo II beta in neuronal differentiation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the subset of genes that are regulated in neural transdifferentiation of bone marrow-derived human MSCs (BM-hMSCs) in vitro and find genes related with topo II beta. For this purpose, topo II beta was silenced by specific small interfering RNAs in hMSCs and cells were induced to differentiate into neuron-like cells. Differentiation and silencing of topo II beta were monitored by real-time cell analysis and also expressions of topo II isoforms were analyzed. Change in transcription patterns of genes upon topo II beta silencing was identified by DNA microarray analysis, and apparently genes involved in regulation of several ion channels and transporters, vesicle function, and cell calcium metabolism were particularly affected by topo II beta silencing suggesting that topoII beta silencing can significantly alter the gene expression pattern of genes involved in variety of biological processes and signal transduction pathways including transcription, translation, cell trafficking, vesicle function, transport, cell morphology, neuron guidance, growth, polarity, and axonal growth. It appears that the deregulation of these pathways may contribute to clarify the further role of topo II beta in neural differentiation.

TI Characterization and Comparison of Microbiota in the Gastrointestinal
   Tracts of the Goat (Capra hircus) During Preweaning Development
SO FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB Bacterial communities in gastrointestinal tracts (GIT) play an important role in animal health and performance. Despite its importance, little information is available on the establishment of microbial populations in the goat GIT or on changes occurring during early development. Therefore, this study investigated the bacterial community dynamics of the rumen, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colon in 15 goats at five developmental stages (0, 14, 28, 42, and 56 days old) by using 16S rDNA sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR technology. 940 genera were found to belong to 44 phyla distributed along the GIT. As a whole, the microbial richness and diversity showed a clear increasing trend as the kids aged and alpha diversity differed significantly among GIT compartments mainly occurring at middle day ages (14 and 28 days). Principal coordinate analysis indicated that the bacterial community displayed distinct temporal and spatial specificity along the GIT in preweaning goats. As kids aged, the phylum Firmicutes was replaced by Bacteroidetes in rumen, whereas Proteobacteria in the large intestine was displaced by Firmicutes. The phylum Proteobacteria was mainly present in the small intestine in older animals. In the rumen, taxa, such as Bacillus and Lactococcus decreased and Prevotella, Treponema, Ruminococcus, and unclassified Prevotellaceae increased with the age of kids. Furthermore, a lower proportion of taxa, such as Lactobacillus and Bacteroides was observed with higher abundances of both Christensenellaceae_R_7 and Ruminococcus in duodenum and jejunum in older animals. In the large intestine, the microbiota displayed taxonomic dynamics with increases of Ruminococcaceae UCG 005, unclassified Lachnospiraceae, Bamesiella, and Blautia as kids aged. Predicted pathway analysis suggested that genes involved in amino acid metabolism, and translation were abundant in both rumen and duodenum, while genes involved in membrane transport and carbohydrate metabolism were enriched in the large intestine. These results indicate that both the microbial colonization process and potential function exert a temporal-spatial specificity throughout the GIT of goats. This study provides new insight into the temporal dynamics of GIT microbiota development during preweaning and will aid to develop strategies for improving animal health and downstream production.

TI Antioxidative phytoceuticals to ameliorate pancreatitis in animal
   models: An answer from nature
SO WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
AB Despite enthusiastic efforts directed at elucidating critical underlying mechanisms towards the identification of novel therapeutic targets for severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), the disease remains without a specific therapy to be executed within the first hours to days after onset of symptoms. Although earlier management for SAP should aim to either treat organ failure or reduce infectious complications, the current standard of care for the general management of AP in the first hours to days after onset of symptoms include intravenous fluid replacement, nutritional changes, and the use of analgesics with a close monitoring of vital signs. Furthermore, repeated evaluation of severity is very important, as the condition is particularly unstable in the early stages. In cases where biliary pancreatitis is accompanied by acute cholangitis or in cases where biliary stasis is suspected, an early endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is recommended. However, practice guidelines regarding the treatment of pancreatitis are suboptimal. In chronic pancreatitis, conservative management strategies include lifestyle modifications and dietary changes followed by analgesics and pancreatic enzyme supplementation. Recently, attention has been focused on phytoceuticals or antioxidants as agents that could surpass the limitations associated with currently available therapies. Because oxidative stress has been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of pancreatitis, antioxidants alone or combined with conventional therapy may improve oxidative-stress-induced organ damage. Interest in phytoceuticals stems from their potential use as simple, accurate tools for pancreatitis prognostication that could replace older and more tedious methods. Therefore, the use of antioxidative nutrition or phytoceuticals may represent a new direction for clinical research in pancreatitis. In this review article, recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of pancreatitis are discussed and the paradigm shift underway to develop phytoceuticals and antioxidants to treat it is introduced. Despite the promise of studies evaluating the effects of antioxidants/phytoceuticals in pancreatitis, translation to the clinic has thus far been disappointing. However, it is expected that continued research will provide solid evidence to justify the use of antioxidative phytoceuticals in the treatment of pancreatitis.

TI Paramedic Disaster Health Management Competencies: A Scoping Review
SO PREHOSPITAL AND DISASTER MEDICINE
AB Introduction:Paramedics are tasked with providing 24/7 prehospital emergency care to the community. As part of this role, they are also responsible for providing emergency care in the event of a major incident or disaster. They play a major role in the response stage of such events, both domestic and international. Despite this, specific standardized training in disaster management appears to be variable and inconsistent throughout the profession. A suggested method of building disaster response capacities is through competency-based education (CBE). Core competencies can provide the fundamental basis of collective learning and help ensure consistent application and translation of knowledge into practice. These competencies are often organized into domains, or categories of learning outcomes, as defined by Blooms taxonomy of learning domains. It is these domains of competency, as they relate to paramedic disaster response, that are the subject of this review.Methods:The methodology for this paper to identify existing paramedic disaster response competency domains was adapted from the guidance for the development of systematic scoping reviews, using a methodology developed by members of the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI; Adelaide, South Australia) and members of five Joanna Briggs Collaborating Centres.Results:The literature search identified six articles for review that reported on paramedic disaster response competency domains. The results were divided into two groups: (1) General Core Competency Domains, which are suitable for all paramedics (both Advanced Life Support [ALS] and Basic Life Support [BLS]) who respond to any disaster or major incident; and (2) Specialist Core Competencies, which are deemed necessary competencies to enable a response to certain types of disaster. Further review then showed that three separate and discrete types of competency domains exits in the literature: (1) Core Competencies, (2) Technical/Clinical Competencies, and (3) Specialist Technical/Clinical Competencies.Conclusions:The most common domains of core competencies for paramedic first responders to manage major incidents and disasters described in the literature were identified. If it's accepted that training paramedics in disaster response is an essential part of preparedness within the disaster management cycle, then by including these competency domains into the curriculum development of localized disaster training programs, it will better prepare the paramedic workforce's competence and ability to effectively respond to disasters and major incidents.

TI Addressing institutional and community barriers to development and
   implementation of community-engaged research through competency-based
   academic and community training
SO FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Introduction: The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) focuses on reducing barriers to effective translational research that rapidly translates science to clinical and community interventions to improve individual and community health. Community-Engaged Research (CEnR) plays a crucial role in this process by bridging gaps between research and practice. It effectively generates bi-directional knowledge and communication by engaging patients and communities throughout the translation research process. Skills development, however, is critical to enable investigators and communities to establish successful partnerships in research. While there are many independent CEnR education programs nationally, few curricula are mapped to identified domains and competencies.Assessment of current community engagement educational frameworks and competencies: We located three comprehensive efforts to identify CEnR domains and competencies that we aligned to inform development of our curriculum, which we then mapped to these competencies. The first, undertaken by the NCATS Joint Workgroup on Researcher Training and Education and Community Capacity Building (JWG) was developed to assess training opportunities for academic researchers and community partners to increase their capacity to meaningfully engage collaborators in translational research. The JWG identified curricula, resources, tools, strategies, and models for innovative training programs and community engagement in all stages of research. It also conducted a gap analysis of deficiencies in available resources. Using Competency Mapping, they developed a framework for curriculum mapping that included eight domains, each with two to five competencies of knowledge, attitudes, and skills. The second aligned community-engaged research competencies with online training resources across the CTSA consortium, while the third was focused on Dissemination and Implementation training.Actionable recommendations: Further informed by a conceptual model to advance health equity, we have adapted and integrated these components into a set of modules designed to educate and empower investigators, trainees, students, and community partners to engage in effective CEnR.Discussion: This curriculum fills an important gap in our workforce development and helps to meet needs of our community partners. Following program evaluation and validation, we will offer the curriculum for use and further evaluation by other groups interested in using or adapting it for their own programming.

TI Death as Nuptials and Revelation in Yiddish Dramaturgy: The Danse
   Macabre of the Commandment or Mitzvah Tantz Makaber, Examined as the
   Auxiliary Hypostasis of the Hasidic Danse Macabre in the Peretzian
   Dramatic Masterpiece A Night in the Old Marketplace
SO PHILOLOGICA JASSYENSIA
AB Artistic testament and opus magnum of the visionary genius Isaac Leib Peretz (18521915), the Yiddish dramatic masterpiece A Night in the Old Marketplace ("Bay nakht afn altn mark", 1907, Warsaw) subtly inserts a praiseworthy innovation in the polychrome fabric of European culture: Mitzvah Tantz Makaber or the Danse Macabre of the Commandment. Reinvented as the secondary hypostasis of the Hasidic Danse Macabre, it symbolises a joyfully animated interval of symbiotic sequences (Life-Death-Wisdom). Despite its lugubrious atmosphere, this ephemeral interstice of reviviscency opportunely enlivens the story cleverly constructed by the author. Lauded as the 'Polish Pan' of Yiddish literature, Peretz ingeniously interweaves hilarious dialogue, grotesque details, and traditional Jewish spirituality to convey a nuanced message, the final composition ostensibly outlining an elaborate interplay of ludic allegory and profound wisdom.
   Opting for a holistic approach, my analysis will cover the following essential coordinates: the emergence of the sinister Danse Macabre in the European cultural climate (a medieval allegory preceded by the poematic monologue Vado Mori and The Tale of the Three Living and the Three Dead), superseded by its gradual enrooting into a Jewish context (via the composite cultural medium of ecstatic dance, the archetypal ensemble of the Trickster, and the medieval Speculum tradition), being ultimately reinvented as the Mitzvah Tantz Makaber by the visionary Peretz (his eminently Jewish choreography employs traditional Ashkenazi motifs and extolls Hasidic values). The actual examination of the Danse Macabre of the Commandment, reimagined as the main subcategory of the Hasidic Danse Macabre, will focus on a set of three fundamental phases: the unique way in which Peretz textually illustrates this innovation, the symbolism behind its literary form, and the powerful message conveyed by the parable.
   In current international academia, the Mitzvah Tantz Makaber allegory needs proper identification and examination. Further lacking an autochthonous translation, the Peretzian dramaturgy remains virtually unknown to the public in Romania. Performed exclusively in Yiddish, the superlative play A Night in the Old Marketplace underwent only two productions on the Bucharest theatre stage (in 1930 and 1970). Consequently, the present paper endeavours to remedy a noteworthy hiatus by examining the outstanding literary innovation of the Danse Macabre of the Commandment as an auxiliary hypostasis of the Hasidic Danse Macabre.

TI A scoping review to improve conceptual clarity of interprofessional
   interventions
SO JOURNAL OF INTERPROFESSIONAL CARE
AB Interprofessional education (IPE) and interprofessional collaboration (IPC) have been identified in health education and health care as playing an important role in improving health care services and patient outcomes. Despite a growth in the amount of research in these areas, poor conceptualizations of these interprofessional activities have persisted. Given the conceptual challenges, a scoping review of the interprofessional field was undertaken to map the literature available in order to identify key concepts, theories and sources of evidence. The objective of this review was to develop a theoretically based and empirically tested understanding of IPE and IPC. A total of 104 studies met the criteria and were included for analysis. Studies were examined for their approach to conceptualization, implementation, and assessment of their interprofessional interventions. Half of the studies were used for interprofessional framework development and half for framework testing and refinement. The final framework contains three main types of interprofessional interventions: IPE; interprofessional practice; and interprofessional organization; and describes the nature of each type of intervention by stage, participants, intervention type, interprofessional objectives, and outcomes. The outcomes are delineated as intermediate, patient, and system outcomes. There was very limited use of theory in the studies, and thus theoretical aspects could not be incorporated into the framework. This study offers an initial step in mapping out the interprofessional field and outlines possible ways forward for future research and practice.

TI Extracellular Proton Concentrations Impacts LN229 Glioblastoma Tumor
   Cell Fate via Differential Modulation of Surface Lipids
SO FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
AB Background: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive form of brain cancer with marginal survival rates. GBM extracellular acidosis can profoundly impact its cell fate heterogeneities and progression. However, the molecules and mechanisms that enable GBM tumor cells acid adaptation and consequent cell fate competencies are weakly understood. Since extracellular proton concentrations (pHe) directly intercept the tumor cell plasma membrane, surface lipids must play a crucial role in pHe-dependent tumor cell fate dynamics. Hence, a more detailed insight into the finely tuned pH-dependent modulation of surface lipids is required to generate strategies that can inhibit or surpass tumor cell acid adaptation, thereby forcing the eradication of heterogeneous oncogenic niches, without affecting the normal cells.
   Results: By using image-based single cell analysis and physicochemical techniques, we made a small-scale survey of the effects of pH ranges (physiological: pHe 7.4, low: 6.2, and very low: 3.4) on LN229 glioblastoma cell line surface remodeling and analyzed the consequent cell fate heterogeneities with relevant molecular targets and behavioral assays. Through this basic study, we uncovered that the extracellular proton concentration (1) modulates surface cholesterol-driven cell fate dynamics and (2) induces differential clustering of surface resident GM3 glycosphingolipid which together coordinates the proliferation, migration, survival, and death reprogramming via distinct effects on the tumor cell biomechanical homeostasis. A novel synergy of anti-GM3 antibody and cyclophilin A inhibitor was found to mimic the very low pHe-mediated GM3 supraclustered conformation that elevated the surface rigidity and mechano-remodeled the tumor cell into a differentiated phenotype which eventually succumbed to the anoikis type of cell death, thereby eradicating the tumorigenic niches.
   Conclusion and significance: This work presents an initial insight into the physicochemical capacities of extracellular protons in the generation of glioblastoma tumor cell heterogeneities and cell death via the crucial interplay of surface lipids and their conformational changes. Hence, monitoring of protoncholesterolGM3 correlations in vivo through diagnostic imaging and in vitro in clinical samples may assist better tumor staging and prognosis. The emerged insights have further led to the translation of a pH-dependent mechanisms of oncogenesis control into the surface targeted anti-GBM therapeutics.

TI Targeting P21-Activated Kinase-1 for Metastatic Prostate Cancer
SO CANCERS
AB Simple Summary Metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa) results in high mortality and there are no effective treatments. The molecular mechanisms mediating the transition of early-stage PCa cells into malignant, metastatic cells are not clearly understood. Whereas the TGF beta pathway has been demonstrated to induce the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of prostate cancer cells, it necessitates the activation of the Rac-p21-activated kinase (PAK) signaling in this process. Identifying the role of PAK in mPCa, and compounds targeting its activity may lead to novel therapeutic applications for preventing and treating mPCa. Metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa) has limited therapeutic options and a high mortality rate. The p21-activated kinase (PAK) family of proteins is important in cell survival, proliferation, and motility in physiology, and pathologies such as infectious, inflammatory, vascular, and neurological diseases as well as cancers. Group-I PAKs (PAK1, PAK2, and PAK3) are involved in the regulation of actin dynamics and thus are integral for cell morphology, adhesion to the extracellular matrix, and cell motility. They also play prominent roles in cell survival and proliferation. These properties make group-I PAKs a potentially important target for cancer therapy. In contrast to normal prostate and prostatic epithelial cells, group-I PAKs are highly expressed in mPCA and PCa tissue. Importantly, the expression of group-I PAKs is proportional to the Gleason score of the patients. While several compounds have been identified that target group-I PAKs and these are active in cells and mice, and while some inhibitors have entered human trials, as of yet, none have been FDA-approved. Probable reasons for this lack of translation include issues related to selectivity, specificity, stability, and efficacy resulting in side effects and/or lack of efficacy. In the current review, we describe the pathophysiology and current treatment guidelines of PCa, present group-I PAKs as a potential druggable target to treat mPCa patients, and discuss the various ATP-competitive and allosteric inhibitors of PAKs. We also discuss the development and testing of a nanotechnology-based therapeutic formulation of group-I PAK inhibitors and its significant potential advantages as a novel, selective, stable, and efficacious mPCa therapeutic over other PCa therapeutics in the pipeline.

TI RNA-binding protein CUGBP1 regulates insulin secretion via activation of
   phosphodiesterase 3B in mice
SO DIABETOLOGIA
AB Aims/hypothesis CUG-binding protein 1 (CUGBP1) is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein that regulates RNA processing at several stages including translation, deadenylation and alternative splicing, as well as RNA stability. Recent studies indicate that CUGBP1 may play a role in metabolic disorders. Our objective was to examine its role in endocrine pancreas function through gain-and loss-of-function experiments and to further decipher the underlying molecular mechanisms.
   Methods A mouse model in which type 2 diabetes was induced by a high-fat diet (HFD; 60% energy from fat) and mice on a standard chow diet (10% energy from fat) were compared. Pancreas-specific CUGBP1 overexpression and knockdown mice were generated. Different lengths of the phosphodiesterase subtype 3B (PDE3B) 3' untranslated region (UTR) were cloned for luciferase reporter analysis. Purified CUGBP1 protein was used for gel shift experiments.
   Results CUGBP1 is present in rodent islets and in beta cell lines; it is overexpressed in the islets of diabetic mice. Compared with control mice, the plasma insulin level after a glucose load was significantly lower and glucose clearance was greatly delayed in mice with pancreas-specific CUGBP1 overexpression; the opposite results were obtained upon pancreas-specific CUGBP1 knockdown. Glucose-and glucagon-like peptide1 (GLP-1)-stimulated insulin secretion was significantly attenuated in mouse islets upon CUGBP1 overexpression. This was associated with a strong decrease in intracellular cAMP levels, pointing to a potential role for cAMP PDEs. CUGBP1 overexpression had no effect on the mRNA levels of PDE1A, 1C, 2A, 3A, 4A, 4B, 4D, 7A and 8B subtypes, but resulted in increased PDE3B expression. CUGBP1 was found to directly bind to a specific ATTTGTT sequence residing in the 3' UTR of PDE3B and stabilised PDE3B mRNA. In the presence of the PDE3 inhibitor cilostamide, glucose-and GLP-1-stimulated insulin secretion was no longer reduced by CUGBP1 overexpression. Similar to CUGBP1, PDE3B was overexpressed in the islets of diabetic mice.
   Conclusions/interpretation We conclude that CUGBP1 is a critical regulator of insulin secretion via activating PDE3B. Repressing this protein might provide a potential strategy for treating type 2 diabetes.

TI Identification of a three-m6A related gene risk score model as a
   potential prognostic biomarker in clear cell renal cell carcinoma
SO PEERJ
AB Background: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) has been shown to play important roles in regulating gene expression and phenotypes in both health and disease. Here, our purpose is to construct a m6A-regulrator-based risk score (RS) for prediction of the prognosis of ccRCC.
   Methods: We used clinical and expression data of m6A related genes from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) Cox regression analysis to develop an RS to predict survival of patients with ccRCC, and analyzed correlations between RS and other clinical indicators such as age, grade and stage. Validation of this RS was then engaged in another cohort, E-MTAB-1980 from the ArrayExpress dataset. Finally, we used quantitative real-time PCR to analyze the expression profile of genes consists of the RS.
   Results: A three-gene RS including METTL3, METTL14 and HNRNPA2B1 which can predict overall survival (OS) of ccRCC patients from TCGA. After applying this RS into the validation cohort from Arrayexpress, we found that it successfully reproduced the result; furthermore, the results of PCR validation were in line with our analysis.
   Conclusion: To sum up, our study has identified an RS composed of m6A related genes that may predict the prognosis of ccRCC patients, which might be helpful for future therapeutic strategies. Our results call for further experimental studies for validations.

TI The impact of 3D virtual reality radiography practice on student
   performance in clinical practice
SO RADIOGRAPHY
AB Introduction: Simulation-based learning plays an integral role in preparing students for clinical practice. This study investigated the impact of immersive three-dimensional (3D) virtual reality (VR) simulation-based learning on first-year radiography students' performance in the clinical setting.Methods: A retrospective analysis of first-year radiography clinical assessments was carried out to compare performance pre-and post-introduction of VR. The stage one cohort with no VR education was considered the control group (n = 93). The VR group (n = 98) had seven hours of practice in the immersive VR suite (Virtual Medical Coaching). Experienced clinical tutors assessed first-year students performing an extremity radiographic examination in the clinical setting. Assessment criteria were ranked on a 5-point Likert scale from poor to excellent. Mann Whitney U Tests were applied to compare performance across cohorts.Results: Students trained with VR performed better across 20 of the 22 assessment criteria. VR-trained students performed significantly better (more ranked as 'very good' or 'excellent') than the control group in the following criteria; positioning patients for X-rays (19% difference) (U = 3525, z =-2.66, p < 0.05), selecting exposure factors (12% difference) (U = 3680, z =-3.13, p < 0.05), image appraisal of patient positioning (27% difference) (U = 3448, z =-2.9, p < 0.05) and image appraisal of image quality (18% difference) (U = 3514, z =-2.6, p < 0.05). Their comprehension of clinical indications, equipment set up and explanation of the procedure was also significantly better (p < 0.05).Conclusion: This is the first study to investigate the translation of VR learning into radiography clinical practice. VR learning had a positive impact on the performance of first-year students in their clinical assessment, especially with respect to patient positioning, exposure parameter selection and image appraisal.Implications for practice: VR is a valuable educational tool in preparing novice radiography students for clinical practice. It is particularly useful to enhance student knowledge in the areas of patient positioning, exposure factor selection and radiographic image appraisal.(c) 2022 The College of Radiographers.

TI A Chemically Defined, Xeno- and Blood-Free Culture Medium Sustains
   Increased Production of Small Extracellular Vesicles From Mesenchymal
   Stem Cells
SO FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Cell therapy is witnessing a notable shift toward cell-free treatments based on paracrine factors, in particular, towards small extracellular vesicles (sEV), that mimic the functional effect of the parental cells. While numerous sEV-based applications are currently in advanced preclinical stages, their promised translation depends on overcoming the manufacturing hurdles posed by the large-scale production of purified sEV. Unquestionably, the culture medium used with the parental cells plays a key role in the sEV's secretion rate and content. An essential requisite is the use of a serum-, xeno-, and blood-free medium to meet the regulatory entity requirements of clinical-grade sEV's production. Here, we evaluated Oxium(TM)EXO, a regulatory complying medium, with respect to production capacity and conservation of the EV's characteristics and functionality and the parental cell's phenotype and viability. A comparative study was established with standard DMEM and a commercially available culture medium developed specifically for sEV production. Under similar conditions, Oxium(TM)EXO displayed a three-fold increase of sEV secretion, with an enrichment of particles ranging between 51 and 200 nm. These results were obtained through direct quantification from the conditioned medium to avoid the isolation method's interference and variability and were compared to the two culture media under evaluation. The higher yield obtained was consistent with several harvest time points (2, 4, and 6 days) and different cell sources, incluiding umbilical cord-, menstrual blood-derived mesenchymal stromal cells and fibroblasts. Additionally, the stem cell phenotype and viability of the parental cell remained unchanged. Furthermore, Oxium(TM)EXO-sEV showed a similar expression pattern of the vesicular markers CD63, CD9, and CD81, with respect to sEV derived from the other conditions. The in vitro internalization assays in different target cell types and the pharmacokinetic profile of intraperitoneally administered sEV in vivo indicated that the higher EV production rate did not affect the uptake kinetics or the systemic biodistribution in healthy mice. In conclusion, the Oxium(TM)EXO medium sustains an efficient and robust production of large quantities of sEV, conserving the classic functional properties of internalization into acceptor target cells and biodistribution in vivo, supplying the amount and quality of EVs for the development of cell-free therapies.

TI Lung cancer screening implementation: Complexities and priorities
SO RESPIROLOGY
AB Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer death worldwide. The benefits of lung cancer screening to reduce mortality and detect early-stage disease are no longer in any doubt based on the results of two landmark trials using LDCT. Lung cancer screening has been implemented in the US and South Korea and is under consideration by other communities. Successful translation of demonstrated research outcomes into the routine clinical setting requires careful implementation and co-ordinated input from multiple stakeholders. Implementation aspects may be specific to different healthcare settings. Important knowledge gaps remain, which must be addressed in order to optimize screening benefits and minimize screening harms. Lung cancer screening differs from all other cancer screening programmes as lung cancer risk is driven by smoking, a highly stigmatized behaviour. Stigma, along with other factors, can impact smokers' engagement with screening, meaning that smokers are generally 'hard to reach'. This review considers critical points along the patient journey. The first steps include selecting a risk threshold at which to screen, successfully engaging the target population and maximizing screening uptake. We review barriers to smoker engagement in lung and other cancer screening programmes. Recruitment strategies used in trials and real-world (clinical) programmes and associated screening uptake are reviewed. To aid cross-study comparisons, we propose a standardized nomenclature for recording and calculating recruitment outcomes. Once participants have engaged with the screening programme, we discuss programme components that are critical to maximize net benefit. A whole-of-programme approach is required including a standardized and multidisciplinary approach to pulmonary nodule management, incorporating probabilistic nodule risk assessment and longitudinal volumetric analysis, to reduce unnecessary downstream investigations and surgery; the integration of smoking cessation; and identification and intervention for other tobacco related diseases, such as coronary artery calcification and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. National support, integrated with tobacco control programmes, and with appropriate funding, accreditation, data collection, quality assurance and reporting mechanisms will enhance lung cancer screening programme success and reduce the risks associated with opportunistic, ad hoc screening. Finally, implementation research must play a greater role in informing policy change about targeted LDCT screening programmes.

TI Circular and long non-coding RNAs and their role in ophthalmologic
   diseases
SO ACTA BIOCHIMICA POLONICA
AB Long non-coding RNAs are >200-nucleotide-long RNA molecules which lack or have limited protein-coding potential. They can regulate protein formation through several different mechanisms. Similarly, circular RNAs are reported to play a critical role in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Changes in the expression pattern of these molecules are known to underlie various diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular, neurological and immunological disorders (Rinn & Chang, 2012; Sun & Kraus, 2015). Recent studies suggest that they are differentially expressed both in healthy ocular tissues as well as in eye pathologies, such as neovascularization, proliferative vit-reoretinopathy, glaucoma, cataract, ocular malignancy or even strabismus (Li et al., 2016). Aetiology of ocular diseases is multifactorial and combines genetic and environmental factors, including epigenetic and non-coding RNAs. In addition, disorders like diabetic retinopathy or age-related macular degeneration lack biomarkers for early detection as well as effective treatment methods that would allow controlling the disease progression at its early stages. The newly discovered non-coding RNAs seem to be the ideal candidates for novel molecular markers and therapeutic strategies. In this review, we summarized the current knowledge about gene expression regulators - long non-coding and circular RNA molecules in eye diseases.

TI The Latest Overview of circRNA in the Progression, Diagnosis, Prognosis,
   Treatment, and Drug Resistance of Hepatocellular Carcinoma
SO FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
AB Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the main causes of tumor-related deaths worldwide. Due to the lack of obvious early symptoms and the lack of sensitive screening indicators in the early stage of HCC, the vast majority of patients are diagnosed with advanced or metastatic HCC, resulting in dissatisfactory treatment result. Therefore, it is urgent to determine effective and sensitive diagnostic and prognostic indicators and to determine new therapeutic targets. Circular RNA (circRNA) is a type of non-coding RNA that has been neglected for a long time. In recent years, it has been proved to play an important role in the development of many human diseases. Increasing evidence shows that change in circRNA expression has an extensive effect on the biological behavior of HCC. In this study, we comprehensively tracked the latest progress of circRNA in the pathogenesis of HCC, and reviewed its role as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis prediction in patients with HCC. In addition, we also summarized the potential of circRNA as therapeutic target in HCC and its relationship with HCC drug resistance, providing clues for the clinical development of circRNA-based therapeutic strategies.

TI Long-term quality of life, sexual health and gastrointestinal function
   following colorectal cancer resection in an Asian cohort
SO COLORECTAL DISEASE
AB Aim As populations age and cancer management improves, long-term survivorship and quality-of-life (QOL) outcomes are becoming equally important as oncological results. Data from Asian populations are scarce. We aimed to evaluate the sexual health, gastrointestinal function and QOL amongst colorectal cancer survivors in a tertiary referral centre in Singapore. Method Adults who had undergone elective curative surgery for non-metastatic colorectal cancer at least 2 years prior were included. Exclusion criteria were cognitive disease, serious postoperative complications or recurrent cancer. Participants were invited to complete the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaires EORTC-QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CR29. Using multiple bivariate analysis, r scores were used to examine relationship trends between QOL domains and survivor sociodemographic and disease-specific characteristics. Results From February 2017 to July 2019, 400 responses were recorded. Median age and follow-up duration were 64 years (range 32-90) and 78 months (interquartile range 49-113) respectively. Patients who had Stage III cancer had better overall QOL scores compared to Stage I/II. Rectal (vs. colon) cancer negatively influenced sexual health and gastrointestinal function, but did not appear to affect overall QOL. Amongst our cohort, 57% (n = 129) of men and 43% (n = 75) of women were sexually active. Markers of socioeconomic status, including employment, education and housing type, were found to significantly impact perception of various aspects of QOL. Conclusion Knowledge of factors which influence well-being can identify individuals who may benefit from tailored management strategies. Regular patient-doctor contact may play a role in building and maintaining positive perspectives of cancer survivors.

TI Development and evaluation of the psychometric properties of the
   caregiver burden scale for parents of children who stutter (CBS-PCWS)
SO JOURNAL OF FLUENCY DISORDERS
AB Purpose: Caring for a child who stutters can impose excessive pressure on parents. Caregiver burden affects many aspects of parents' lives. Paying attention to parents in the treatment of children who stutter (CWS) is important because parents play a key role in the treatment of CWS. The aim of the study was to develop the Caregiver Burden Scale for Parents of Children Who Stutter (CBS-PCWS) and investigate the psychometric properties of the CBS-PCWS.
   Method: The CBS-PCWS was developed using interviews with 15 parents of CWS and a literature review. The content validity, face validity, construct validity using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and reliability of the CBS-PCWS were investigated. The content validity was evaluated using 10 experts' opinions. Face validity was determined using interviews with 10 parents of CWS. The reliability of the CBS-PCWS was evaluated through internal consistency and test-retest reliability.
   Results: The scale development resulted in the creation of 137 items. During an expert panel with the presence of the research team, 51 similar items were eliminated. During the qualitative content validity stage, nine items were added to the initial scale. After determining the content and face validity, the number of CBS-PCWS items was reduced to 52 items. In the construct validity stage using EFA with responses from 364 parents, eight items of the CBS-PCWS were removed due to low factor loadings. The results of the EFA indicated that the CBS-PCWS contained five factors: psychological and emotional, personal and physical, support for caregiving, culpability, and socio-communicative. The Cronbach's alpha values of the scale domains were in the 0.78-0.94 range. In addition, the ICC test-retest coefficient for the total score of the CBS-PCWS was 0.93 and for its domains was in 0.91-0.99 range.
   Conclusion: The CBS-PCWS has 44 items with five domains and is a valid and reliable scale that can be used for clinical or research purposes. More studies are required to evaluate further psychometric properties of the CBS-PCWS.

TI The succession of the plant community on a decontaminated radioactive
   meadow site
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY
AB Long-term observation of the succession in a plant community is considered a fundamental unit used to investigate the expected consequences of soil contamination by radionuclides and to understand restoration of technogeneously disturbed ecosystems. The development of arboreal willow meadow under remediation of a radioactively contaminated site has been studied for half a century. Succession stages in the formation of the de novo community were noted. Changes in the floristic composition, soil structure as well as radionuclide activity concentrations in topsoil were registered on each step.
   Technical recultivation of the area including covering radioactive wastes with a mixture of sand and gravel led to lower the radiation levels and was suitable for decontamination during first 5-8 years. This allowed the community to develop with maximal effectiveness on the initial steps. Than the covering layer lost its barrier functions but no adverse effects at dose rates up to 150 mu Gy/h on completion of the community formation were registered.
   Radioecological conditions and changes in the plant community development were registered simultaneously on the area studied that makes possible to follow main doseforming radionuclides migration and to determine main steps of the succession.
   The study results is a practical demonstration that edaphic niches, climatic conditions and coenotic relationships between plants play a more important role in the evolution of the studied community than the contamination type and radiation exposure levels.

TI The Biological Flora of Coastal Dunes and Wetlands: Retama monosperma
   (L.) Boiss.
SO JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
AB Retama monosperma (L.) Boiss. (white bridal broom) is a legume shrub that establishes mainly on coastal sands and dunes in zones under a Mediterranean climate. The species is able to tolerate salt spray, high temperatures of substrate and air, and low levels of soil nutrients and humidity. It is important in middle stages of dune succession, functioning as a key species in structuring the plant community, and it can play an important role in geomorphology. Retama monosperma enriches soil with N and other nutrients, ameliorates the typical harsh environmental conditions in dunes for other plants, and provides refuge and food for wildlife and forage for livestock. Leaves fall rapidly after emergence, and gas exchange is carried out in photosynthetic stems (cladodes), thereby reducing salt-induced stress. Some compounds isolated from the species show potential in pharmacological applications. It has high fruit production and effective associated seed dispersers. Recently, it has been reported that R. monosperma displays invasive behaviour in coastal areas in different parts of the world, including within its natural range, showing potential to negatively affect singular and protected coastal dune flora. Here we present a summary of the biology of R. monosperma.

TI A Plastid-Localized Pentatricopeptide Repeat Protein is Required for
   Both Pollen Development and Plant Growth in Rice
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Several mitochondrial-targeted pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins involved in pollen development have been reported to be fertility restorer (Rf) proteins. However, the roles of plastid-localized PPR proteins in plant male reproduction are poorly defined. Here, we described a plastid-localized PPR-SMR protein, OsPPR676, which is required for plant growth and pollen development in rice. In this study, OsPPR676 was confirmed to be an interacted protein with Osj10gBTF3, beta-subunit of nascent polypeptide-associated complex (beta-NAC), by bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, indicating that both proteins are probably involved in the same regulatory pathway of pollen development. Compared with other chloroplast-rich tissues, OsPPR676 was only weakly expressed in anther, but in the Mei and YM stages of pollen development, its expression was relatively strong in the tapetum. Disruption of OsPPR676 resulted in growth retardation of plants and partial sterility of pollens. Phenotypic analysis of different osppr676 mutant lines implied that the SMR domain was not essential for the function of OsPPR676. We further demonstrated that OsPPR676 is essential for production of plastid atpB subunit, and then plays crucial roles in biosynthesis of fatty acids, carbohydrates, and other organic matters via affecting activity of ATP synthase.

TI The pattern of expression and prognostic value of key regulators for
   m(7)G RNA methylation in hepatocellular carcinoma
SO FRONTIERS IN GENETICS
AB N7-methylguanosine (m(7)G) modification on internal RNA positions plays a vital role in several biological processes. Recent research shows m(7)G modification is associated with multiple cancers. However, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), its implications remain to be determined. In this place, we need to interrogate the mRNA patterns for 29 key regulators of m(7)G RNA modification and assess their prognostic value in HCC. Initial, the details from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database concerning transcribed gene data and clinical information of HCC patients were inspected systematically. Second, according to the mRNA profiles of 29 m(7)G RNA methylation regulators, two clusters (named 1 and 2, respectively) were identified by consensus clustering. Furthermore, robust risk signature for seven m(7)G RNA modification regulators was constructed. Last, we used the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset to validate the prognostic associations of the seven-gene risk signature. We figured out that 24/29 key regulators of m(7)G RNA modification varied remarkably in their grades of expression between the HCC and the adjacent tumor control tissues. Cluster one compared with cluster two had a substandard prognosis and was also positively correlated with T classification (T), pathological stage, and vital status (fustat) significantly. Consensus clustering results suggested the expression pattern of m(7)G RNA modification regulators was correlated with the malignancy of HCC strongly. In addition, cluster one was extensively enriched in metabolic-related pathways. Seven optimal genes (METTL1, WDR4, NSUN2, EIF4E, EIF4E2, NCBP1, and NCBP2) were selected to establish the risk model for HCC. Indicating by further analyses and validation, the prognostic model has fine anticipating command and this probability signature might be a self supporting presage factor for HCC. Finally, a new prognostic nomogram based on age, gender, pathological stage, histological grade, and prospects were established to forecast the prognosis of HCC patients accurately. In essence, we detected association of HCC severity and expression levels of m(7)G RNA modification regulators, and developed a risk score model for predicting prognosis of HCC patients' progression.

TI Paip1 affects breast cancer cell growth and represents a novel
   prognostic biomarker
SO HUMAN PATHOLOGY
AB Polyadenylate-binding protein-interacting protein 1 (Paipl) regulates translational initiation. Increasing evidence suggests that Paipl plays important roles in cancer development and progression. This study explored the role of Paipl in breast cancer progression and evaluated its prognostic value. The cellular location of Paipl protein was determined using immunofluorescence. Then, Paip1 protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining in 119 breast cancers and 40 normal breast tissues. The correlation between Paipl expression and the clinicopathologic features of breast cancer was evaluated using the chi(2) test, and differences in survival curves were analyzed using log-rank tests. The role of Paipl in breast cancer proliferation and cell cycle progression was identified by siRNA transfection. Paip1 was expressed mainly in the cytoplasm of cancer cells and tissues. Expression was observed in 60.5% of the breast cancers (72/119), which was significantly higher than in normal breast tissues (17.5%; 7/40). High expression of Paipl protein was associated with high histologic grade, late clinical stage, and a low survival rate. Multivariate analysis indicated that Paip1 was an independent prognostic factor. Additionally, Paipl depletion by RNAi significantly decreased cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that Paipl promotes the growth of breast cancers and could be a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI p44/42MAPK and p90RSK modulate response in Apostichopus japonicus
SO COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR
   BIOLOGY
AB Reversible protein phosphorylation (RPP) plays a key role in signal transduction, enzyme activity and metabolic maintenance in response to extreme changes in the environment. In this study, we identified 55 phosphorylated proteins in Apostichopus japonicus coelomocytes by iTRAQ analysis, and sixteen proteins displayed differently expressed profiles between thermal stressed and control groups. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPI() signaling cascade was further characterized by Western blot. Spatial expression analysis revealed that phospho-p44/42MAPK levels were mainly detected in coelomocytes and muscle, and no signal in intestine and respiratory trees, although the protein were constitutively expressed in all examined tissues. Time-course expression analysis shown that the amount of phospho-p44/42MAPK( decreased by 57-60% in coelomocytes and 29-40% in muscle in acute exposure stage of 20 degrees C and 25 degrees C, respectively. In higher temperature remaining stage, phospho-p44/42MAPK was both induced with 1.7-fold increase at 20 degrees C and 52-fold at 25 degrees C at the first 12 h in coelomocytes, which was consistent with the change of p44/42MAPK. Similarly, 2.5-fold and 2.7-fold increases were detected in muscle at corresponding exposure temperature. In contrast, the p44/42MAPK in muscle showed depressed expression profiles. As time progressed, phospho-p44/42MAPK levels were all decreased significantly both in coelomocytes and in muscles. A reduction in phosphorylation levels was detected at 84 h in 20 degrees C exposed coelomocytes with 0.42-fold decrease, and at 36 h in 25 degrees C challenged muscle by 0.80-fold decrease. Correlated expression profiles between phospho-p90RSK and phospho-p44/42MAPK suggest that p44/42MAPK may be involved in temperature-induced metabolic suppression through targeting p90RSK in A. japonicus.

TI Identification and Verification of m(7)G Modification Patterns and
   Characterization of Tumor Microenvironment Infiltration via Multi-Omics
   Analysis in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma
SO FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
AB The epigenetic modification of tumorigenesis and progression in neoplasm has been demonstrated in recent studies. Nevertheless, the underlying association of N7-methylguanosine (m(7)G) regulation with molecular heterogeneity and tumor microenvironment (TME) in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) remains unknown. We explored the expression profiles and genetic variation features of m(7)G regulators and identified their correlations with patient outcomes in pan-cancer. Three distinct m(7)G modification patterns, including MGCS1, MGCS2, and MGCS3, were further determined and systematically characterized via multi-omics data in ccRCC. Compared with the other two subtypes, patients in MGCS3 exhibited a lower clinical stage/grade and better prognosis. MGCS1 showed the lowest enrichment of metabolic activities. MGCS2 was characterized by the suppression of immunity. We then established and validated a scoring tool named m7Sig, which could predict the prognosis of ccRCC patients. This study revealed that m(7)G modification played a vital role in the formation of the tumor microenvironment in ccRCC. Evaluating the m(7)G modification landscape helps us to raise awareness and strengthen the understanding of ccRCC's characterization and, furthermore, to guide future clinical decision making.

TI Functions of circular RNAs and their potential applications in gastric
   cancer
SO EXPERT REVIEW OF GASTROENTEROLOGY & HEPATOLOGY
AB Introduction: In recent years, circular RNAs (circRNAs) have emerged in the field of RNA research and their biological functions are now being gradually identified. circRNAs are divided into three categories: exonic circular RNAs (ecircRNAs), exon-intron circular RNAs (EIciRNAs), and intronic circular RNAs (ciRNAs). The circular structure of circRNAs confers unique biological characteristics upon them, such as enhanced stability over linear RNAs. Areas covered: circRNAs function to competitively bind with microRNAs (miRNAs) and proteins, participate in protein coding, regulate transcription, and form pseudogenes after reverse transcription. In gastric cancer, the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA axis is the most studied mechanisms underlying gastric cancer occurrence and development. Some specific and sensitive circRNAs, such as hsa_circ_102958, hsa_circ_0000520, and hsa_circ_0001017 may have potential diagnostic potential in early-stage gastric cancer. Abnormal expression of some circRNAs, including circ-LMTK2, circ-PSMC3, and circ-DLST are associated with the development of gastric cancer. Other circRNAs, such as hsa_circ_0001368, circ-ZFR, and circ-ERBB2, may also play important roles in gastric cancer treatment. Expert opinion: Exploring the roles of circRNAs in gastric cancer occurrence and development will help us to elucidate the functions of circRNAs and develop potential tools for early diagnosis and effective treatment of gastric cancer.

TI Notch1 primes CD4 T cells for T helper type I differentiation through
   its early effects on miR-29
SO MOLECULAR IMMUNOLOGY
AB The transmembrane receptor, Notch1 plays an important role during the differentiation of CD4 T cells into T helper (Th) subsets in the presence of appropriate cytokines, including differentiation into Th1 cells. MicroRNAs have also been shown to be important regulators of immune responses, including negatively regulating cytokine production by Th1 cells. The miR-29 family of microRNAs can act to inhibit tbx21 and ifng transcription, two important pro-inflammatory genes that are abundantly expressed in Th1 cells. Here we show that Notch1 may prime CD4 T cells to be responsive to Th1-polarizing cues through its early repressive effects on the miR-29 family of microRNAs. Using a combination of cell lines and primary cells, we demonstrate that Notch1 can repress miR-29a, miR-29b, and miR-29c transcription through a mechanism that is independent of NF-kappa B. We further show that this repression is mediated by canonical Notch signaling and requires active Mastermind like (MAML) 1, but this process is superseded by positive regulation of miR-29 in response to IFN gamma at later stages of CD4 T cell activation and differentiation. Collectively, our data suggest an additional mechanism by which Notch1 signaling may fine-tune Th1 cell differentiation.

TI Genome-wide identification m(6)A modified circRNAs revealed their key
   roles in skin ulceration syndrome disease development in Apostichopus
   japonicus
SO FISH & SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY
AB Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are novel endogenous non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and can be acted as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) to regulate microRNA (miRNA) and downstream gene expression. Recently, m6A modification has been found in circRNA, and m6A circRNAs also play important roles in various biological processes and a variety of diseases. Our previous study had been demonstrated that circRNAs were differentially expressed in skin ulceration syndrome (SUS) diseased sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus. However, whether the function of circRNAs are dependent on m6A levels are largely unknown. Here, we firstly investigated the genome-wide map of m6A circRNAs in sea cucumbers with different stages of Vibrio splendidus challenge, that's Control group, SUS-diseased group, and SUS-resistant group. MeRIP-seq revealed that m6A abundances were enriched in circRNAs in all three groups, especially for SUS-resistant group. Among them, more than 62% of modified circRNAs harbor only a single m6A peak and about 55% of m6A sites in circRNAs were derived from sense overlapping in each group. After V. splendidus infection, we found that most of m6A peaks in circRNAs were upregulated and less were downregulated in both SUS-diseased and SUS-resistant groups when compared with Control. Furthermore, GO analysis indicated that the host genes of circRNAs with dysregulated m6A peaks in SUS-diseased and SUS-resistant groups were both mainly enriched in the adhesion pathway. More importantly, we discovered that more than 50% m6A circRNAs showed a positive correlation between the circRNAs expression and m6A methylation levels both in SUS-diseased and SUS-resistant groups. Therefore, a core circRNA-miRNAmRNA (ceRNA) network whether influenced by m6A modification was constructed based on conjoint analysis. Our results indicated that several selected m6A circRNAs bind with miRNAs were mainly targeting to ubiquitylation system and adhesion pathway. What's more, three candidate m6A circRNAs and three target genes were validated by MeRIP-qPCR and qPCR, whose m6A levels in circRNA and mRNA expressions were consistent with disease occurrence or disease resistance. All of our current findings suggested that m6A circRNAs could play important roles during pathogen infection and might be served as a new molecular biomarker in SUS disease diagnose of A. japonicus.

SO GENETICS AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB N6-methyl-adenosine (m6A) methylation is one of the most common and abundant modifications of RNA molecules in eukaryotes. Although various biological roles of m6A methylation have been elucidated, its role in embryonic development is still unclear. In this review, we focused on the function and expression patterns of m6A-related genes in mammalian embryonic development and the role of m6A modification in the embryonic epigenetic reprogramming process. The modification of m6A is regulated by the combined activities of methyltransferases, demethylases, and m6A-binding proteins. m6A-related genes act synergistically to form a dynamic, reversible m6A pattern, which exists in several physiological processes in various stages of embryonic development. The lack of one of these enzymes affects embryonic m6A levels, leading to abnormal embryonic development and even death. Moreover, m6A is a positive regulator of reprogramming to pluripotency and can affect embryo reprogramming by affecting activation of the maternal-to-zygotic transition. In conclusion, m6A is involved in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic development and the metabolic processes of RNA and plays an important role in the epigenetic modification of embryos.

TI Jurgis Baltrusaitis - Between East and West?
SO SLOVAK REVIEW OF WORLD LITERATURE RESEARCH
AB Why Jurgis Baltrusaitis (1873-1944) - between East and West? Jurgis Baltrusaitis, a Lithuanian poet, a translator, an editor, a diplomat, a significant figure at the turn of the centuries in the Russian cultural milieu, represents a migrating author in the sense of his intentional programmatic dual domicile or biliterariness. This dioceism makes Baltrusaitis' relationship with the Russian and European modernism complicated, in which there is expressed the unique confrontation of the impulses of the European modernism (concretized also by significant translational activities), of Russian literary and extraliterary (cultural- philosophical, theatrical, musical and fine art) concepts and traditions in Lithuanian culture, its myths, legends, archetypes and emblems. If the words "Between East and West" in the title are followed by a question mark, it refers to the problematization of a thus formulated perception of the author in the sense of translational and editorial activities through the prism of his works. The basic East-West trajectory can be in the relation to Baltrusaitis' Lithuanian origin and to the province of his translational and editorial activities extended to the North-South trajectory. The North is represented mostly by the reflected and translated works of Scandinavian philosophers, thinkers, dramatists and prose writers, the South by the Italian element, which noticeably divides the typically modernistic diapason of the "West-European" impulses in the Russian environment - the French and the German. The almost depersonalized epicality, the emphasized cyclic turns and analogy between the natural and the human remain the characteristic features of symbolist artists (Baltrusaitis and the painter M. K. Ciurlionis). Typical is for modernism their "national" dual domicile, since both were "dual domiciliary" in the sense of another modernistic phenomenon - the creative movement within several artistic fields, (Ciurlionis - fine art, music, literature Baltrusaitis - literature, translation, theatre). Besides literature, Baltrusaitis belonged among outstanding personalities also in theatre: he organized Russian theatrical events, well-known are his activities associated with Komissarzevskaya Drama Theatre and with his guest tours in West-European countries - and on the other hand his mediated role in the cooperation of D. Craig with Russian cultural environment. The fundamentals of the poet's concept of the lyrical subject are built on the mutual relationships between the world and the character. The outer world "enters" Baltrusaitis' poetry only by causing the emotion, the subsequent thought and the image, evoked by this thought; the lyrical subject becomes explicit only in select moments -"migy vremeni". The aim of the study was to clarify Baltrusaitis' position between the East and the West in the time of its natural integration in the Russian cultural and literary course of events.

TI Targeting circular RNAs as a therapeutic approach: current strategies
   and challenges
SO SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION AND TARGETED THERAPY
AB Significant progress has been made in circular RNA (circRNA) research in recent years. Increasing evidence suggests that circRNAs play important roles in many cellular processes, and their dysregulation is implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases. CircRNAs are highly stable and usually expressed in a tissue- or cell type-specific manner. Therefore, they are currently being explored as potential therapeutic targets. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches are typically performed using circRNA expression plasmids and RNA interference-based strategies, respectively. These strategies have limitations that can be mitigated using nanoparticle and exosome delivery systems. Furthermore, recent developments show that the cre-lox system can be used to knockdown circRNAs in a cell-specific manner. While still in the early stages of development, the CRISPR/Cas13 system has shown promise in knocking down circRNAs with high specificity and efficiency. In this review, we describe circRNA properties and functions and highlight their significance in disease. We summarize strategies that can be used to overexpress or knockdown circRNAs as a therapeutic approach. Lastly, we discuss major challenges and propose future directions for the development of circRNA-based therapeutics.

TI A rice mTERF protein V14 sustains photosynthesis establishment and
   temperature acclimation in early seedling leaves
SO BMC PLANT BIOLOGY
AB Background: Plant mitochondrial transcription termination factor (mTERF) family members play important roles in development and stress tolerance through regulation of organellar gene expression. However, their molecular functions have yet to be clearly defined.
   Results: Here an mTERF gene V14 was identified by fine mapping using a conditional albino mutant v14 that displayed albinism only in the first two true leaves, which was confirmed by transgenic complementation tests. Subcellular localization and real-time PCR analyses indicated that V14 encodes a chloroplastic protein ubiquitously expressed in leaves while spiking in the second true leaf. Chloroplastic gene expression profiling in the pale leaves of v14 through real-time PCR and Northern blotting analyses showed abnormal accumulation of the unprocessed transcripts covering the rpoB-rpoC1 and/or rpoC1-rpoC2 intercistronic regions accompanied by reduced abundance of the mature rpoC1 and rpoC2 transcripts, which encode two core subunits of the plastid-encoded plastid RNA polymerase (PEP). Subsequent immunoblotting analyses confirmed the reduced accumulation of RpoC1 and RpoC2. A light-inducible photosynthetic gene psbD was also found down-regulated at both the mRNA and protein levels. Interestingly, such stage-specific aberrant posttranscriptional regulation and psbD expression can be reversed by high temperatures (30 similar to 35 degrees C), although V14 expression lacks thermo-sensitivity. Meanwhile, three V14 homologous genes were found heat-inducible with similar temporal expression patterns, implicating their possible functional redundancy to V14.
   Conclusions: These data revealed a critical role of V14 in chloroplast development, which impacts, in a stage-specific and thermo-sensitive way, the appropriate processing of rpoB-rpoC1-rpoC2 precursors and the expression of certain photosynthetic proteins. Our findings thus expand the knowledge of the molecular functions of rice mTERFs and suggest the contributions of plant mTERFs to photosynthesis establishment and temperature acclimation.

TI CATHERINE THE GREAT'S BYZANTIUM
SO QUAESTIO ROSSICA
AB Catherine II inspired many Russian projects in historical studies. She herself was an active, if amateur, historian. The empress eagerly used history to promote her own political ideas and was an avid reader of history, both Russian and ancient. But what about Byzantine history? One would think she would have been interested in it as well, since between the late 1770s and the early 1790s, Catherine was enraptured by a plan to dismember the Ottoman Empire and recreate Byzantium with the capital in Constantinople. In her view, her youngest grandson (born in 1779) was to rule this future empire and was deliberately named Konstantin. This "Greek Project", broadly regarded to have been the main thrust of Russian foreign policy for fifteen years, had very solid cultural "wrappings" such as architectural projects, poetry, drama, paintings, medals, etc. The author examines whether this campaign was accompanied by a deeper interest in and knowledge of the history of the Byzantium that Catherine wanted to revive. The author concludes that the empress did not bother to learn anything about this great civilization. Byzantine history, apart from Russo-Byzantine relations, did not become a subject of scholarly research during her reign. Catherine herself began reading Edward Gibbon's The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, but gave it up on the eighth volume of its French translation, thus going no further than the fifth century, when Byzantium proper was just emerging. In her play Oleg's Early Rule, she demonstrated complete ignorance of Byzantine history, culture, court ceremonies, etc. Finally, numerous and blatant errors in the "Byzantine" parts of her Notes on Russian History suggest that Catherine had no interest in or "a big picture" of Byzantine history. Only once in this extensive book, and even then only in a footnote, do we suddenly come across a very precise, thoughtful, and detailed description of Byzantine facts, namely, of the Varangian guards at the imperial court of Constantinople. This suggests that when Catherine deemed a subject important, she was able to find exhaustive information on any "Byzantine" question. Yet, of all things Byzantine, Catherine showed interest in only one issue, and that was because it concerned the "Norman question", a highly sensitive topic in her time and ever since. Otherwise, the empress remained completely indifferent to Byzantium. It can be surmised that Catherine never saw the "Greek Project" as a practical task of recreating a real state with its distinct laws, officials, territorial division and, finally, church.

TI "Is this our boasted constitution? Is this our liberty?": Reading Milton
   in Ireland
SO LITERATURE COMPASS
AB This essay examines a largely undocumented aspect of Irish literary history: the reception and circulation of John Milton's writings in Ireland. Milton's negative views of the inhabitants of Ireland have been well documented, but this essay analyses some of the intellectual responses of readers, writers, and thinkers in Ireland to the English republic's leading apologist for the conquest of Ireland. I argue that such an approach is required in order to redirect the critical narrative away from examinations of the hackneyed anti-Irish stereotypes written for colonial agendas and to shed light on the ways in which Milton was read to speak to and about a range of political, religious, social, and ethical issues in early modern and late modern Ireland. The essay also seeks to introduce my book-length study of the topic which, ranging across printed and manuscript sources-from Irish translations of Milton's poetry to political appropriations of his controversial prose-interrogates the collective assumptions, aspirations, fears, anxieties, and prejudices of readers and writers in Ireland as they are revealed in response to the self-conflicting voice of civil and religious liberties, on the one hand, and aggressive English colonialism on the other.

TI Wrath of God: religious primes and punishment
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB Recent evidence indicates that priming participants with religious concepts promotes prosocial sharing behaviour. In the present study, we investigated whether religious priming also promotes the costly punishment of unfair behaviour. A total of 304 participants played a punishment game. Before the punishment stage began, participants were subliminally primed with religion primes, secular punishment primes or control primes. We found that religious primes strongly increased the costly punishment of unfair behaviours for a subset of our participants-those who had previously donated to a religious organization. We discuss two proximate mechanisms potentially underpinning this effect. The first is a 'supernatural watcher' mechanism, whereby religious participants punish unfair behaviours when primed because they sense that not doing so will enrage or disappoint an observing supernatural agent. The second is a 'behavioural priming' mechanism, whereby religious primes activate cultural norms pertaining to fairness and its enforcement and occasion behaviour consistent with those norms. We conclude that our results are consistent with dual inheritance proposals about religion and cooperation, whereby religions harness the byproducts of genetically inherited cognitive mechanisms in ways that enhance the survival prospects of their adherents.

TI Natural variations of SLG1 confer high-temperature tolerance in indica
   rice
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB With global warming and climate change, breeding crop plants tolerant to high-temperature stress is of immense significance. tRNA 2-thiolation is a highly conserved form of tRNA modification among living organisms. Here, we report the identification of SLG1 (Slender Guy 1), which encodes the cytosolic tRNA 2-thiolation protein 2 (RCTU2) in rice. SLG1 plays a key role in the response of rice plants to high-temperature stress at both seedling and reproductive stages. Dysfunction of SLG1 results in plants with thermosensitive phenotype, while overexpression of SLG1 enhances the tolerance of plants to high temperature. SLG1 is differentiated between the two Asian cultivated rice subspecies, indica and japonica, and the variations at both promoter and coding regions lead to an increased level of thiolated tRNA and enhanced thermotolerance of indica rice varieties. Our results demonstrate that the allelic differentiation of SLG1 confers indica rice to high-temperature tolerance, and tRNA thiolation pathway might be a potential target in the next generation rice breeding for the warming globe. Understanding the mechanism of high-temperature tolerance will help to breed crops adaptive to warming climate. Here, the authors show SLG1, a cytosolic tRNA 2-thiolation protein 2 encoding gene, is differentiated between the two Asian cultivated rice subspecies and confers high temperature tolerance of indica rice.

TI Cyclin-dependent kinase 11(p110) (CDK11(p110)) is crucial for human
   breast cancer cell proliferation and growth
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) play important roles in the development of many types of cancers by binding with their paired cyclins. However, the function of CDK11 larger protein isomer, CDK11(p110), in the tumorigenesis of human breast cancer remains unclear. In the present study, we explored the effects and molecular mechanisms of CDK11(p110) in the proliferation and growth of breast cancer cells by determining the expression of CDK11(p110) in breast tumor tissues and examining the phenotypic changes of breast cancer cells after CDK11(p110) knockdown. We found that CDK11(p110) was highly expressed in breast tumor tissues and cell lines. Tissue microarray analysis showed that elevated CDK11(p110) expression in breast cancer tissues significantly correlated with poor differentiation, and was also associated with advanced TNM stage and poor clinical prognosis for breast cancer patients. In vitro knockdown of CDK11(p110) by siRNA significantly inhibited cell growth and migration, and dramatically induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Flow cytometry demonstrated that cells were markedly arrested in G1 phase of the cell cycle after CDK11(p110) downregulation. These findings suggest that CDK11(p110) is critical for the proliferation and growth of breast cancer cells, which highlights CDK11(p110) may be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of breast cancer.

TI miR-631 Inhibits Intrahepatic Metastasis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma by
   Targeting PTPRE
SO FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to play critical roles in the pathological development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most common cancers in the world. Our study aims to explore the expression, function and mechanism of miR-631 in HCC. Our findings are that expression of miR-631 is significantly down-regulated in HCC tissue compared with that in adjacent non-cancerous tissue, and low expression of miR-631 in HCC tissue is associated with cirrhosis, multiple tumors, incomplete tumor encapsulation, poor tumor differentiation, and high TNM stage. Our test results showed that miR-631 could inhibit migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and intrahepatic metastasis of HCC. Receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase epsilon (PTPRE) as a downstream target of miR-631 could promote migration, invasion and EMT of HCC cells. Besides, the expression of PTPRE had a negative correlation with the expression of miR-631 both in vivo and in vitro, and increasing expression of PTPRE could reverse inhibitory effects of miR-631 in HCC cells. In sum, our study first demonstrated that miR-631 targeted PTPRE to inhibit intrahepatic metastasis in HCC. We gain insights from these findings into the mechanism of miRNAs regulation in HCC metastasis and further introduce a novel therapeutic target for HCC treatment.

TI Interaction between Phage T4 Protein RIII and Host Ribosomal Protein S1
   Inhibits Endoribonuclease RegB Activation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB Lytic viruses of bacteria (bacteriophages, phages) are intracellular parasites that take over hosts' biosynthetic processes for their propagation. Most of the knowledge on the host hijacking mechanisms has come from the studies of the lytic phage T4, which infects Escherichia coli. The integrity of T4 development is achieved by strict control over the host and phage processes and by adjusting them to the changing infection conditions. In this study, using in vitro and in vivo biochemical methods, we detected the direct interaction between the T4 protein RIII and ribosomal protein S1 of the host. Protein RIII is known as a cytoplasmic antiholin, which plays a role in the lysis inhibition function of T4. However, our results show that RIII also acts as a viral effector protein mainly targeting S1 RNA-binding domains that are central for all the activities of this multifunctional protein. We confirm that the S1-RIII interaction prevents the S1-dependent activation of endoribonuclease RegB. In addition, we propose that by modulating the multiple processes mediated by S1, RIII could act as a regulator of all stages of T4 infection including the lysis inhibition state.

TI Content based video retrieval using dynamic textures
SO MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
AB In recent days, design of smart city applications is attracting several researchers offering improvised services to citizens through efficient management of day to day life activities such as business, safety, public utility, transportation and hospitality etc. In most of the smart city applications video retrieval plays crucial role. Through implementation of video retrieval we can achieve several smart city innovates such as monitoring of traffic or crowd etc. The existing video retrieval system depends on either ontological concepts or training based concepts. Implementation of ontological concepts has shown drawbacks such as miss-assignment of tags to the database videos leads to poor efficiency and also needs huge manual effort for the purpose of onnotation. Training based concepts needs prior knowledge and also takes more time for the purpose of training and to overcome all these drawbacks content based video retrieval systems (CBVR) has been evolved. In most of the existing CBVR systems the principal challenge is semantic gap between the user defined rich semantics and the system defined low level features of the scene. In the present article, we propose an algorithm of CBVR using dynamic textures. Statistical textures with the inclusion of motion of the pattern, change in illumination of the pattern, intrinsic change to the pattern becomes dynamic textures. Dynamic textures are best suited to videos containing moving objects. In this article, LBP-TOP a variant of dynamic texture has been used as a feature for video retrieval. LBP-TOP has the capability of jointly describing motion and appearance features. The LBP-TOP features are invariant to illumination, rotation and local translation. These significant benefits support the use of LBP-TOP in the proposed method. The proposed method uses query video clip, which consists randomly selected ten example frames. The proposed CBVR has three stages offline processing, online processing, a matching & retrieval stage. In offline processing, we extract keyframes of database videos using Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and Color Moments (CM) and then LBP-TOP feature of keyframes have been extracted and used to represent entire database video. In online processing, we extract LBP-TOP features of query video and then these features will be given as input to matching & retrieval stage where, we calculate euclidean distance between LBP-TOP features of database keyframes and query video frames to retrieve videos with less distance. To prove effectiveness of the proposed method it have been tested on 108 videos of standard traffic dataset which is available publicly and compared with the other state-of-the-art methods, both qualitatively and quantitavely. Quantitative performance evaluation has been carried out using the evaluation parameters: Precision, Recall, Jaccard Index, Accuracy, Specificity and E-measure. Both qualitative and quantitative performance show that the proposed method performed well than the other state-of-the-art methods, and success of the proposed method lies under incorporation of dynamic textures. The proposed algorithm can be used in real-time applications like traffic monitoring. The proposed CBVR system can be used to monitor traffic through feature matching between query scene and the database video. If the query is matched with low traffic video of database then the algorithm displays output as low traffic time. In similar manner, medium traffic or heavy traffic times will be detected by the algorithm.

TI RNA Epigenetics in Chronic Lung Diseases
SO GENES
AB Chronic lung diseases are highly prevalent worldwide and cause significant mortality. Lung cancer is the end stage of many chronic lung diseases. RNA epigenetics can dynamically modulate gene expression and decide cell fate. Recently, studies have confirmed that RNA epigenetics plays a crucial role in the developing of chronic lung diseases. Further exploration of the underlying mechanisms of RNA epigenetics in chronic lung diseases, including lung cancer, may lead to a better understanding of the diseases and promote the development of new biomarkers and therapeutic strategies. This article reviews basic information on RNA modifications, including N-6 methylation of adenosine (m(6)A), N-1 methylation of adenosine (m(1)A), N-7-methylguanosine (m(7)G), 5-methylcytosine (m(5)C), 2 ' O-methylation (2 '-O-Me or Nm), pseudouridine (5-ribosyl uracil or psi), and adenosine to inosine RNA editing (A-to-I editing). We then show how they relate to different types of lung disease. This paper hopes to summarize the mechanisms of RNA modification in chronic lung disease and finds a new way to develop early diagnosis and treatment of chronic lung disease.

SO FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR BIOSCIENCES
AB In their initial stages of discovery, prokaryotic toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems were confined to bacterial plasmids where they function to mediate the maintenance and stability of usually low-to medium-copy number plasmids through the post-segregational killing of any plasmid-free daughter cells that developed. Their eventual discovery as nearly ubiquitous and repetitive elements in bacterial chromosomes led to a wealth of knowledge and scientific debate as to their diversity and functionality in the prokaryotic lifestyle. Currently categorized into six different types designated types I VI, type II TA systems are the best characterized. These generally comprised of two genes encoding a proteic toxin and its corresponding proteic antitoxin, respectively. Under normal growth conditions, the stable toxin is prevented from exerting its lethal effect through tight binding with the less stable antitoxin partner, forming a non-lethal TA protein complex. Besides binding with its cognate toxin, the antitoxin also plays a role in regulating the expression of the type II TA operon by binding to the operator site, thereby repressing transcription from the TA promoter. In most cases, full repression is observed in the presence of the TA complex as binding of the toxin enhances the DNA binding capability of the antitoxin. TA systems have been implicated in a gamut of prokaryotic cellular functions such as being mediators of programmed cell death as well as persistence or dormancy, biofilm formation, as defensive weapons against bacteriophage infections and as virulence factors in pathogenic bacteria. It is thus apparent that these antitoxins, as DNA-binding proteins, play an essential role in modulating the prokaryotic lifestyle whilst at the same time preventing the lethal action of the toxins under normal growth conditions, i.e., keeping the proverbial wolves at bay. In this review, we will cover the diversity and characteristics of various type II TA antitoxins. We shall also look into some interesting deviations from the canonical type II TA systems such as tripartite TA systems where the regulatory role is played by a third party protein and not the antitoxin, and a unique TA system encoding a single protein with both toxin as well as antitoxin domains.

TI The 5BSL3.2 Functional RNA Domain Connects Distant Regions in the
   Hepatitis C Virus Genome
SO FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB Viral genomes are complexly folded entities that carry all the information required for the infective cycle. The nucleotide sequence of the RNA virus genome encodes proteins and functional information contained in discrete, highly conserved structural units. These so-called functional RNA domains play essential roles in the progression of infection, which requires their preservation from one generation to the next. Numerous functional RNA domains exist in the genome of the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Among them, the 5BSL3.2 domain in the cis-acting replication element (CRE) at the 3 0 end of the viral open reading frame has become of particular interest given its role in HCV RNA replication and as a regulator of viral protein synthesis. These functionalities are achieved via the establishment of a complex network of long-distance RNA-RNA contacts involving (at least as known to date) the highly conserved 3 ' X tail, the apical loop of domain IIId in the internal ribosome entry site, and/or the so-called Alt region upstream of the CRE. Changing contacts promotes the execution of different stages of the viral cycle. The 5BSL3.2 domain thus operates at the core of a system that governs the progression of HCV infection. This review summarizes our knowledge of the long-range RNA-RNA interaction network in the HCV genome, with special attention paid to the structural and functional consequences derived from the establishment of different contacts. The potential implications of such interactions in switching between the different stages of the viral cycle are discussed.

TI Y-PATHS: A Conceptual Framework for Classifying the Timing, How, and
   Setting of Youth Physical Activity
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY & HEALTH
AB Background: Multiple models and frameworks exist for the measurement and classification of physical activity in adults that are applied broadly across populations but have limitations when applied to youth. The authors propose a conceptual framework specifically designed for classifying youth physical activity. Methods: The Youth Physical Activity Timing, How, and Setting (Y-PATHS) framework is a conceptualization of the when (timing), how, and where (setting) of children's and adolescents' physical activity patterns. The authors developed Y-PATHS using the design thinking process, which includes 3 stages: inspiration, ideation, and implementation. Results: The Y-PATHS includes 3 major components (timing, how, and setting) and 13 subcomponents. Timing subcomponents include (1) school days: in-school, (2) school days: out-of-school, and (3) non-school days. How subcomponents include: (1) functional, (2) transportation, (3) organized, and (4) free play. Setting subcomponents include: (1) natural areas, (2) schools, (3) home, (4) recreational facilities, (5) shops and services, and (6) travel infrastructure. Conclusions: The Y-PATHS is a comprehensive classification framework that can help researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to better understand youth physical activity. Specifically, Y-PATHS can help to identify the domains of youth physical activity for surveillance and research and to inform the planning/evaluation of more comprehensive physical activity programming.

TI Structural record of Lower Miocene westward motion of the Alboran Domain
   in the Western Betics, Spain
SO TECTONOPHYSICS
AB In the framework of the Africa-Europe convergence, the Mediterranean system presents a complex interaction between subduction rollback and upper-plate deformation during the Tertiary. The western end of the system shows a narrow arcuate geometry across the Gibraltar arc, the Betic-Rif belt, in which the relationship between slab dynamics and surface tectonics is not well understood. The present study focuses on the Western Betics, which is characterized by two major thrusts: 1) the Internal/External Zone Boundary limits the metamorphic domain (Alboran Domain) from the fold-and-thrust belts in the External Zone; 2) the Ronda Peridotites Thrust allows the juxtaposition of a strongly attenuated lithosphere section with large bodies of sub-continental mantle rocks on top of upper crustal rocks. New structural data show that two major E-W strike-slip corridors played a major role in the deformation pattern of the Alboran Domain, in which E-W dextral strike-slip faults, N60 degrees thrusts and N140 degrees normal faults developed simultaneously during dextral strike-slip simple shear. Olistostromic sediments of Lower Miocene age were deposited and deformed in this tectonic context and hence provide an age estimate for the inferred continuous westward translation of the Alboran Domain that is accommodated by an E-W lateral (strike-slip) ramp and a N60 degrees frontal thrust. The crustal emplacement of large bodies of sub-continental mantle may occur at the onset of this westward thrusting in the Western Alboran domain. At lithosphere-scale, we interpret the observed deformation pattern as the subduction upper-plate expression of a lateral slab tear and its westward propagation since the Lower Miocene.

TI A-to-I mRNA editing in fungi: occurrence, function, and evolution
SO CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR LIFE SCIENCES
AB A-to-I RNA editing is an important post-transcriptional modification that converts adenosine (A) to inosine (I) in RNA molecules via hydrolytic deamination. Although editing of mRNAs catalyzed by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism in metazoans, organisms outside the animal kingdom lacking ADAR orthologs were thought to lack A-to-I mRNA editing. However, recent discoveries of genome-wide A-to-I mRNA editing during the sexual stage of the wheat scab fungus Fusarium graminearum, model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, Sordaria macrospora, and an early diverging filamentous ascomycete Pyronema confluens indicated that A-to-I mRNA editing is likely an evolutionarily conserved feature in filamentous ascomycetes. More importantly, A-to-I mRNA editing has been demonstrated to play crucial roles in different sexual developmental processes and display distinct tissue- or development-specific regulation. Contrary to that in animals, the majority of fungal RNA editing events are non-synonymous editing, which were shown to be generally advantageous and favored by positive selection. Many non-synonymous editing sites are conserved among different fungi and have potential functional and evolutionary importance. Here, we review the recent findings about the occurrence, regulation, function, and evolution of A-to-I mRNA editing in fungi.

TI Cooperativity between the Ribosome-Associated Chaperone Ssb/RAC and the
   Ubiquitin Ligase Ltn1 in Ubiquitination of Nascent Polypeptides
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB Eukaryotic cells have evolved multiple mechanisms to detect and eliminate aberrant polypeptides. Co-translational protein surveillance systems play an important role in these mechanisms. These systems include ribosome-associated protein quality control (RQC) that detects aberrant nascent chains stalled on ribosomes and promotes their ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome, and ribosome-associated chaperone Ssb/RAC, which ensures correct nascent chain folding. Despite the known function of RQC and Ssb/ribosome-associated complex (RAC) in monitoring the quality of newly generated polypeptides, whether they cooperate during initial stages of protein synthesis remains unexplored. Here, we provide evidence that Ssb/RAC and the ubiquitin ligase Ltn1, the major component of RQC, display genetic and functional cooperativity. Overexpression of Ltn1 rescues growth suppression of the yeast strain-bearing deletions of SSB genes during proteotoxic stress. Moreover, Ssb/RAC promotes Ltn1-dependent ubiquitination of nascent chains associated with 80S ribosomal particles but not with translating ribosomes. Consistent with this finding, quantitative western blot analysis revealed lower levels of Ltn1 associated with 80S ribosomes and with free 60S ribosomal subunits in the absence of Ssb/RAC. We propose a mechanism in which Ssb/RAC facilitates recruitment of Ltn1 to ribosomes, likely by detecting aberrations in nascent chains and leading to their ubiquitination and degradation.

TI Public health education for parents during the outbreak of COVID-19: a
   rapid review
SO ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
AB Background: It is well-known that public health education plays a crucial role in the prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases, but how health providers should advise families and parents to obtain health education information is a challenging question. With coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreading around the world, this rapid review aims to answer that question and thus to promote evidence-based decision making in health education policy and practice.
   Methods: We systematically searched the literature on health education during COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemics in Medline (via PubMed), Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, China Biology Medicine disc (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang Data from their inception until March 31, 2020. The potential bias of the studies was assessed by Joanna Briggs Institute Prevalence Critical Appraisal Tool.
   Results: Of 1,067 papers found, 24 cross-sectional studies with a total of 35,967 participants were included in this review. The general public lacked good knowledge of SARS and MERS at the early stage of epidemics. Some people's knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of COVID-19 had been improved, but the health behaviors of some special groups including children and their parents need to be strengthened. Negative emotions including fear and stigmatization occurred during the outbreaks. Reliable health information was needed to improve public awareness and mental health for infectious diseases. Health information from nonprofit, government and academic websites was more accurate than privately owned commercial websites and media websites.
   Conclusions: For educating and cultivating children, parents should obtain information from the official websites of authorities such as the World Health Organization ( WHO) and national Centers for Disease Control, or from other sources endorsed by these authorities, rather than from a general search of the internet or social media.

TI Integrated Analysis of the Functions and Prognostic Values of
   RNA-Binding Proteins in Colorectal Cancer
SO FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors. Selecting effective treatment for CRC patients, especially in the early stages, remains a challenge because of the lack of adequate biomarkers. Recent evidence suggests that RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play a vital role in development and progression of carcinogenesis. However, their mechanisms in cancer progression are still limited. The role of RBPs in CRC has been poorly understood. There were 1,542 reported RBPs analyzed between CRC tissues and normal tissues using the Wilcoxon test to identify differentially expressed RBPs (DE RBPs). Then, the potential functions and the prognostic value of these DE RBPs were explored through systematic bioinformatics analysis. There were 177 DE RBPs identified between CRC tissues and normal tissues. A protein-protein interaction network was constructed based on DE RBPs, and critical modules were screened. A regulatory network between prognostic DE RBPs and differentially expressed transcription factors was constructed. Besides, a risk signature was built based on prognostic DE RBPs, which is able to predict overall survival of CRC patients with high accuracy. In conclusion, the results provided a comprehensive understanding of the functions of RBPs in CRC, as well as an RBP-related prognostic signature.

TI YTHDF2 Is Downregulated in Response to Host Shutoff Induced by DNA Virus
   Infection and Regulates Interferon-Stimulated Gene Expression
SO JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
AB Recent studies have begun to reveal the complex and multifunctional roles of N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) modifications and their associated writer, reader, and eraser proteins in infection by diverse RNA and DNA viruses. However, little is known about their regulation and functions during infection by several viruses, including poxviruses. Here, we show that members of the YTH Domain Family (YTHDF), in particular YTHDF2, are downregulated as the prototypical poxvirus, vaccinia virus (VacV) enters later stages of replication in a variety of natural target cell types, but not in commonly used transformed cell lines wherein the control of YTHDF2 expression appears to be dysregulated. YTHDF proteins also decreased at late stages of infection by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) but not human cytomegalovirus, suggesting that YTHDF2 is downregulated in response to infections that induce host shutoff. In line with this idea, YTHDF2 was potently downregulated upon infection with a VacV mutant expressing catalytically inactive forms of the decapping enzymes, D9 and D10, which fails to degrade dsRNA and induces a protein kinase R response that itself inhibits protein synthesis. Overexpression and RNAi-mediated depletion approaches further demonstrate that YTHDF2 does not directly affect VacV replication. Instead, experimental downregulation of YTHDF2 or the related family member, YTHDF1, induces a potent increase in interferon-stimulated gene expression and establishes an antiviral state that suppresses infection by either VacV or HSV-1. Combined, our data suggest that YTHDF2 is destabilized in response to infection-induced host shutoff and serves to augment host antiviral responses.IMPORTANCE There is increasing recognition of the importance of N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) modifications to both viral and host mRNAs and the complex roles this modification plays in determining the fate of infection by diverse RNA and DNA viruses. However, in many instances, the functional contributions and importance of specific m(6)A writer, reader, and eraser proteins remains unknown. Here, we show that natural target cells but not transformed cell lines downregulate the YTH Domain Family (YTHDF) of m(6)A reader proteins, in particular YTHDF2, in response to shutoff of protein synthesis upon infection with the large DNA viruses, vaccinia virus (VacV), or herpes simplex virus type 1. We further reveal that YTHDF2 downregulation also occurs as part of the host protein kinase R response to a VacV shutoff mutant and that this downregulation of YTHDF family members functions to enhance interferon-stimulated gene expression to create an antiviral state.

TI Trial collaborators' perceptions of the process of delivering Healthy
   Beginnings advice via telephone calls or text messages
SO HEALTH PROMOTION JOURNAL OF AUSTRALIA
AB Issue addressed One in four Australian children aged between the ages of two and four are affected by overweight. In New South Wales, the Communicating Healthy Beginnings Advice by Telephone (CHAT) trial delivered an intervention to pregnant women and women with infants via telephone calls and text messages. The focus of the intervention was on infant feeding and establishing healthy habits for infants by building the capacity of mothers. This study investigates trial collaborators' perspectives concerning the implementation of this intervention, to obtain insights that will support future translation and scale-up. Methods This research was undertaken during the intervention phase of the trial. Twenty trial collaborators involved in the planning, implementation or delivery of the CHAT trial were invited to participate. Qualitative interviews were conducted with collaborators using open-ended questions based on Steckler and Linnan's process evaluation framework and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Inductive thematic analysis was employed to identify themes from the interview data. Results Fourteen trial collaborators were interviewed. Collaborators included child and family health nurses (intervention providers), nurse managers with extensive child and family health nursing experience, a paediatrician, dietitians, health promotion experts, health service managers, health and nursing executives, program personnel (project coordinator, research fellow and evaluation officer) and university researchers. Following coding of qualitative data, themes were realised from the data as a result of active co-production on the part of the researcher. Five themes were identified: (a) context (organisational support, engagement and partnerships, communication and project leadership); (b) program receipt, benefit and reach; (c) program delivery (intervention providers' experience and skills, mode of intervention delivery, referral to other services, support and training for intervention providers); (d) implementation (program delivered as planned); (e) opportunities for scale-up. Collaborators perceived that the program was implemented and delivered as planned. This specific research addresses the success of the process of implementing and delivering interventions for infant feeding and establishing healthy habits for children by building the capacity of mothers. Collaborators attributed successful program implementation to contextual factors: strong support by the host organisation; good project leadership; clear communication; collaborative internal and external partnerships; intervention provision by experienced nurses. Remote delivery was convenient to program participants and participants were able to resolve other personal concerns in addition to direct immediate benefits. Because of their capacity to influence policy decisions, the absence of policymakers at project meetings was a shortcoming. Collaborative partnerships with health and research partners, understanding of contextual issues and consumer involvement could lead to program expansion. The program has the potential to be scaled up through integration with existing services and gradual expansion into other health districts prior to state-wide rollout. Conclusions The CHAT trial delivered the Healthy Beginnings intervention which resulted in improvements in infant feeding, active play and sedentary behaviours.
   This evaluation demonstrated that the involvement of key stakeholders from early planning stages through to implementation of the program and the partnerships that evolved contributed to the successful implementation of the program. An unintended benefit to participants from this program was the social support that was provided. Intervention delivery via telephone and text messages enabled easy access to the program. Most importantly, the program has the potential to be scaled up through integration into existing services and gradual expansion prior to state-wide rollout. So what? Strong internal and external partnerships, effective communication systems and integration with existing services create the context for potential translation and scaling up of the program to other health promotion settings.

TI Post-transcriptional regulation of C-C motif chemokine ligand 2
   expression by ribosomal protein L22 during LPS-mediated inflammation
SO FEBS JOURNAL
AB Monocyte infiltration to the site of pathogenic invasion is critical for inflammatory response and host defence. However, this process demands precise regulation as uncontrolled migration of monocytes to the site delays resolution of inflammation and ultimately promotes chronic inflammation. C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) plays a key role in monocyte migration, and hence, its expression should be tightly regulated. Here, we report a post-transcriptional regulation of CCL2 involving the large ribosomal subunit protein L22 (RPL22) in LPS-activated, differentiated THP-1 cells. Early events following LPS treatment include transcriptional upregulation of RPL22 and its nuclear accumulation. The protein binds to the first 20 nt sequence of the 5 ' UTR of ccl2 mRNA. Simultaneous nuclear translocation of up-frameshift-1 protein and its interaction with RPL22 results in cytoplasmic degradation of the ccl2 mRNA at a later stage. Removal of RPL22 from cells results in increased expression of CCL2 in response to LPS causing disproportionate migration of monocytes. We propose that post-transcriptional regulation of CCL2 by RPL22 fine-tunes monocyte infiltration during a pathogenic insult and maintains homeostasis of the immune response critical to resolution of inflammation.

TI Circular RNA involvement in aging: An emerging player with great
   potential
SO MECHANISMS OF AGEING AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Circular RNA (circRNA) is a class of newly discovered noncoding RNA (ncRNA), presenting as a special covalent loop without a 5' cap or 3' tail. Multiple biological properties of circRNA have been revealed during the past decades, such as widespread expression, high conservation, cell-specificity, tissue-specificity and developmental stage-specific expression patterns, as well as resistance to RNase R digestion. CircRNA also exhibits diverse biological functions, including regulation of host genes, alternative splicing, miRNA sponges, protein traps and even protein synthesis. Recently, a global accumulation of circRNAs during aging has been identified across different species, indicating a potential role as a causal factor in aging and age-related disease. The high stability could be one of the mechanisms contributing to this phenomenon. CircRNA could play a role in aging, such as neural aging, muscle aging, reproductive aging, skin aging, immunosenescence, visual aging and age-related diseases like Alzheimer's disease, via interaction with miRNAs, RNA binding proteins, modulation of parental gene transcription, mainly at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. The present study will focus on the advancement of circRNA regarding aging and age-related diseases. We will also discuss the biogenesis, properties, biological functions, and the perspectives of circRNA.

TI The germ cell-specific RNA binding protein RBM46 is essential for
   spermatogonial differentiation in mice
SO PLOS GENETICS
AB Author summaryMale fertility relies upon continuous daily production of millions of fertilization-competent sperm. These sperm are created in the testis during spermatogenesis, the developmental program founded upon spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). SSCs divide to produce progeny spermatogonia that either remain in the stem cell pool or commit to differentiate and enter meiosis and ultimately form sperm. The balance between stem cell self-renewal and production of gametes is controlled by changes in the expression of a large complement of genes. An emerging concept in control over gene expression is the essential role of proteins that bind to mRNAs and regulate their stability, storage, and/or translation into proteins. Here, we identify such an RNA binding protein-RBM46 -that is only expressed in the male and female germline and required for gamete production and thus fertility in both sexes. In male mice with a specific deletion of Rbm46, spermatogenesis is arrested at spermatogonial differentiation. RBM46 binds a specific cohort of mRNAs encoding factors essential for differentiation and meiosis, and is thus positioned to play a critical role in post-transcriptional control over gene expression in mammalian spermatogonia.
   Control over gene expression is exerted, in multiple stages of spermatogenesis, at the post-transcriptional level by RNA binding proteins (RBPs). We identify here an essential role in mammalian spermatogenesis and male fertility for 'RNA binding protein 46' (RBM46). A highly evolutionarily conserved gene, Rbm46 is also essential for fertility in both flies and fish. We found Rbm46 expression was restricted to the mouse germline, detectable in males in the cytoplasm of premeiotic spermatogonia and meiotic spermatocytes. To define its requirement for spermatogenesis, we generated Rbm46 knockout (KO, Rbm46(-/-)) mice; although male Rbm46(-/-) mice were viable and appeared grossly normal, they were infertile. Testes from adult Rbm46(-/-) mice were small, with seminiferous tubules containing only Sertoli cells and few undifferentiated spermatogonia. Using genome-wide unbiased high throughput assays RNA-seq and 'enhanced crosslinking immunoprecipitation' coupled with RNA-seq (eCLIP-seq), we discovered RBM46 could bind, via a U-rich conserved consensus sequence, to a cohort of mRNAs encoding proteins required for completion of differentiation and subsequent meiotic initiation. In summary, our studies support an essential role for RBM46 in regulating target mRNAs during spermatogonia differentiation prior to the commitment to meiosis in mice.

TI Iterative Development of a Mobile Phone App to Support Community Health
   Volunteers During Cervical Cancer Screening in Western Kenya:
   Qualitative Study
SO JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH
AB Background: To achieve the World Health Organization targets for cervical cancer elimination, low- and middle-income countries will need to develop innovative strategies to provide human papillomavirus (HPV)-based screening at a population level. Although mobile health (mHealth) interventions may help realize these goals by filling gaps in electronic specimen tracking and patient education, effective implementation of mHealth interventions is dependent upon context-specific development that is acceptable and usable by the target population. Detailed feedback should be gathered at the design and development stages to yield final products that reflect the needs, desires, and capabilities of target users.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to develop an mHealth app (mSaada) to support HPV-based screening in partnership with community health volunteers (CHVs) and program planners in western Kenya.
   Methods: A team of student programmers developed a prototype to meet previously identified gaps in screening: patient education, protocol support, data capture, and specimen tracking. The prototype was iteratively developed through 2 waves of in-person working sessions with quantitative (survey) and qualitative (in-depth interview) feedback. Research staff engaged key stakeholders from both urban and rural locations and with varying levels of experience in delivering screening services. During the sessions, participants completed simulation exercises and role-play activities to become familiar with the platform. Once feedback was gathered and synthesized after each wave of in-person data collection, developers implemented changes to improve mSaada functionality.
   Results: A total of 18 CHVs and clinicians participated in the in-person sessions. Participants found mSaada useful, easy to use, and would meet the needs of CHVs to provide HPV-based cervical cancer screening (electronic data capture, client education resources, and specimen tracking). They provided key feedback to enhance user experience, workflow, and sustainability. Key changes included altering the appearance of the wireframes, adding translation in additional local languages, changing potentially insensitive figures, alphabetizing lengthy dropdown menus, adding clinically relevant logic checks when entering data, and incorporating the ability to make real time edits to client records. They also made recommendations for additional features that might enhance mSaada's impact at the facility and health system levels, specifically the inclusion of a report-generating tool consistent with the Ministry of Health standards.
   Conclusions: Using a process of iterative feedback with key stakeholders and rapid response from developers, we have developed a mobile app ready for pilot testing in HPV-based screening programs led by CHVs.

TI Ultrastructural Characterization of Turnip Mosaic Virus-Induced Cellular
   Rearrangements Reveals Membrane-Bound Viral Particles Accumulating in
   Vacuoles
SO JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
AB Positive-strand RNA [(+) RNA] viruses remodel cellular membranes to facilitate virus replication and assembly. In the case of turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), the viral membrane protein 6K(2) plays an essential role in endomembrane alterations. Although 6K(2)-induced membrane dynamics have been widely studied by confocal microscopy, the ultrastructure of this remodeling has not been extensively examined. In this study, we investigated the formation of TuMV-induced membrane changes by chemical fixation and high-pressure freezing/freeze substitution (HPF/FS) for transmission electron microscopy at different times of infection. We observed the formation of convoluted membranes connected to rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) early in the infection process, followed by the production of single-membrane vesicle-like (SMVL) structures at the midstage of infection. Both SMVL and double-membrane vesicle-like structures with electron-dense cores, as well as electron-dense bodies, were found late in the infection process. Immunogold labeling results showed that the vesicle-like structures were 6K(2) tagged and suggested that only the SMVL structures were viral RNA replication sites. Electron tomography (ET) was used to regenerate a three-dimensional model of these vesicle-like structures, which showed that they were, in fact, tubules. Late in infection, we observed filamentous particle bundles associated with electron-dense bodies, which suggests that these are sites for viral particle assembly. In addition, TuMV particles were observed to accumulate in the central vacuole as membrane-associated linear arrays. Our work thus unravels the sequential appearance of distinct TuMV-induced membrane structures for viral RNA replication, viral particle assembly, and accumulation.
   IMPORTANCE
   Positive-strand RNA viruses remodel cellular membranes for different stages of the infection process, such as protein translation and processing, viral RNA synthesis, particle assembly, and virus transmission. The ultrastructure of turnip mosaic virus (TuMV)-induced membrane remodeling was investigated over several days of infection. The first change that was observed involved endoplasmic reticulum-connected convoluted membrane accumulation. This was followed by the formation of single-membrane tubules, which were shown to be viral RNA replication sites. Later in the infection process, double-membrane tubular structures were observed and were associated with viral particle bundles. In addition, TuMV particles were observed to accumulate in the central vacuole as membrane-associated linear arrays. This work thus unravels the sequential appearance of distinct TuMV-induced membrane structures for viral RNA replication, viral particle assembly, and accumulation.

TI Trypanosoma brucei Homologue of Regulator of Ribosome Synthesis 1 (Rrs1)
   Has Direct Interactions with Essential Trypanosome-Specific Proteins
SO MSPHERE
AB Studies in eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis have largely been performed in yeast, where they have described a highly complex process involving numerous protein and RNA components. Due to the complexity and crucial nature of this process, a number of checkpoints are necessary to ensure that only properly assembled ribosomes are released into the cytoplasm. Assembly of the 5S ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex is one of these checkpoints for late-stage 60S subunit maturation. Studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have identified the 5S rRNA and four proteins, L5, L11, Rpf2, and Rrs1, as comprising the ribosome-associated 5S RNP. Work from our laboratory has shown that in the eukaryotic pathogen Trypanosoma brucei, the 5S RNP includes trypanosome-specific proteins P34/P37, as well as homologues of L5, Rpf2, and 5S rRNA. In this study, we examine a homologue of Rrs1 and identify it as an additional member of the T. brucei 5S RNP. Using RNA interference, we show that TbRrs1 is essential for the survival of T. brucei and has an important role in ribosome subunit formation and, together with TbRpf2, plays a role in 25/28S and 5.8S rRNA processing. We further show that TbRrs1 is a member of the T. brucei 5S RNP through the identification of novel direct interactions with P34/P37 and 5S rRNA as well as with TbL5 and TbRpf2. These unique characteristics of TbRrs1 highlight the importance of studying ribosome biogenesis in the context of diverse organisms and identify interactions that could be targeted for future drug development.
   IMPORTANCE Trypanosoma brucei is a parasite responsible for human and animal African trypanosomiasis. Current treatments for these diseases have numerous problems, and the development of novel chemotherapeutics can be achieved by identifying targets that are parasite specific and part of essential processes. Ribosome biogenesis is the process of generating translation-competent ribosomes and is critical for survival in all organisms. Work from our laboratory has shown that the formation of the 5S RNP, a crucial checkpoint in ribosome biogenesis, requires trypanosomespecific proteins P34/P37 and homologues of Rpf2 and L5 which possess parasitespecific characteristics. In this study, we characterize TbRrs1, an additional member of the T. brucei 5S RNP, and show that it is essential for parasite survival and has unique interactions with P34/P37 and 5S rRNA. This expands our understanding of the 5S RNP in T. brucei and identifies new targets for future drug development.

AB From novel to film: no Disgrace for JM Coetzee. An investigation into the process of film adaptation
   Adaptations of literary works have always played a prominent role in the history of film. However, these adaptations were always judged by literary critics from the perspective of their own literary prejudices. This necessarily led to the film as genre being seen as inferior to the literary genre. Against this backdrop one may make the assumption that, should film narrative be defined from within a literary domain, the film will, based on its own unique characteristics, be secondary to the literary work on which it is based. This article does not aim to establish a hierarchy between the literary text and its film version, but intends to make the reader aware of a significant paradigm shift since the nineties as to the importance of film adaptation as an entity in its own right. To reach this point, however; the development of film adaptation is scrutinised from three seminal eras, namely: the era 1960-1990, characterised by so-called Fidelity criticism, the era 1990-2003, characterised by processes such as inter semiotic translation, and the era since 2003, characterised by the focus on a hermeneutic model. The film adaptation of Nobel prize winner J M Coetzee's novel Disgrace, directed and produced by Steve Jacobs with Anna-Maria Monticelli as screenwriter and co-producer, comes under scrutiny. It is discussed as an adaptation that may be interpreted by using Linda Cahir's (2006) criteria for the creation and interpretation of film adaptations.
   This article will argue that literature does not exist in a vacuum and is constantly being rewritten through the various cultural contexts wherein it exists. The study of the film adaptation of Disgrace shows how popular cultural literary adaptations can function as living texts which become part of organic, meaningful processes in the community.

TI Are Nursing Interventions Effective in Improving Quality of Life in
   Cancer Survivors? A Systematic Review
SO CANCER NURSING
AB Background Cancer survivors (CSs) have needs that can negatively impact their quality of life (QoL). Oncology nurses play a key role in providing comprehensive care in cancer survivorship, although little is known about their impact on health outcomes. Objective The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of nursing interventions to improve QoL and satisfaction with care of CSs. Methods A systematic review was conducted. PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Cochrane databases were searched for experimental studies. The Joanna Briggs Institute Checklist for Randomized Controlled Trials was used to verify the quality of the studies (Prospero reference: CRD42020148294). Results Of the 8 clinical trials eligible for inclusion, 5 demonstrated that interventions conducted by nurses improved the overall QoL or some of its domains in CSs. The included studies focused on short-term survival; no studies in long-term CSs were identified. Two studies assessed satisfaction with care of survivors, obtaining positive results. Conclusions Nursing interventions seem to improve the QoL of short-term CSs. However, because of the low number of studies identified, the findings of this systematic review should be interpreted with caution. Implications for practice Further studies are necessary to strengthen the implementation of effective nursing intervention in cancer practice. Research should particularly be conducted with long-term CSs as there is lack of data on this specific stage of cancer.

TI The integrated stress response mediates necrosis in murine Mycobacterium
   tuberculosis granulomas
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION
AB The mechanism by which only some individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis develop necrotic granulomas with progressive disease while others form controlled granulomas that contain the infection remains poorly defined. Mice carrying the sst1-suscepible (sst1S) genotype develop necrotic inflammatory lung lesions, similar to human tuberculosis (TB) granulomas, which are linked to macrophage dysfunction, while their congenic counterpart (B6) mice do not. In this study we report that (a) sst1S macrophages developed aberrant, biphasic responses to TNF characterized by superinduction of stress and type I interferon pathways after prolonged TNF stimulation; (b) the late-stage TNF response was driven via a JNK/IFN-beta/protein kinase R (PKR) circuit; and (c) induced the integrated stress response (ISR) via PKR-mediated eIF2 alpha phosphorylation and the subsequent hyperinduction of ATF3 and ISR-target genes Chac1, Trib3, and Ddit4. The administration of ISRIB, a small-molecule inhibitor of the ISR, blocked the development of necrosis in lung granulomas of M. tuberculosis-infected sst1(S) mice and concomitantly reduced the bacterial burden. Hence, induction of the ISR and the locked-in state of escalating stress driven by the type I IFN pathway in sst1S macrophages play a causal role in the development of necrosis in TB granulomas. Interruption of the aberrant stress response with inhibitors such as ISRIB may offer novel host-directed therapy strategies.

TI Characterization and expression of DDX6 during gametogenesis in the
   Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis
SO GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH
AB DDX6 belongs to a family of DEAD-box RNA helicases, which are RNA splicing proteins that ensure the correct folding and structure of mature RNA. Gametogenesis requires the participation of many kinds of RNA. To explore its functions during Eriocheir sinensis gametogenesis, we cloned a full-length DDX6 cDNA sequence from E. sinensis (Es-DDX6) which contains a 1536-nucleotide open reading frame encoding a 512-amino acid protein. Multiple sequence alignments showed that Es-DDX6 has ten conservative DEAD-box family motifs. Tissue expression analysis of Es-DDX6 mRNA and protein levels showed that Es-DDX6 was highly expressed in both the ovary and testis. qRT-PCR analysis revealed the widespread expression of Es-DDX6 mRNA during various stages of gonad development peaking in October. In addition, immunohistochemical studies showed that oocytes and the spermatogonium and primary spermatocytes of testes contained high levels of cytoplasmic Es-DDX6 and decreased expression levels in spermatids. Interestingly, there was no expression of Es-DDX6 in these cells as they matured along the male reproductive system. Since oocytes and spermatocytes are active in meiosis and oocytes undergo rapid growth in October, these results provide preliminary evidence that Es-DDX6 plays a role in E. sinensis gametogenesis and oocyte growth processes.

TI Prognostic values of m6A RNA methylation regulators in differentiated
   Thyroid Carcinoma
SO JOURNAL OF CANCER
AB N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent modification of RNA in mammals. m6A RNA methylation levels are dynamically regulated by m6A RNA methylation regulators. While increasing evidence has suggested that m6A RNA methylation is vital in the initiation and progression of human carcinoma, little is known about the expression and effect of m6A RNA methylation regulators in differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). Herein, we demonstrate that most of the thirteen main m6A RNA methylation regulators are differentially expressed in DTC tissues and normal thyroid tissues. Based on consensus clustering of m6A RNA methylation regulators, DTC cases were divided into two subgroups (TC1 and TC2). Compared with the TC1 subgroup, the TC2 subgroup was associated with a poorer prognosis, older age, higher T grade, higher N grade and higher TNM stage. The results indicated that alteration of m6A RNA methylation regulators was closely related to DTC. We further established a risk signature of four m6A RNA methylation regulators that could evaluate prognosis and clinicopathological features in DTC. Finally, the results of the TCGA analysis were verified by other cohorts from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. In conclusion, m6A RNA methylation regulators play a crucial part in the progression of DTC and are potentially useful for evaluating the prognosis and providing potential novel insights into treatment strategies.

AB mTOR is a serine-threonine kinase and participates in cell proliferation, cellular metabolism was found to be activated during Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral infection and replication. During viral replication mTOR, downstream target genes such as ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta 1 (S6K1) and Eukaryotic translational initiation factor 4E-binding protein1 (4-E-BP1) are activated result in ribosome biosynthesis and efficient protein synthesis. In plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), mTOR plays a key role in the association of adapter protein myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) and interferon regulatory factor (IRF-7) leading to the transcriptional activation of type-I interferon (IFN) genes. Viruses also inactivate the interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) pathway by impairing the IRF-7 mediated activation of IFN-alpha gene transcription. Thus, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors can help in suppressing the early stages of viral infection and replication. Interestingly, the key tumor-suppressor p53 protein will undergo degradation by virus-encoded E3 ubiquitin ligase Ring-finger and CHY zinc-finger domain-containing 1 (RCHY1) leading to an increased viral survival in host cells. Thus, the mTOR inhibitors and p53 activators or microRNAs that functions as p53 and can target 3 '-UTR of mTOR and RPS6KB1 might effectively inhibit viral replication in the human respiratory tract and lung cells.

TI Calreticulin regulates vascular endothelial growth factor-A mRNA
   stability in gastric cancer cells
SO PLOS ONE
AB Calreticulin (CRT) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) are crucial for angiogenesis, and mediate multiple malignant behaviors in gastric cancer. In this study, we report that CRT is positively correlated with VEGF-A in gastric cancer patients. Moreover, high expressions of both CRT and VEGF-A are markedly associated with the pathological stage, progression, and poor prognosis in the patients. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the mechanism by which CRT affects VEGF-A in gastric cancer. Firstly, we demonstrate the novel finding that knockdown of CRT reduced VEGF-A mRNA stability in two gastric cancer cell lines, AGS and MKN45. The AU-Rich element (ARE) is believed to play a crucial role in the maintenance of VEGF-A mRNA stability. Luciferase reporter assay shows that knockdown of CRT significantly decreased the activity of renilla luciferase with VEGF-A ARE sequence. Additionally, competition results from RNA-binding/electrophoretic mobility shift assay indicate that CRT forms an RNA-protein complex with the VEGF-A mRNA by binding to the ARE. In addition, the proliferation rate of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was significantly reduced when treated with conditioned medium from CRT knockdown cells; this was rescued by exogenous VEGF-A recombinant protein. Our results demonstrate that CRT is involved in VEGF-A ARE binding protein complexes to stabilize VEGF-A mRNA, thereby promoting the angiogenesis, and progression of gastric cancer.

TI Mitochondria dysfunction impairs Tribolium castaneum wing development
   during metamorphosis
SO COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY
AB The disproportionate growth of insect appendages such as facultative growth of wings and exaggeration of beetle horns are examples of phenotypic plasticity. Insect metamorphosis is the critical stage for development of pupal and adult structures and degeneration of the larval cells. How the disproportionate growth of external appendages is regulated during tissue remodeling remains unanswered. Tribolium castaneum is used as a model to study the function of mitochondria in metamorphosis. Mitochondrial dysfunction is achieved by the knockdown of key mitochondrial regulators. Here we show that mitochondrial function is not required for metamorphosis except that severe mitochondrial dysfunction blocks ecdysis. Surprisingly, various abnormal wing growth, including short and wingless phenotypes, are induced after knocking down mitochondrial regulators. Mitochondrial activity is regulated by IIS (insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling)/FOXO (forkhead box, sub-group O) pathway through TFAM (transcription factor A, mitochondrial). RNA sequencing and differential gene expression analysis show that wing-patterning and insect hormone response genes are downregulated, while programmed cell death and immune response genes are upregulated in insect wing discs with mitochondrial dysfunction. These studies reveal that mitochondria play critical roles in regulating insect wing growth by targeting wing development during metamorphosis, thus showing a novel molecular mechanism underlying developmental plasticity.
   Mitochondrial disruption in the red flour beetle leads to insects with three layers of cuticles (larval, pupal, and adult) and blocks the wing development.

TI miR-138-5p contributes to cell proliferation and invasion by targeting
   Survivin in bladder cancer cells
SO MOLECULAR CANCER
AB Background: Survivin (encoded by the gene BIRC5) plays an important role in the carcinogenesis of bladder cancer. Identifying miRNAs that target Survivin in the setting of bladder cancer will help to develop Survivin-based therapies for bladder cancer.
   Methods: The expression levels of miR-138-5p and Survivin protein were measured in 12 resected bladder cancer specimens. The correlation between miR-138-5p and Survivin was further examined by evaluating Survivin expression in human bladder cancer cell lines that either overexpressed or knocked down miR-138-5p. A luciferase reporter assay was performed to test the direct binding of miR-138-5p to the target gene BIRC5. We also investigated the biological role of miR-138-5p targeting to Survivin in bladder cancer cell lines both in vivo and in vitro.
   Results: In this study, we found that the Survivin protein was either absent or weakly expressed in normal adjacent tissues and consistently up-regulated in bladder cancer tissues; however, the mRNA levels did not vary as much, suggesting that a post-transcriptional mechanism was involved. Because microRNAs are powerful post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, we used bioinformatic analyses to search for microRNAs that could potentially target BIRC5 in the setting of bladder cancer. We identified 2 specific targeting sites for miR-138-5p in the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of BIRC5. We further identified an inverse correlation between miR-138-5p and Survivin protein levels in bladder cancer tissue samples. By overexpressing or knocking down miR-138-5p in bladder cancer cells, we experimentally confirmed that miR-138-5p directly recognizes the 3'-UTR of the BIRC5 transcript and regulates Survivin expression. Furthermore, the biological consequences of the targeting of BIRC5 by miR-138-5p were examined in vitro via cell proliferation and invasion assays and in vivo using a mouse xenograft tumor model. We demonstrated that BIRC5 repression by miR-138-5p suppressed the proliferative and invasive characteristics of bladder cancer cells and that miR-138-5p exerted an anti-tumor effect by negatively regulating BIRC5 in a xenograft mouse model.
   Conclusions: Taken together, our findings provide the first clues regarding the role of miR-138-5p as a tumor suppressor in bladder cancer by inhibiting BIRC5 translation.

TI Celebrating the Nation: 12 October, from "Day of the Race' to Spanish
   National Day
SO JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY HISTORY
AB This article is a study of the national holiday of 12 October, one of the most long-lasting and least transitory of the symbolic components of Spanish nationalism. Transnational in nature, this celebration of Spain's existence constitutes an exception among similar national holidays, in that it is based upon the country's role in the Americas and nostalgia for empire as founding elements of national identity. By analysing the changing ways in which this anniversary was celebrated in the course of the twentieth century, in rituals and language, the article highlights both the different imaginaries that were evoked and the roles played by particular actors and institutions in different stages of the construction of the national state and the definition of the regional and local identities of which it is composed. Our analysis of the progress of this celebration, from its inception in the late nineteenth century to the present day, as first Fiesta de la Raza, then Dia de la Hispanidad and now just National Day', suggests that its durability, which has been maintained for nearly a century, stems from the notably ductile nature of the myths associated with it. Adaptable to regimes and political challenges of varied kinds, this commemoration melds together the inheritance of liberalism, the national-Catholic tradition and regionalized nationalism', all of which have been key elements in Spanish political history in the twentieth century.

TI The m6A Methyltransferase METTL14-Mediated N6-Methyladenosine
   Modification of PTEN mRNA Inhibits Tumor Growth and Metastasis in
   Stomach Adenocarcinoma
SO FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
AB Background Stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) is a common reason for tumor-related fatalities globally, as it results in distant metastasis. Methyltransferase-like 14 (METTL14), a notable RNA N6-adenosine methyltransferase (m6A), plays a significant role in the growth of tumor through controlling the RNA working. This study aims to highlight METTL14 in STAD's biological function and molecular mechanism. Methods Bioinformatics and immunohistochemical (IHC) assays have been utilized for the detection of METTL14 expression in the STAD. METTL14's biological function has been shown while making use of HGC-27 and AGS cells in vitro experiments. MeRIP-qPCR and luciferase reporter assays were employed for the exploration of METTL14's mechanism modifying the target of phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN). Subcutaneous xeno transplantation model and STAD liver metastasis orthotopic tumor model were used to study METTL14 in STAD in vivo. Results METTL14 expression was substantially downregulated in STAD reflecting contribution to major tumors, progressed TNM stage as well as poor overall survival (OS) in STAD. Moreover, METTL14's inhibition of STAD cells proliferation, migration and invasion has been verified in vitro assays. Furthermore, an identification of PTEN being METTL14-mediated m6A modification's substrate has been made. METTL14's overexpression highly enhanced PTEN mRNA m6A variation, stabilized PTEN mRNA and increased protein expression. Further, it has been found out that METTL14-mediated STAD cells inhibition of proliferation and invasion dependent on PTEN. At last, we demonstrated that METTL14 inhibit STAD growth and metastasis in vivo models. Conclusions METTL14 inhibits tumor growth and metastasis of STAD via stabilization of PTEN mRNA expression. Therefore, METTL14 is a potential biomarker of prognosis and therapeutic targets for STAD.

TI Intra-articular injection of an antioxidant formulation did not improve
   structural degeneration in a rat model of post-traumatic osteoarthritis
SO JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC TRANSLATION
AB Background/objective: Oxidative stress plays an important role in osteoarthritis (OA), causing inflammation and matrix degradation in joints. Previous studies have shown that antioxidants such as quercetin and vitamin C are potential candidates for treating OA. We aimed to determine whether a formulation of quercetin and vitamin C, together with an iron chelator, could retard OA progression in a post-traumatic OA rat model.
   Methods: Twelve rats received anterior cruciate ligament transection for OA induction. At 20 weeks postoperation, weekly intra-articular injection of 50 mu L of either saline or a formulation of quercetin dehydrate, sodium-L-ascorbate, and deferoxamine mesylate was given consecutively for 4 weeks (n = 5). Gait analysis was performed at pretreatment, and at 1 week and 5 weeks post-treatment. Microcomputed tomography scanning and histological scoring were performed at 5 weeks post-treatment.
   Results: Gait analysis showed that intra-articular injections of antioxidant formulation did not improve pain-associated Limb Idleness Index over time (p = 0.449, Friedman test). However, at 5 weeks post-treatment, the treatment group exhibited a significantly lower Limb Idleness Index than the control group (p = 0.047, ManneWhitney U test). At 5 weeks post-treatment, microcomputed tomography analysis revealed that there was no difference in any parameter between the treatment and control groups (p > 0.05, Student t test). Severe OA histopathological changes were found in both groups. The Osteoarthritis Research Society International scores of the treatment and control groups were 20 (range, 20-26) and 20 (range, 9-26), respectively (p = 0.382, Mann-Whitney U test).
   Conclusion: Intra-articular injection of an antioxidant formulation containing quercetin, vitamin C, and deferoxamine did not retard OA progression in advanced-stage OA. Future studies should aim to determine whether giving antioxidants in early OA, with prolonged drug retention, would be effective in retarding OA progression. (C) 2016 The Authors.

TI A comprehensive repertoire of tRNA-derived fragments in prostate cancer
SO ONCOTARGET
AB Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer among men in developed countries. Although its genetic background is thoroughly investigated, rather little is known about the role of small non-coding RNAs (sncRNA) in this disease. tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) represent a new class of sncRNAs, which are present in a broad range of species and have been reported to play a role in several cellular processes. Here, we analyzed the expression of tRFs in fresh frozen patient samples derived from normal adjacent prostate and different stages of PCa by RNA-sequencing. We identified 598 unique tRFs, many of which are deregulated in cancer samples when compared to normal adjacent tissue. Most of the identified tRFs are derived from the 5'- and 3'-ends of mature cytosolic tRNAs, but we also found tRFs produced from other parts of tRNAs, including pre-tRNA trailers and leaders, as well as tRFs from mitochondrial tRNAs. The 5'-derived tRFs comprise the most abundant class of tRFs in general and represent the major class among upregulated tRFs. The 3'-derived tRFs types are dominant among downregulated tRFs in PCa. We validated the expression of three tRFs using qPCR. The ratio of tRFs derived from tRNA(LysCTT) and tRNA(PheGAA) emerged as a good indicator of progression-free survival and a candidate prognostic marker. This study provides a systematic catalogue of tRFs and their dysregulation in PCa and can serve as the basis for further research on the biomarker potential and functional roles of tRFs in this disease.

TI The YTH Domain Family of N6-Methyladenosine "Readers" in the Diagnosis
   and Prognosis of Colonic Adenocarcinoma
SO BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB To profile the landscape of methylation N-6 adenosine (m(6)A) RNA regulators in colonic adenocarcinoma (COAD) and to explore potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, we assessed the differential expression patterns of m(6)A RNA methylation regulators between 418 COAD patients and 41 controls based on profiling from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. We plotted the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calculated the area under the curve (AUC) values to estimate the discrimination ability. The relationship between the expression of m(6)A RNA methylation regulators and clinicopathological characteristics was explored. Kaplan-Meier plotter, log-rank test, and Cox regression were used and a nomogram was created to explore the prognostic significance of m(6)A-related genes in overall survival at the mRNA level. Pathway analysis was performed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using TCGA dataset, and a coexpression network was built based on the STRING database. We observed that YTHDF1, METTL3, and KIAA1429 were significantly upregulated, while YTHDF3, YTHDC2, METTL14, and ALKBH5 were significantly downregulated in COAD samples compared to normal samples. YTHDF1 had the highest diagnostic value. Low expression of YTHDF3 predicted a poor survival rate in COAD patients. YTHDC2 was related to sex and showed a downward trend as clinical stage increased. Our results indicate that the YT521-B homology (YTH) domain family ("readers"), especially YTHDF1, YTHDF3, and YTHDC2, might play a significant role in the detection, progression, and prognosis of COAD, indicating that they are promising cancer biomarkers.

TI MitosRNAs and extreme anoxia tolerance in embryos of the annual
   killifish Austrofundulus limnaeus
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Embryos of the annual killifish Austrofundulus limnaeus are the most anoxia-tolerant vertebrate. Annual killifish inhabit ephemeral ponds, producing drought and anoxia-tolerant embryos, which allows the species to persist generation after generation. Anoxia tolerance and physiology vary by developmental stage, creating a unique opportunity for comparative study within the species. A recent study of small ncRNA expression in A. limnaeus embryos in response to anoxia and aerobic recovery revealed small ncRNAs with expression patterns that suggest a role in supporting anoxia tolerance. MitosRNAs, small ncRNAs derived from the mitochondrial genome, emerged as an interesting group of these sequences. MitosRNAs derived from mitochondrial tRNAs were differentially expressed in developing embryos and isolated cells exhibiting extreme anoxia tolerance. In this study we focus on expression of mitosRNAs derived from tRNA-cysteine, and their subcellular and organismal localization in order to consider possible function. These tRNA-cys mitosRNAs appear enriched in the mitochondria, particularly near the nucleus, and also appear to be present in the cytoplasm. We provide evidence that mitosRNAs are generated in the mitochondria in response to anoxia, though the precise mechanism of biosynthesis remains unclear. MitosRNAs derived from tRNA-cys localize to numerous tissues, and increase in the anterior brain during anoxia. We hypothesize that these RNAs may play a role in regulating gene expression that supports extreme anoxia tolerance.

   Methods: The expression of circCCDC66 in GC tissues and cell lines was examined by qRT-PCR. The correlation between circCCDC66 expression level and clinicopathological characteristics was analyzed. The biological roles of circCCDC66 in GC cell apoptosis, proliferation, migration and invasion were determined by flow cytometry, cell counting, cell colony formation, wound healing, transwell migration and matrigel invasion assays. The role of circCCDC66 in GC growth was further confirmed by mouse xenograft tumor model. Western blot and qRT-PCR were used to explore the effects of circCCDC66 on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related gene and protein expression.
   Results: CircCCDC66 expression was elevated in both GC tissues and cell lines compared to adjacent normal tissues and normal gastric epithelial cell line. The upregulation of circCCDC66 in GC tissues was related to tumor stage and lymphatic metastasis. CircCCDC66 knockdown significantly inhibited GC cell proliferation, migration and invasion and induced cell apoptosis in GC cells. On the contrary, circCCDC66 overexpression had the opposite effects. In addition, circCCDC66 knockdown suppressed the tumorigenesis of GC cells in nude mice. Furthermore, circCCDC66 knockdown inhibited the activation of c-Myc and TGF-beta signaling pathways and reversed EMT in GC cells. c-Myc and TGF-beta interference blocked circCCDC66-mediated promotion of gastric cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion.
   Conclusion: CircCCDC66 promotes GC growth and metastasis by activating c-Myc and TGF-beta signaling pathways, suggesting that it may serve as a potential biomarker for GC.

TI Transcriptome analysis of the parasite Encephalitozoon cuniculi: an
   in-depth examination of pre-mRNA splicing in a reduced eukaryote
SO BMC GENOMICS
AB Background: The microsporidian Encephalitozoon cuniculi possesses one of the most reduced and compacted eukaryotic genomes. Reduction in this intracellular parasite has affected major cellular machinery, including the loss of over fifty core spliceosomal components compared to S. cerevisiae. To identify expression changes throughout the parasite's life cycle and also to assess splicing in the context of this reduced system, we examined the transcriptome of E. cuniculi using Illumina RNA-seq.
   Results: We observed that nearly all genes are expressed at three post-infection time-points examined. A large fraction of genes are differentially expressed between the first and second (37.7%) and first and third (43.8%) time-points, while only four genes are differentially expressed between the latter two. Levels of intron splicing are very low, with 81% of junctions spliced at levels below 50%. This is dramatically lower than splicing levels found in two other fungal species examined. We also describe the first case of alternative splicing in a microsporidian, an unexpected complexity given the reduction in spliceosomal components.
   Conclusions: Low levels of splicing observed are likely the result of an inefficient spliceosome; however, at least in one case, splicing appears to be playing a functional role. Although several RNA decay genes are encoded in E. cuniculi, the lack of a few key players could be reducing decay levels and therefore increasing the proportion of unspliced transcripts. Significant proportions of genes are differentially expressed in the first forty-eight hours but not after, indicative of genetic changes that precede the intracellular to infective stage transition.

TI Inner Mongolian Cashmere Goat Secondary Follicle Development Regulation
   Research Based on mRNA-miRNA Co-analysis
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Inner Mongolia cashmere goats, as an important part of animal husbandry production, play an important role in animal fiber industry. In recent years, scientific research has made a lot of explorations on the molecular regulation mechanism of hair follicle cycle growth, but few studies have been reported on the development of cashmere hair in fetal period. This study was based on the completion of 21 skin samples of mRNA and miRNA sequencing in 7 fetal periods (45 days, 55 days,65 days,75 days,95 days,115 days and 135 days) of the Inner Mongolia Cashmere goat. The target genes of miRNA associated with the development of secondary hair follicles in the cashmere goats were selected through the combination analysis of mRNA and miRNA data. Then the overexpression vector was constructed and the interaction between the miRNA and the target gene was identified by Dual-Luciferase Reporter Gene System. The function and interaction relationship of chi-miR-199a-5p and TGF-beta 2 were verified by RT-qPCR and western blot at the level of the fibroblasts in Inner Mongolia Cashmere goat. It provides a theoretical basis for further study of miRNA and its target genes regulating the occurrence and development of skin hair follicles. As the result shows, the expression trends of 7 genes (BAMBI, SMAD1, LTBP1, PPP2R1B, ID4, BMP8B and PITX2) and 7 miRNA (chi-miR-17-5p, chi-miR-125b-3p, chi-miR-21-5p, chi-miR-143-5p and chi-miR-106b-5p) in the skin samples for the seven stages of the fetus were shown to be consistent with the sequencing results. the results of sequencing are reliable. The correlation coefficient of TGF-beta 2 and chi-miR-199a-5p in fetal 45d-135d expression is -0.84, showing a strong negative correlation, The target relationship was preliminarily judged. The results of double luciferase vector report showed that chi-miR-199a-5p significantly decreased the expression of luciferase in TGF-beta 2 3 ' UTR, It is determined that there is a reciprocal relationship between them at a specific time. We transfected chi-miR199a-5p-FAM mimics into fibroblasts cultured in vitro from Inner Mongolia cashmere goats. After transfection, the cells were harvested to extract total RNA and protein. The mRNA and protein expression levels of TGF-beta 2 in fibroblasts were detected by RT-qPCR and western blot. It was verified that chi-miR-199a-5p inhibited TGF-beta 2 expression at both mRNA and protein translation levels in fibroblasts. At the same time, it was again proved that the TGF-beta 2 gene is a target gene of chi-miR199a-5p.

TI Prediction of Risk of Death for Patients Starting Dialysis: A Systematic
   Review and Meta-Analysis
SO CLINICAL JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF NEPHROLOGY
AB Background and objectivesDialysis is a preference-sensitive decision where prognosis may play an important role. Although patients desire risk prediction, nephrologists are wary of sharing this information. We reviewed the performance of prognostic indices for patients starting dialysis to facilitate bedside translation.Design, setting, participants, & measurementsSystematic review and meta-analysis following the PRISMA guidelines. We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Ovid Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus for eligible studies of patients starting dialysis published from inception to December 31, 2018. Selection Criteria: Articles describing validated prognostic indices predicting mortality at the start of dialysis. We excluded studies limited to prevalent dialysis patients, AKI and studies excluding mortality in the first 1-3 months. Two reviewers independently screened abstracts, performed full text assessment of inclusion criteria and extracted: study design, setting, population demographics, index performance and risk of bias. Pre-planned random effects meta-analysis was performed stratified by index and predictive window to reduce heterogeneity.ResultsOf 12,132 articles screened and 214 reviewed in full text, 36 studies were included describing 32 prognostic indices. Predictive windows ranged from 3 months to 10 years, cohort sizes from 46 to 52,796. Meta-analysis showed discrimination area under the curve (AUC) of 0.71 (95% confidence interval, 0.69 to 073) with high heterogeneity (I-2=99.12). Meta-analysis by index showed highest AUC for The Obi, Ivory, and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI)=0.74, also CCI was the most commonly used (ten studies). Other commonly used indices were Kahn-Wright index (eight studies, AUC 0.68), Hemmelgarn modification of the CCI (six studies, AUC 0.66) and REIN index (five studies, AUC 0.69). Of the indices, ten have been validated externally, 16 internally and nine were pre-existing validated indices. Limitations include heterogeneity and exclusion of large cohort studies in prevalent patients.ConclusionsSeveral well validated indices with good discrimination are available for predicting survival at dialysis start.

TI Tsetse fly (Glossina pallidipes) midgut responses to Trypanosoma brucei
   challenge
SO PARASITES & VECTORS
AB Background: Tsetse flies (Glossina spp.) are the prominent vector of African trypanosome parasites (Trypanosoma spp.) in sub-Saharan Africa, and Glossina pallidipes is the most widely distributed species in Kenya. This species displays strong resistance to infection by parasites, which are typically eliminated in the midgut shortly after acquisition from the mammalian host. Although extensive molecular information on immunity for the related species Glossina morsitans morsitans exists, similar information is scarce for G. pallidipes.
   Methods: To determine temporal transcriptional responses of G. pallidipes to Trypanosoma brucei brucei challenge, we conducted Illumina based RNA-seq on midgut organ and carcass from teneral females G. pallidipes at 24 and 48 h post-challenge (hpc) with T. b. brucei relative to their respective controls that received normal blood meals (without the parasite). We used a suite of bioinformatics tools to determine differentially expressed and enriched transcripts between and among tissues, and to identify expanded transcripts in G. pallidipes relative to their orthologs G. m. morsitans.
   Results: Midgut transcripts induced at 24 hpc encoded proteins were associated with lipid remodelling, proteolysis, collagen metabolism, apoptosis, and cell growth. Midgut transcripts induced at 48 hpc encoded proteins linked to embryonic growth and development, serine endopeptidases and proteosomal degradation of the target protein, mRNA translation and neuronal development. Temporal expression of immune responsive transcripts at 48 relative to 24 hpc was pronounced, indicative of a gradual induction of host immune responses the following challenge. We also searched for G.m. morsitans orthologous groups that may have experienced expansions in the G. pallidipes genome. We identified ten expanded groups in G. pallidipes with putative immunity-related functions, which may play a role in the higher refractoriness exhibited by this species.
   Conclusions: There appears to be a lack of strong immune responses elicited by gut epithelia of teneral adults. This in combination with a compromised peritrophic matrix at this stage during the initial phase of T.b. brucei challenge may facilitate the increased parasite infection establishment noted in teneral flies relative to older adults. Although teneral flies are more susceptible than older adults, the majority of tenerals are still able to eliminate parasite infections. Hence, robust responses elicited at a later time point, such as 72 hpc, may clear parasite infections from the majority of flies. The expanded G.m. morsitans orthologous groups in G. pallidipes may also be functionally associated with the enhanced refractoriness to trypanosome infections reported in G. pallidipes relative to G.m. morsitans.

TI Ovarian steroids, oxytocin, and tumor necrosis factor modulate equine
   oviduct function
SO DOMESTIC ANIMAL ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB The oviduct plays important roles in the early reproductive process. The aim of this study was to evaluate gene transcription and protein expression of progesterone receptor (PGR), estrogen receptors 1 (ESR1) and 2 (ESR2); oxytocin receptor (OXTR); prostaglandin F2 alpha synthase (AKR1C3), and prostaglandin E2 synthase (Ptges) in mare oviduct in different estrous cycle stages. Estradiol (E-2), progesterone (P-4), oxytocin (OXT), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) effect on in vitro PGE(2) and prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF(2 alpha)) secretion by equine oviduct explants or by oviductal epithelial cells (OEC5) were also assessed. During the breeding season, oviduct tissue was obtained post mortem from cyclic mares. Protein of ESR1, ESR2, PGR, AKR1C3, and Ptges was present in OEC5, whereas OXTR was shown in oviduct stroma. In follicular phase, protein expression of ESR1, ESR2, PGR, and OXTR increased in oviduct explants (P < 0.05), whereas no estrous cycle effect was noted for AKR1C3 or Ptges. In follicular phase, mRNA transcription was upregulated for Pgr but downregulated for Oxtr, Ptges, and Akr1c3 (P < 0.05). Nevertheless, Esr1 and Esr2 mRNA levels did not change with the estrous cycle. In the ampulla, Esr1, Esr2, and Oxtr mRNA transcription increased, but not for Pgr or Ptges. In contrast, Akr1c3 mRNA level was upregulated in the infundibulum (P < 0.05). In follicular phase, E-2, P-4, and OXT down regulated PGE(2) production by OEC (P < 0.05), but no difference was observed in mid-luteal phase. Explants production of PGE(2) rose when treated with OXT in follicular phase; with TNF or OXT in early luteal phase; or with TNF, OXT, or P-4 in mid-luteal phase. PGF(2 alpha) production by OEC was downregulated by all treatments in follicular phase but upregulated in mid-luteal phase (P < 0.05). Oviduct explants PGF(2 alpha) production was stimulated by TNF or OXT in all estrous cycle phases. In conclusion, this work has shown that ESR1, ESR2, OXTR, Ptges, and AKRLC3 gene transcription and/or translation is estrous cycle dependent and varies with oviduct portion (infundibulum vs ampulla) and cell type. Ovarian steroid hormones, OXT and TNF stimulation of PGF(2 alpha) and/or PGE(2) production is also estrous cycle dependent and varies in the different portions of mare oviduct. Differential transcription level and protein localization in various portions of the oviduct throughout the estrous cycle, as well as PG production, suggest coordinated physiologic actions and mechanisms of steroid hormones, OXT, and TNF in the equine oviduct.

TI Study on Flow in Fractured Porous Media Using Pore-Fracture Network
   Modeling
SO ENERGIES
AB Microscopic flow in fractured porous media is a typical problem for the exploitation of tight reservoirs. The rapid-flow in the fractured porous-media is of great significance to efficient and continuous oil/gas exploitation. The fractures are expected to enhance flow conductivity and mass transfer between matrix and fractures, and to improve oil displacement during water flooding. However, the fractures may also lead to water channeling under some conditions. The understanding on the mechanism of the microscopic flow in the fractured porous media has been insufficient until now. In this paper, a two-dimensional pore-fracture network model is presented to study the role of fractures in the flow. The effects of two main dimensionless parameters, fracture length to network length l(f)/l and fracture density N-f/N, on the absolute permeability and the oil displacement efficiency are investigated. The results show that the flow in the matrix plays a controlling role at a low fracture density. Once the fracture density exceeds a certain value, the flow is controlled by fractures. With the increase of the fracture density, the oil displacement efficiency develops into three typical stages: when N-f/N < 0.1, the oil displacement efficiency increases rapidly; when 0.1 < N-f/N < 0.5, the oil displacement efficiency changes slowly; and when N-f/N > 0.5, the oil displacement efficiency decreases rapidly. In the case l(f)/l > 0.8, the water mainly flows through a concentrated path connected by some fractures, resulting in it bypassing most oil regions, and thus the oil displacement efficiency decreases rapidly, similar to the water channeling.

TI Bilingualism against Diglossia in the French Royal Chancery in the Late
   Middle Ages
SO VESTNIK SANKT-PETERBURGSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-ISTORIYA
AB The article is devoted to the analysis of the use of Latin and vernacular languages in the French royal chancery during the Late Middle Ages. The language played an important role in constructing and strengthening the State. The idea of the unification of language went hand in hand with the idea of political unification. In France, the most important stage in the transition from Latin to the vernacular language was the 14th century. The first examples of the use of the vernacular language in the work of the chancery emerged on the periphery. The transition from Latin to French was not instantaneous, but took place in several phases. It should be noted that the ratio of languages was uneven in various areas of office work, and also depended on the region to which the charter was related. In this regard, many researchers propose to speak not about bilingualism, but about diglossia. Conceding with the validity of this remark, it is possible to complete this picture with several documents. In the collection of Nikolai Petrovich Likhachev (1862-1936) there is the charter of King John II (1352), the protocol and eschatocol of which are written in Latin, and the main part - in French. An analysis of this document shows how closely Latin and French coexisted in the documents of the royal chancery of France in the 14th century. It dissolves the boundaries between the niches occupied by one or the other language. Therefore, it seems not always correct to talk about diglossia.

TI Liver parenchymal cells lacking Lipocalin 2 (LCN2) are prone to
   endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein response
SO CELLULAR SIGNALLING
AB Unfolded protein response (UPR) is an adaptive mechanism allowing the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to react to an accumulation of unfolded proteins in its lumen, also known as ER stress. The UPR is interconnected with inflammation through several pathways such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) production resulting from the protein folding or alternatively, activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) via IRE1, or induction of acute phase response (APR). Lipocalin 2 (LCN2) is one of the APR proteins induced under inflammatory conditions and up-regulated during ER stress. Upon incubation of Lcn2(-/-) and wild type (wt) primary hepatocytes with tunicamycin (TM) or thapsigargin (TG) we found the Lcn2(-/-) hepatocytes to react with strong UPR to the ER stress, as evidenced by significantly increased levels of Grp94, Bip and Chop mRNA and protein compared to the wt. TM and TG-treated hepatocytes activated p65 NF-kappa B and JNK, the pathways that respond to stress stimuli and playing a central role in inflammation and apoptosis, respectively. ER stress further activated and cleaved full-length CREBH/CREB3L3, the hepatocyte specific transcription factor to induce systemic inflammatory responses. Upregulation of the C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) was very prominent in Lcn2(-/-) hepatocytes and sustained until 48 h, resulting in hepatocyte apoptosis as evidenced by increased cleaved caspase 3. We also explored the UPR of the Lcn2 null mouse livers in acute intoxication and inflammation stages with a single application of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). The Lcn2 null mice clearly developed stronger UPR in LPS- and CCl4 -induced ER stress compared to the wt. Our findings indicate that the upregulation of LCN2 during ER stress-induced inflammatory responses protects hepatocytes from being overwhelmed by UPR upon liver injury.

   Analysis
SO BIOLOGY-BASEL
AB Simple Summary
   Philasterides dicentrarchi is a free-living ciliate that causes high mortality in marine cultured fish, particularly flatfish, and in fish kept in aquaria. At present, there is still no clear picture of what makes this ciliate a fish pathogen and what makes fish resistant to this ciliate. In the present study, we used transcriptomic techniques to evaluate the interactions between P. dicentrarchi and turbot leucocytes during the early stages of infection. The findings enabled us to identify some parasite genes/proteins that may be involved in virulence and host resistance, some of which may be good candidates for inclusion in fish vaccines. Infected fish responded to infection by generating a very potent inflammatory response, indicating that the fish use all of the protective mechanisms available to prevent entry of the parasite. The findings also provide some valuable insight into how the acute inflammatory response occurs in fish.
   The present study analyses the interactions between Philasterides dicentrarchi (a ciliate parasite that causes high mortalities in cultured flatfish) and the peritoneal cells of the turbot Scophthalmus maximus during an experimental infection. The transcriptomic response was evaluated in the parasites and in the fish peritoneal cells, at 1, 2 and 4 h post-infection (hpi) in turbot injected intraperitoneally (ip) with 10(7) ciliates and at 12 and 48 hpi in turbot injected ip with 10(5) ciliates. Numerous genes were differentially expressed (DE) in P. dicentrarchi, relative to their expression in control ciliates (0 hpi): 407 (369 were up-regulated) at 1 hpi, 769 (415 were up-regulated) at 2 hpi and 507 (119 were up-regulated) at 4 hpi. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of the DE genes showed that the most representative categories of biological processes affected at 1, 2 and 4 hpi were biosynthetic processes, catabolic processes, biogenesis, proteolysis and transmembrane transport. Twelve genes of the ABC transporter family and eight genes of the leishmanolysin family were DE at 1, 2 and 4 hpi. Most of these genes were strongly up-regulated (UR), suggesting that they are involved in P. dicentrarchi infection. A third group of UR genes included several genes related to ribosome biogenesis, DNA transcription and RNA translation. However, expression of tubulins and tubulin associated proteins, such as kinesins or dyneins, which play key roles in ciliate division and movement, was down-regulated (DR). Similarly, genes that coded for lysosomal proteins or that participate in the cell cycle mitotic control, glycolysis, the Krebs cycle and/or in the electron transport chain were also DR. The transcriptomic analysis also revealed that in contrast to many parasites, which passively evade the host immune system, P. dicentrarchi strongly stimulated turbot peritoneal cells. Many genes related to inflammation were DE in peritoneal cells at 1, 2 and 4 hpi. However, the response was much lower at 12 hpi and almost disappeared completely at 48 hpi in fish that were able to kill P. dicentrarchi during the first few hpi. The genes that were DE at 1, 2 and 4 hpi were mainly related to the apoptotic process, the immune response, the Fc-epsilon receptor signalling pathway, the innate immune response, cell adhesion, cell surface receptors, the NF-kappaB signalling pathway and the MAPK cascade. Expression of toll-like receptors 2, 5 and 13 and of several components of NF-kappa B, MAPK and JAK/STAT signalling pathways was UR in the turbot peritoneal cells.
   Genes expressing chemokines and chemokine receptors, genes involved in prostaglandin and leukotriene synthesis, prostaglandins, leukotriene receptors, proinflammatory cytokines and genes involved in apoptosis were strongly UR during the first four hours of infection. However, expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as Il-10 and lipoxygenases with anti-inflammatory activity (i.e., arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase) were only UR at 12 and/or 48 hpi, indicating an anti-inflammatory state in these groups of fish. In conclusion, the present study shows the regulation of several genes in P. dicentrarchi during the early stages of infection, some of which probably play important roles in this process. The infection induced a potent acute inflammatory response, and many inflammatory genes were regulated in peritoneal cells, showing that the turbot uses all the protective mechanisms it has available to prevent the entry of the parasite.

TI Determination of core pathways for oral squamous cell carcinoma via the
   method of attract
SO JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND THERAPEUTICS
AB Objective: We expected to demonstrate a practical framework for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) candidate biomarker analysis at the pathway level based on the attract method, so as to give great insights to reveal the pathological mechanism underlying this disease at its early stage. Methods: First, gene expression profile of OSCC was recruited and preprocessed. Then, Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis was conducted. Next, attract method, an approach that begins its analysis from the "foundation knowledge sets" to discriminate the cell-phenotypes by those well-annotated gene-sets, then expands the syn-expression groups via decomposing each significant pathway into correlated subsets and extends the analysis to the entire expression was applied to identify core pathways. Finally, gene ontology (GO) functional enrichment analysis was performed on each of the correlated set groups to discover any potentially shared biological themes. Results: A total of 226 pathways were obtained. Then, 39 core KEGG pathways was identified via attract. After removing the uninformative genes, a total of 1, 2, and 3 clusters were separately identified for the three discriminative pathways extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, and cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) pathway based on the correlation coefficient < 0.85. GO functional enrichment analysis for the correlated partners groups indicated that there were 40, 11, 78 significant GO terms for ECM-receptor interaction, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, and CAMs pathway, respectively. Conclusions: We predict that pathways such as ECM-receptor interaction, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, and CAMs may play significant roles in OSCC and targeting these pathways may provide an effective avenue to combat the complicated illness.

TI Decreased expression of iron regulatory protein-1 in hepatocellular
   carcinoma associates with poor prognosis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL PATHOLOGY
AB Background: Iron regulatory protein-1 (IRP1) plays a critical role in cellular iron homeostasis and in the TCA cycle, which are closely associated with cancer development. However, the diagnostic and prognostic value of IRP1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was not still estimated. Therefore, it was necessary to verify its expression and significance in patients with HCC in this study. Methods: The expression of IRP1 was analyzed in 42 paired HCC samples (HCC tissues vs matched adjacent non-cancerous liver tissues) and 191 paraffin-embedded HCC sections using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Then, receivers operating characteristic curve (ROC), Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis were applied to evaluate the potential diagnostic and prognostic value of IRP1, respectively. Results: IRP1 expression level was significantly decreased in HCC tissues compared to the corresponding adjacent nontumorous liver tissues (P = 0.0003). Further correlation analyses indicated that the expression of IRP1 was significantly associated with TNM stage (P = 0.008) and vascular invasion (P = 0.008). ROC analysis showed the AUC was 0.765, and the optimal cutoff value of integrated optical density was 40860000, providing a sensitivity of 64.29% and a specificity of 76.19%. Moreover, overall survival (OS) and time to recurrence (TTR) analyses showed HCC patients with low IRP1 expression had lower survival rate (P = 0.007) and higher recurrence rate (P = 0.033). Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed that IRP1 was an independent prognostic factor for TTR (HR = 0.616, 95% CI = 0.398-0.952, P = 0.029). Conclusion: Collectively, our study demonstrated that IRP1 could be served as a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker for HCC patients.

TI Thyroid hormone, gene expression, and Central Nervous System: Where we
   are
SO SEMINARS IN CELL & DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB Thyroid hormones (TH; T3 and T4) play a fundamental role in the fetal stage to the adult phase, controlling gene and protein expression in virtually all tissues. The endocrine and CNS systems have relevant interaction, and the TH are pivotal for the proper functioning of the CNS. A slight failure to regulate TH availability during pregnancy and/or childhood can lead to neurological disorders, for example, autism and cognitive impairment, or depression. In this review, we highlight how TH acts in controlling gene expression, its role in the CNS, and what substances widely found in the environment can cause in this tissue. We highlight the role of Endocrine Disruptors used on an everyday basis in the processing of mRNAs responsible for neurodevelopment. We conclude that TH, more precisely T3, acts mainly throughout its nuclear receptors, that the deficiency of this hormone, either due to the lack of its main substrate iodine, or by to incorrect organification of T4 and T3 in the gland, or by a mutation in transporters, receptors and deiodinases may cause mild (dysregulated mood in adulthood) to severe neurological impairment (Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, presented as early as childhood); T3 is responsible for the expression of numerous CNS genes related to oxygen transport, growth factors, myelination, cell maturation. Substances present in the environment and widely used can interfere with the functioning of the thyroid gland, the action of TH, and the functioning of the CNS.

TI Electrochemical Fluorination and Radiofluorination of Methyl(phenylthio)
   acetate Using Tetrabutylammonium Fluoride (TBAF)
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Electrochemical fluorination of methyl(phenylthio) acetate was achieved using tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF). Electrochemical fluorination was performed under potentiostatic anodic oxidation using an undivided cell in acetonitrile containing TBAF and triflic acid. The influence of several parameters including: oxidation potential, time, temperature, sonication, TBAF concentration and triflic acid concentration on fluorination efficiency were studied. It was found that the triflic acid to TBAF concentration ratio plays a key role in the fluorination efficiency. Electrochemical fluorination resulted in formation of mono-fluorinated methyl 2fluoro- 2-(phenylthio) acetate verified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy. Under optimum conditions 44 +/- 3% mono fluorination yield was obtained after a 30 min electrolysis. Electrochemical radiofluorination for the synthesis of methyl 2-[F-18] fluoro-2-(phenothio) acetate was also achieved with the same optimized electrochemical cell parameters where TBAF was first passed through an anion exchange resin containing fluorine-18. A radiochemical fluorination efficiency of 7 +/- 1% was achieved after 30 min of electrolysis. (C) The Author(s) 2017. Published by ECS. All rights reserved.

TI Trichuris trichiura egg extract proteome reveals potential diagnostic
   targets and immunomodulators
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB Embryonated eggs are the infectious developmental stage of Trichuris trichiura and are the primary stimulus for the immune system of the definitive host. The intestinal-dwelling T. trichiura affects an estimated 465 million people worldwide with an estimated global burden of disease of 640 000 DALYs (Disability Adjusted Life Years). In Latin America and the Caribbean, trichuriasis is the most prevalent soil transmitted helminthiasis in the region (12.3%; 95% CI). The adverse health consequences impair childhood school performance and reduce school attendance resulting in lower future wage-earning capacity. The accumulation of the long-term effects translates into poverty promoting sequelae and a cycle of impoverishment. Each infective T. trichiura egg carries the antigens needed to face the immune system with a wide variety of proteins present in the shell, larvae's surface, and the accompanying fluid that contains their excretions/secretions. We used a proteomic approach with tandem mass spectrometry to investigate the proteome of soluble non-embryonated egg extracts of T. trichiura obtained from naturally infected African green monkeys (Chlorocebus sabaeus). A total of 231 proteins were identified, 168 of them with known molecular functions. The proteome revealed common proteins families which are known to play roles in energy and metabolism; the cytoskeleton, muscle and motility; proteolysis; signaling; the stress response and detoxification; transcription and translation; and lipid binding and transport. In addition to the study of the T. trichiura non-embryonated egg proteome, the antigenic profile of the T. trichiura non-embryonated egg and female soluble proteins against serum antibodies from C. sabaeus naturally infected with trichuriasis was investigated. We used an immunoproteomic approach by Western blot and tandem mass spectrometry from the corresponding SDS-PAGE gels. Vitellogenin N and VWD and DUF1943 domain containing protein, poly-cysteine and histidine tailed protein isoform 2, heat shock protein 70, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, actin, and enolase, were among the potential immunoactive proteins. To our knowledge, this is the first study on the T. trichiura non-embryonated egg proteome as a novel source of information on potential targets for immunodiagnostics and immunomodulators from a neglected tropical disease. This initial list of T. trichiura non-embryonated egg proteins (proteome and antigenic profile) can be used in future research on the immunobiology and pathogenesis of human trichuriasis and the treatment of human intestinal immune-related diseases.
   Author summary
   Who came first the worm or its egg? In the case of whipworm, we know it is the egg. The infective life cycle stage of the human whipworm (Trichuris trichiura) is the primary stimulus for the immune system of the definitive host. Each infective whipworm egg carries the information needed to face the immune system of the host with a wide variety of proteins present in the shell, larvae's surface, and the accompanying fluid that contains their excretions/secretions. We investigated the soluble proteins of the non-embryonated egg using an immunoproteomic approach and then selected the top five proteins using a series of bioinformatic analysis. We used these top five proteins to recognize potential targets for immunodiagnostics and immunomodulation while comparing them to known female worm proteins. We found that the proteins we selected were involved in lipid transport, energy and metabolism, and muscle and motility. One protein has unknown function.

TI Going Beyond STS Education: Building a Curriculum for Sociopolitical
   Activism
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE MATHEMATICS AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION
AB The focus of this paper is on the Science-Technology-Society (STS) initiative, developed in the 1980s, subsequently expanded to STSE to acknowledge environmental concerns and later expanded further to include the provision of opportunities for students to confront socioscientific issues (SSI), often of a controversial and certainly of a topical nature.
   The article focuses on the key issues that need to be addressed in building such a curriculum, including selection of appropriate SSI, ensuring access to the necessary scientific knowledge, developing the necessary media literacy to access other material relevant to the issues, fostering the political awareness needed for critical interpretation of issues and building the ethical understanding needed to address the complex issues raised by controversial SSI. Teachers introducing SSI into the curriculum need to be sensitive to the profound emotions that can be generated among students encountering controversial issues for the first time. An understanding of emotional intelligence, emotional literacy and emotional competence is essential, and building students' capacities in these matters is crucial to helping them deal with potentially stressful and disconcerting learning situations that will inevitably arise.
   I argue that a curriculum to build students' capacity for sociopolitical action on SSI can be developed through a 4-stage model: (1) appreciating the societal and environmental impact of scientific and technological change, and recognizing that science and technology are, to some extent, culturally determined; (2) recognizing that decisions about scientific and technological development are taken in pursuit of particular interests, that benefits accruing to some may be at the expense of others and that developments in science and technology are inextricably linked with the distribution of wealth and power; (3) addressing controversy, clarifying values, resolving ethical dilemmas, formulating and developing one's own views and justifying them through discussion and argument; and (4) preparing for and taking action on socioscientific and environmental issues. Stage 4 is further divided into learning about action, learning through action and learning from action. Learning about action focuses on learning the skills and strategies of sociopolitical action through movies, biographies and autobiographies, case studies and simulations, role-play and dramatic reconstructions. Learning through action comprises direct involvement in action-oriented projects outside the classroom that are likely to have tangible outcomes and consequences.
   The prime purpose of this action-oriented approach to addressing complex and controversial SSI is to enable young citizens to look critically at the society we have and the values that sustain it, and to ask what can and should be changed in order to achieve a more socially just democracy and bring about more environmentally sustainable lifestyles. It almost goes without saying that teachers who introduce SSI into the curriculum need to be sensitive to the need to assist students in dealing with potentially stressful and disconcerting learning situations. It is here that notions of emotional intelligence, emotional literacy and emotional competence can be helpful. Furthermore, there are many reasons why the translation of this kind of curriculum rhetoric into practical action in real classrooms will be extraordinarily complex and difficult. Such a radical change in the nature of the school curriculum puts a whole raft of new demands on teachers; it challenges many of the assumptions on which schooling is traditionally based; it is predicated on a commitment to bringing about extensive and wide-ranging social change at local, regional, national and international levels.

TI SNHG16 is regulated by the Wnt pathway in colorectal cancer and affects
   genes involved in lipid metabolism
SO MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY
AB It is well established that lncRNAs are aberrantly expressed in cancer where they have been shown to act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. RNA profiling of 314 colorectal adenomas/adenocarcinomas and 292 adjacent normal colon mucosa samples using RNA sequencing demonstrated that the snoRNA host gene 16 (SNHG16) is significantly up regulated in adenomas and all stages of CRC. SNHG16 expression was positively correlated to the expression of Wnt-regulated transcription factors, including ASCL2, ETS2, and cMyc. In vitro abrogation of Wnt signaling in CRC cells reduced the expression of SNHG16 indicating that SNHG16 is regulated by the Wnt pathway. Silencing of SNHG16 resulted in reduced viability, increased apoptotic cell death and impaired cell migration. The SNHG16 silencing particularly affected expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism. A connection between SNHG16 and genes involved in lipid metabolism was also observed in clinical tumors. Argonaute CrossLinking and ImmunoPrecipitation (AGO-CLIP) demonstrated that SNHG16 heavily binds AGO and has 27 AGO/miRNA target sites along its length, indicating that SNHG16 may act as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) "sponging" miRNAs off their cognate targets. Most interestingly, half of the miRNA families with high confidence targets on SNHG16 also target the 3'UTR of Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase (SCD). SCD is involved in lipid metabolism and is down-regulated upon SNHG16 silencing. In conclusion, up-regulation of SNHG16 is a frequent event in CRC, likely caused by deregulated Wnt signaling. In vitro analyses demonstrate that SNHG16 may play an oncogenic role in CRC and that it affects genes involved in lipid metabolism, possible through ceRNA related mechanisms.

TI Deleted in Azoospermia-Like Enhances In Vitro Derived Porcine Germ Cell
   Formation and Meiosis
SO STEM CELLS AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Evidence supporting that deleted in azoospermia-like (DAZL) plays a key role during gametogenesis and meiosis continues to emerge. Our study aimed to determine whether overexpression of DAZL using a lentiviral approach in a somatic stem cell to germ cell in vitro differentiation culture could enhance the formation of primordial germ cell-like cells (PLCs) and oocyte-like cells (OLCs). Introduction of DAZL at the beginning of induced differentiation significantly increased the formation of Fragilis-positive PLCs, which was independent of mitotic proliferation. In addition, mRNA levels of the germ cell markers Oct4, Stella, and Vasa were also higher in the DAZL-transduced group and suppressed when DAZL was knocked down using small interference RNA. At later stages of differentiation, the expression of several genes associated with meiosis, including Scp3, Dmc1, Rec8, and Stra8, was determined to be significantly higher when DAZL was overexpressed, which was abrogated by its knockdown. Exogenous introduction of DAZL also increased the protein levels of SCP3 and VASA, which again was reversed by its knockdown. Although not a common phenomenon in the in vitro differentiation system, the percentage of SCP3-positive cells displaying meiotic chromosome patterns in the DAZL-transduced group was higher than in the control, as was the overall percentage of OLCs that were generated. The introduction of factors such as DAZL into a stem cell-to-germ cell differentiation culture may provide an opportunity to better understand the key genes and their interactions during gametogenesis, also providing a means to enhance the generation of germ cells in vitro.

Chromosome 1 open reading frame 35 (C1orf35) is a gene cloned and identified in our laboratory from a MM cell line (GenBank: AY137773), but little is known about its function. In the current study, we have confirmed that C1orf35 is a candidate oncogene, and it can promote cell cycle progression from G1 to S. Later, we found that C1orf35 is able to affect the cell proliferation by modulating the expression of c-MYC (v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog), and the oncogenic property of C1orf35 can be rescued by c-MYC inhibition. Herein, we found positive association between C1orf35 and c-MYC in MM patients and in MM cell lines. The correlation analysis of the genes coamplified in MM patients from GEO datasets showed a correlation between C1orf35 and c-MYC, and the expression data of different stages of plasma cell neoplasm acquired from GEO datasets showed that the expression of C1orf35 increase with the progression of the disease. This indicates that C1orf35 may play a role in the disease progression. Moreover, C1orf35 can modulate c-MYC expression and rescue c-MYC transcription inhibited by Act D. Finally, we have shown that C1orf35 activates c-MYC transcription by binding to the i-motif of Nuclease hypersensitivity element III1 (NHE III1) in the c-MYC promoter. Not only does our current study advance our knowledge of the pathogenesis and therapeutic landscape of MM, but also of other cancer types and diseases that are initiated with deregulated c-MYC transcription.

TI Review on circular RNAs and new insights into their roles in cancer
SO COMPUTATIONAL AND STRUCTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL
AB Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a very interesting class of conserved single-stranded RNA molecules derived from exonic or intronic sequences by precursor mRNA back-splicing. Unlike canonical linear RNAs, circRNAs form covalently closed, continuous stable loops without a 50end cap and 30end poly(A) tail, and therefore are resistant to exonuclease digestion. The majority of circRNAs are highly abundant, and conserved across different species with a tissue or developmental-stage-specific expression. circRNAs have been shown to play important roles as microRNA sponges, regulators of gene splicing and transcription, RNA-binding protein sponges and protein/peptide translators. Emerging evidence reveals that circRNAs function in various human diseases, particularly cancers, and may function as better predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. In consideration of their potential clinical relevance, circRNAs have become a new research hotspot in the field of tumor pathology. In the present study, the current understanding of the biogenesis, characteristics, databases, research methods, biological functions subcellular distribution, epigenetic regulation, extracellular transport and degradation of circRNAs was discussed. In particular, the multiple databases and methods involved in circRNA research were first summarized, and the recent advances in determining the potential roles of circRNAs in tumor growth, migration and invasion, which render circRNAs better predictive biomarkers, were described. Furthermore, future perspectives for the clinical application of circRNAs in the management of patients with cancer were proposed, which could provide new insights into circRNAs in the future.

TI What non-natural factors are behind the underuse of EU CAP funds in
   areas with valuable habitats?
SO LAND USE POLICY
AB While the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (EU CAP) is being redefined, natural habitats, treated as wasteland for many years, are becoming a crucial element in the promotion of environmentally-friendly management of farmland and the protection of biodiversity and the local cultural landscape. The aim of the study is to assess the effectiveness of the uptake of certain environmental CAP funds and to describe the factors behind the spatial differentiation of the uptake of these funds. Both natural and non-natural conditions are taken into account. The analysis is conducted for Poland, a country engaged in reform of the agricultural economy, which has sizeable areas of habitats of high value for nature and which represents a region of Europe in need of special public support for environmental improvement. The research procedure consisted of the following four main stages: (1) spatial delimitation of grasslands (taking into account their territorial rank and quality) and (2) the level of utilisation of funds under specific Agri-Environmental and Climate Schemes (AECSs), (3) determining the relationships - types and (4) identifying the causes of disproportions, taking into account selected nonnatural conditions. Apart from indicator methods, use is made of spatial typology and spatial autocorrelation methods (global and local Moran I coefficients). The results of the analysis show the decisive influence of natural and environmental conditions on the amount of funds expended through AECSs. However, the study has also identified situations where non-natural factors come to the fore. Among the non-natural conditions, a key role is played by historical factors. The study has identified areas with untapped environmental potential and those where environmental farming measures are underutilised given the environmental potential of those areas. The situation described is detrimental to the effectiveness of support, which is contrary to CAP principles. The findings are important in the context of monitoring and evaluating the EU's agricultural policies, which should take more account of the characteristics of the individual countries, including their natural regional and local specificities.

TI Akt1/mTORC1 signaling modulates adaptive immune response of Nile tilapia
   by promoting lymphocyte activation and proliferation
SO DEVELOPMENTAL AND COMPARATIVE IMMUNOLOGY
AB Serving as a significant signaling molecule, RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (Akt1) plays indispensable roles in cell cycle, growth, survival, metabolism, as well as immune response. However, how Akt1 regulates adaptive immune response in early vertebrate, especially the teleost, is largely unknown. Here, using a Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus model, we investigated the regulatory role of Akt1 in adaptive immunity of teleost. Both sequence and structure of the O. niloticus Akt1 (OnAkt1), were evolutionarily conserved comparing with the counterparts from other vertebrates. mRNA of OnAkt1 was widely expressed in lymphoid organs/tissues of Nile tilapia, with relative higher level in PBL. After Nile tilapia was infected by Aeromonas hydrophila, both transcription and phosphorylation levels of OnAkt1 were obviously elevated in spleen lymphocytes at the adaptive immune stage, suggesting Akt1 participated in primary adaptive immune response of Nile tilapia. Furthermore, OnAkt1 transcript or phosphorylation was dramatically augmented after spleen lymphocytes were activated by T cell specific mitogen PHA or lymphocyte agonist PMA. More critically, inhibition of Akt1 by specific inhibitor crippled the activation of downstream mTORC1 signaling, and impaired the up-regulation of T cell activation markers CD44, IFN-gamma and CD122 in spleen lymphocytes upon PHA-induced T cell activation. Meanwhile, blockade of Akt1-activated mTORC1 signaling also decreased the frequency of BrdU(+) lymphocytes during A. hydrophila infection, indicating the critical role of Akt1 in regulating lymphocyte proliferation of Nile tilapia. Together, our results demonstrated that Akt1 modulated adaptive immune response of Nile tilapia by promoting lymphocyte activation and proliferation via mTORC1 signaling. Our study enriched the regulatory mechanism of lymphocyte-mediated adaptive immunity in teleost, and thus provided novel insights into the evolution of adaptive immune system.

TI Lactate metabolism-related genes to predict the clinical outcome and
   molecular characteristics of endometrial cancer
SO BMC CANCER
AB BackgroundMetabolic reprogramming is one of hallmarks of cancer progression and is of great importance for the tumor microenvironment (TME). As an abundant metabolite, lactate has been found to play a critical role in cancer development and immunosuppression of TME. However, the potential role of lactate metabolism-related genes in endometrial cancer (EC) remains obscure.MethodsRNA sequencing data and clinical information of EC were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Lactate metabolism-related genes (LMRGs) WERE from Molecular Signature Database v7.4 and then compared the candidate genes from TCGA to obtain final genes. Univariate analysis and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) Cox regression were performed to screen prognostic genes. A lactate metabolism-related risk profile was constructed using multivariate Cox regression analysis. The signature was validated by time-dependent ROC curve analysis and Kaplan-Meier analysis. The relationship between the risk score and age, grade, stage, tumor microenvironmental characteristics, and drug sensitivity was as well explored by correlation analyses. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway functional analysis between the high and low-risk groups were performed. CCK8, EdU, and clone formation assays were applied to detect the proliferation ability of EC cells, Transwell assay was performed to detect the migration ability of EC cells, and intracellular lactate and glucose content was used to asses lactate metabolism.ResultsWe constructed a risk signature based on 18 LMRGs. Kaplan-Meier curves confirmed that the high-risk group had poorer prognosis compared to the low-risk group. A nomogram was then constructed to predict the probability of EC survival. We also performed GO enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway functional analysis between the high and low-risk groups, and the outcome revealed that the features were significantly associated with energy metabolism. There was a significant correspondence between LMRGs and tumor mutational load, checkpoints and immune cell infiltration. C1, C2, and C4 were the most infiltrated in the high-risk group. The high-risk group showed increased dendritic cell activation, while the low-risk group showed increased plasma cells and Treg cells. Drug sensitivity analysis showed LMRGs risk was more resistant to Scr kinase inhibitors. We further proved that one of the lactate metabolism related genes, TIMM50 could promote EC cell proliferation, migration and lactate metabolism.ConclusionIn conclusion, we have established an effective prognostic signature based on LMRG expression patterns, which may greatly facilitate the assessment of prognosis, molecular features and treatment modalities in EC patients and may be useful in the future translation to clinical applications. TIMM50 was identified as a novel molecule that mediates lactate metabolism in vitro and in vivo, maybe a promising target for EC prognosis.

TI Hatching plasticity in the tropical gastropod Nerita scabricosta
SO INVERTEBRATE BIOLOGY
AB Hatching plasticity has been documented in diverse terrestrial and freshwater taxa, but in few marine invertebrates. Anecdotal observations over the last 80years have suggested that intertidal neritid snails may produce encapsulated embryos able to significantly delay hatching. The cause for delays and the cues that trigger hatching are unknown, but temperature, salinity, and wave action have been suggested to play a role. We followed individual egg capsules of Nerita scabricosta in 16 tide pools to document the variation in natural time to hatching and to determine if large delays in hatching occur in the field. Hatching occurred after about 30d and varied significantly among tide pools in the field. Average time to hatching in each pool was not correlated with presence of potential predators, temperature, salinity, or pool size. We also compared hatching time between egg capsules in the field to those kept in the laboratory at a constant temperature in motionless water, and to those kept in the laboratory with sudden daily water motion and temperature changes. There was no significant difference in the hatching rate between the two laboratory treatments, but capsules took, on average, twice as long to hatch in the laboratory as in the field. Observations of developing embryos showed that embryos in the field develop slowly and continuously until hatching, but embryos in the laboratory reach the hatching stage during the first month of development and remain in stasis after that. Instances of hatching plasticity in benthic marine invertebrates, like the one in N. scabricosta, could greatly enhance our ability to investigate the costs and benefits of benthic versus planktonic development, a long-standing area of interest for invertebrate larval biologists.

TI King Kong adaptations (1959-2017): Traversing culture and society
SO TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE
AB The adaptation of the King Kong musical in 2017 could not have been done without the memory of the original musical since the original had considerable cultural resonance when it was performed in 1959.
   King Kong is one of the most significant productions in the history of South African theatre. When the production was first staged in 1959, it involved 72 musicians and dancers and it aimed to showcase the vibrancy of an emerging urban black culture to primarily white audiences. Other factors have also contributed to King Kong being an important production in the history of South African theatre. For example, it was also one of the first productions which transgressed apartheid era strictures by showing collaboration between Africans and whites. Its principal actors went on to achieve international acclaim and the musical was hugely successful when it was performed in London. These factors all contributed to the way in which the musical was adapted in 2017.
   In discussing the adaptation, I consider that the musical has undergone various permutations, namely an original story outline and piano-based composition written by Pat Williams and Todd Matshikiza respectively (version number one) as well as the expansion of this script by Harry Bloom and the orchestration of the music (version number two). Furthermore, a third version of the musical was written for performance in England, which became known in published form as King Kong. The African jazz opera.
   It is important to note that King Kong had only been performed as a, full production in South Africa in 1959 and in 2017, yet in the intervening years, the musical was part of the public consciousness. In this article, I argue that the memories of the original production, including the prevailing sociopolitical conditions of 1959, cannot be divorced from the later version of the musical. Miriam Makeba, Hugh Masekela and Pat Williams all have written autobiographies in which they relate their involvement in the original King Kong production. Firstly, I will discuss how the original participants in the musical have contributed to building a considerable legacy for the musical. Both versions of the musical are then compared to outline how the past reverberates in the new adaptation, particularly in the role ofthe leading female character, Joyce. I wish to demonstrate that memories ofthe 1959 version were prevalent in the 2017 production. Marvin Carlson sees the implied as well as intertextual links between past and current theatrical texts as analogous to the presence of ghosts of the previous production. Furthermore, the adaptation is explored by analysing the production as a written text as well as the performance of the text and explores the way translation (of culture and specifically words) played an important role in the original production itself.
   The structure of the production is an important factor when discussing the 2017 adaptation. Notably, the "original" King Kong (1959) was written as a retroversion, in which three township "washer women" and a male resident recount the story of the great boxer, King Kong, who ignited the township with his boxing prowess. The boxer fell in love with Joyce, who owned a shebeen called "Back of the Moon" but was also the girlfriend of Lucky, a feared gangster.
   Through Lucky's. machinations, King Kong loses a crucial match, which is the beginning of his descent into lawlessness. King Kong is arrested and sent to prison. When he returns from jail he sees that Joyce has reunited with Lucky and he kills her. During his trial for Jovices murder King Kong begs the judge to sentence him to death - a plea which is denied. Ultimately while working as part of a prisoner work gang, King Kong dies, apparently due to suicide. The first two versions of the production present the character as a victim of the apartheid justice system. The reworking of the musical for its London staging kept the retrospective nature of the dramatic narrative but added some sequences of African dance leading to much praise by critics in London when the musical was performed in 1961.
   This article also discusses the complexity of translating a text from one cultural context to another. The local producers of the musical (in 1961) wanted to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the Johannesburg version. However, the English producer demanded that a structure be imposed on the musical, so that it would fit in with contemporary theatrical conventions of the London West End At the same time, the representation of African culture (music, song and dance) was also deliberately exoticised - to differentiate the musical from current productions on the circuit at that time. Ironically, this is the version that has been captured as a published script.
   The producers of the 2017 adaptation were critical of the London version of King Kong. The criticism they directed at the London version was that it was more qfa "Broadwaydisation" of the South African version. Therefore, in the 2017 adaptation, extraneous scenes ofgumboot dancing were removed Additionally, the dramatic narrative was restructured as an unfolding dramatic narrative. This necessitated the writing of new scenes to illustrate why the character King Kong was revered in the township, as well as to actualise some key dramatic moments. Furthermore, the 2017 adaptation observed current social norms and sensitivities. One change involved changing the name of King Kong's opponent. In the original versions, the opponent was named "Apeman Khanyile", a name that was changed to Joe Khanvile as it would be inappropriate within contemporary discourse to stage a boxing match in which duelling African men were compared to apes. Another change involved the killing of Joyce. In the original, her death was merely presented as evidence of King Kong k downfall, thereby reducing the incident of her murder to secondary status. In the 2017 adaptation, the writers were cognisant of contemporary South African discourse on gender-based violence. Therefore, the new version asserts Joyces victimisation at the hands of a man she knows. This shows that adaptations of theatre work of necessity take new social norms into account. Thus, adaptations involve more than updating a play's structure and dialogue - they also account for how one locates an old play within contemporary discourse, without losing the play's historical time setting and integrity.
   Despite being absent from South African stages for several decades, King Kong has significantly influenced the development of South African theatre, particularly within the genre of the South African musical. This legacy encompasses a variety of playwrights. The most literal manifestation of the cultural impact of King Kong is apparent in King Africa - The Musical (1988) in which the principal themes, style of presentation and music echoed those of King Kong. The cultural deposit of the musical ranges far and wide and sees the use of music as a contextual signifier for (African) society, culture and politics. Notably, Sieborger (2016) analyses Kramer and Petersen's District Six - The Musical, as an aspect of "public history". There are many other significant musicals which have devolved from this heritage, among them Brickhill-Burke's Meropa (1974), Kramer and Petersen's Poison (1994) and Richard Loring's African Footprint (2000). These illustrate the longevity of the (at times politicised) South African musical as a genre and further suggests that this theatrical category is embedded in South African theatre practice.

TI Diversification and enrichment of clinical biomaterials inspired by
   Darwinian evolution
SO ACTA BIOMATERIALIA
AB Regenerative medicine and biomaterials design are driven by biomimicry. There is the essential requirement to emulate human cell, tissue, organ and physiological complexity to ensure long-lasting clinical success. Biomimicry projects for biomaterials innovation can be re-invigorated with evolutionary insights and perspectives, since Darwinian evolution is the original dynamic process for biological organisation and complexity. Many existing human inspired regenerative biomaterials (defined as a nature generated, nature derived and nature mimicking structure, produced within a biological system, which can deputise for, or replace human tissues for which it closely matches) are without important elements of biological complexity such as, hierarchy and autonomous actions. It is possible to engineer these essential elements into clinical biomaterials via bioinspired implementation of concepts, processes and mechanisms played out during Darwinian evolution: mechanisms such as, directed, computational, accelerated evolutions and artificial selection contrived in the laboratory. These dynamos for innovation can be used during biomaterials fabrication, but also to choose optimal designs in the regeneration process. Further evolutionary information can help at the design stage: gleaned from the historical evolution of material adaptations compared across phylogenies to changes in their environment and habitats. Taken together, harnessing evolutionary mechanisms and evolutionary pathways, leading to ideal adaptations, will eventually provide a new class of Darwinian and evolutionary biomaterials. This will provide bioengineers with a more diversified and more efficient innovation tool for biomaterial design, synthesis and function than currently achieved with synthetic materials chemistry programmes and rational based materials design approach, which require reasoned logic. It will also inject further creativity, diversity and richness into the biomedical technologies that we make. All of which are based on biological principles. Such evolution-inspired biomaterials have the potential to generate innovative solutions, which match with existing bioengineering problems, in vital areas of clinical materials translation that include tissue engineering, gene delivery, drug delivery, immunity modulation, and scar-less wound healing.
   Statement of Significance
   Evolution by natural selection is a powerful generator of innovations in molecular, materials and structures. Man has influenced evolution for thousands of years, to create new breeds of farm animals and crop plants, but now molecular and materials can be molded in the same way. Biological molecules and simple structures can be evolved, literally in the laboratory. Furthermore, they are re-designed via lessons learnt from evolutionary history. Through a 3-step process to (1) create variants in material building blocks, (2) screen the variants with beneficial traits/properties and (3) select and support their self-assembly into usable materials, improvements in design and performance can emerge. By introducing biological molecules and small organisms into this process, it is possible to make increasingly diversified, sophisticated and clinically relevant materials for multiple roles in biomedicine.

TI Developing a tailored RBS linking to BIM for risk management of bridge
   projects
SO ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to address the current theoretical gap in integrating knowledge and experience into Building Information Model (BIM) for risk management of bridge projects by developing a tailored Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS) and formalising an active link between the resulting RBS and BIM.
   Design/methodology/approach - A three-step approach is used in this study to develop a tailored RBS for bridge projects and a conceptual model for the linkage between the RBS and BIM. First, the integrated bridge information model is in concept separated into four levels of contents (LOCs) and six technical systems based on analysis of the Industry Foundation Classes specification, a critical review of previous studies and authors' project experience. The second step develops a knowledge-based risk database through an extensive collection of risk data, a process of data mining, and further assessment and translation of data. A critical analysis is conducted in the last step to determine on which level the different risks should be allocated to bridge projects and to propose a conceptual model for linking the tailored RBS to the four LOCs and six technical systems of BIM.
   Findings - The findings suggest that the traditional method and BIM can be merged as an integrated solution for risk management by establishing the linkage between RBS and BIM. This solution can take advantage of both the traditional method and BIM for managing risks. On the one hand, RBS enables risk information to be stored in a formal structure, used and communicated effectively. On the other hand, some features of BIM such as 3D visualisation and 4D construction scheduling can facilitate the risk identification, analysis, and communication at an early project stage.
   Research limitations/implications - A limitation is that RBS is a qualitative technique and only plays a limited role in quantitative risk analysis. As a result, when implementing this proposed method, further techniques may be needed for assisting quantitative risk analysis, evaluation, and treatment. Another limitation is that the proposed method has not yet been implemented for validation in practice. Hence, recommendations for future research are to: improve the quantitative risk analysis and treatment capabilities of this proposed solution; develop computer tools to support the solution; integrate the linkage into a traditional workflow; and test this solution in some small and large projects for validation.
   Practical implications - Through linking risk information to BIM, project participants could check and review the linked information for identifying potential risks and seeking possible mitigation measures, when project information is being transferred between different people or forwarded to the next phase.
   Originality/value - This study contributes to the theoretical development for aligning traditional methods and BIM for risk management, by introducing a new conceptual model for linking RBS to BIM.

TI Human vitreous in proliferative diabetic retinopathy: Characterization
   and translational implications
SO PROGRESS IN RETINAL AND EYE RESEARCH
AB Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of visual impairment in the working-age population. DR is a progressive eye disease caused by long-term accumulation of hyperglycaemia-mediated pathological alterations in the retina of diabetic patients. DR begins with asymptomatic retinal abnormalities and may progress to advanced-stage proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), characterized by neovascularization or preretinal/vitreous haemorrhages. The vitreous, a transparent gel that fills the posterior cavity of the eye, plays a vital role in maintaining ocular function. Structural and molecular alterations of the vitreous, observed during DR progression, are consequences of metabolic and functional modifications of the retinal tissue. Thus, vitreal alterations reflect the pathological events occurring at the vitreoretinal interface. These events are caused by hypoxic, oxidative, inflammatory, neurodegenerative, and leukostatic conditions that occur during diabetes. Conversely, PDR vitreous can exert pathological effects on the diabetic retina, resulting in activation of a vicious cycle that contributes to disease progression. In this review, we recapitulate the major pathological features of DR/PDR, and focus on the structural and molecular changes that characterize the vitreal structure and composition during DR and progression to PDR. In PDR, vitreous represents a reservoir of pathological signalling molecules. Therefore, in this review we discuss how studying the biological activity of the vitreous in different in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo experimental models can provide insights into the pathogenesis of PDR. In addition, the vitreous from PDR patients can represent a novel tool to obtain preclinical experimental evidences for the development and characterization of new therapeutic drug candidates for PDR therapy.

TI FMRP ligand circZNF609 destabilizes RAC1 mRNA to reduce metastasis in
   acral melanoma and cutaneous melanoma
SO JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH
AB Background Melanoma is a type of malignant tumor with high aggressiveness and poor prognosis. At present, metastasis of melanoma is still an important cause of death in melanoma patients. However, the potential functions and molecular mechanisms of most circular RNAs (circRNAs) in melanoma metastasis remain unknown. Methods circRNAs dysregulated in melanoma cell subgroups with different metastatic abilities according to a screening model based on repeated Transwell assays were identified with a circRNA array. The expression and prognostic significance of circZNF609 in skin cutaneous melanoma and acral melanoma cells and tissues were determined by qRT-PCR, nucleoplasmic separation assays and fluorescence in situ hybridization. In vitro wound healing, Transwell and 3D invasion assays were used to analyse melanoma cell metastasis ability. Tail vein injection and intrasplenic injection were used to study in vivo lung metastasis and liver metastasis, respectively. The mechanism of circZNF609 was further evaluated via RNA immunoprecipitation, RNA pull-down, silver staining, and immunofluorescence colocalization assays. Results circZNF609 was stably expressed at low levels in melanoma tissues and cells and was negatively correlated with Breslow depth, clinical stage and prognosis of melanoma patients. circZNF609 inhibited metastasis of acral and cutaneous melanoma in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, circZNF609 promoted the binding of FMRP protein and RAC1 mRNA, thereby enhancing the inhibitory effect of FMRP protein on the stability of RAC1 mRNA and ultimately inhibiting melanoma metastasis. Conclusions Our findings revealed that circZNF609 plays a vital role in the metastasis of acral and cutaneous melanoma through the circRNF609-FMRP-RAC1 axis and indicated that circZNF609 regulates the stability of RAC1 mRNA by combining with FMRP, which might provide insight into melanoma pathogenesis and a new potential target for treatment of melanoma.

TI Gonadotropin Signaling in Zebrafish Ovary and Testis Development:
   Insights From Gene Knockout Study
SO MOLECULAR ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB Using the transcription activator-like effectors nucleases-mediated gene knockout technology, we have previously demonstrated that LH signaling is required for oocyte maturation and ovulation but is dispensable for testis development in zebrafish. Here, we have further established the fshb and fshr knockout zebrafish lines. In females, fshb mutant is subfertile, whereas fshr mutant is infertile. Folliculogenesis is partially affected in the fshb mutant but is completely arrested at the primary growth stage in the fshr mutant. In males, fshb and fshr mutant are fertile. The fertilization rate and histological structure of the testis is not affected. However, double knockout of fshb; lhb or fshr; lhr leads to all infertile male offspring. The key steroid hormones and steroidogenic genes are dramatically decreased in double knockout mutant (fshb; lhb and fshr; lhr) but not in single knockout mutant (fshb, lhb, fshr, and lhr) males. Furthermore, we have also demonstrated the constitutive activities of both FSH receptor (FSHR) and LH receptor in zebrafish and the compensatory role of LH by cross-reacting with FSHR in the fshb; lhr double mutant, thus explaining the phenotypic discrepancy observed among the ligand/receptor mutant lines. Taken together, our data established the following models on the roles of gonadotropin signaling in zebrafish gonad development. In females, FSH signaling is mainly responsible for promoting follicular growth, whereas LH signaling is mainly responsible for stimulating oocyte maturation and ovulation. In males, the functions of FSH and LH signaling overlap, and only disruption of both FSH and LH signaling could lead to the infertile phenotype. In the absence of FSH, LH could play a compensatory role by cross-reacting with FSHR in both male and female.

TI Has the Yangtze craton lost its root? A comparison between the North
   China and Yangtze cratons
SO TECTONOPHYSICS
AB A review and comparison of the tectonic history and lithospheric structure of the Yangtze craton and North China craton (NCC) are made to test whether the Yangtze craton has lost part of its lithospheric root like the NCC has, and if so, is there a common driving tectonic force for root-loss. The results show that many similarities and some significant differences exist between these two cratons. The similarities include the following: (1) The eastern parts of the NCC and Yangtze craton have both been destroyed. The destroyed areas are bounded on the west by the North-South Gravity Lineament. (2) Fast velocity bodies located above depths between 200 and 400 km are detected beneath the NCC and Yangtze craton, implying that delamination may be an important mechanism of cratonic destruction for these two cratons. (3) The destruction of the NCC and Yangtze craton can be divided into several stages. The differences mainly lie in the tectonic evolution during Neoproterozoicearly Mesozoic. The tectonothermal events which are beneficial for the lithospheric weakening of the NCC dominantly affected the marginal regions. However, for the Yangtze craton, they are not only limited to the marginal regions, but also extend to the eastern and middle parts of the craton. This may be a key factor why the Yangtze craton shows more continuous slow velocity anomalies.
   We also make a study on the time and dynamic mechanism of the destruction of the Yangtze craton. The results show that the initial destruction started in the Neoproterozoic and may be caused by the aggregation and breakup of Rodinia. The large scale destruction occurred mostly in the Mesozoic (190-90 Ma) with a peak time of 130-120 Ma. The subduction and rollback of the Paleo-Pacific (Izanagi) plate may play a vital role in the destruction of the Yangtze craton. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Fragile-X Syndrome Is Associated With NMDA Receptor Hypofunction and
   Reduced Dendritic Complexity in Mature Dentate Granule Cells
SO FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR NEUROSCIENCE
AB Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability. It is caused by the overexpansion of cytosine-guanine-guanine (CGG) trinucleotide in Fmr1 gene, resulting in complete loss of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Previous studies using Fmr1 knockout (Fmr1 KO) mice have suggested that a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) hypofunction in the hippocampal dentate gyrus may partly contribute to cognitive impairments in FXS. Since activation of NMDAR plays an important role in dendritic arborization during neuronal development, we examined whether deficits in NMDAR function are associated with alterations in dendritic complexity in the hippocampal dentate region. The dentate granule cell layer (GCL) presents active postnatal neurogenesis, and consists of a heterogenous neuronal population with gradient ages from the superficial to its deep layer. Here, we show that neurons with multiple primary dendrites that reside in the outer GCL of Fmr1 KO mice display significantly smaller NMDAR excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) and a higher alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) to NMDA ratio in comparison to their wild-type counterparts. These deficits were associated with a significant decrease in dendritic complexity, with both dendritic length and number of intersections being significantly reduced. In contrast, although neurons with a single primary dendrite resided in the inner GCL of Fmr1 KO mice had a trend toward a reduction in NMDAR EPSCs and a higher AMPA/NMDA ratio, no alterations were found in dendritic complexity at this developmental stage. Our data indicate that the loss of FMRP causes NMDAR deficits and reduced dendritic complexity in granule neurons with multiple primary dendrites which are thought to be more mature in the GCL.

TI Molecular Evolution of the Influenza A Virus Non-structural Protein 1 in
   Interspecies Transmission and Adaptation
SO FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB The non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza A viruses plays important roles in viral fitness and in the process of interspecies adaptation. It is one of the most polymorphic and mutation-tolerant proteins of the influenza A genome, but its evolutionary patterns in different host species and the selective pressures that underlie them are hard to define. In this review, we highlight some of the species-specific molecular signatures apparent in different NS1 proteins and discuss two functions of NS1 in the process of viral adaptation to new host species. First, we consider the ability of NS1 proteins to broadly suppress host protein expression through interaction with CPSF4. This NS1 function can be spontaneously lost and regained through mutation and must be balanced against the need for host co-factors to aid efficient viral replication. Evidence suggests that this function of NS1 may be selectively lost in the initial stages of viral adaptation to some new host species. Second, we explore the ability of NS1 proteins to inhibit antiviral interferon signaling, an essential function for viral replication without which the virus is severely attenuated in any host. Innate immune suppression by NS1 not only enables viral replication in tissues, but also dampens the adaptive immune response and immunological memory. NS1 proteins suppress interferon signaling and effector functions through a variety of protein-protein interactions that may differ from host to host but must achieve similar goals. The multifunctional influenza A virus NS1 protein is highly plastic, highly versatile, and demonstrates a diversity of context-dependent solutions to the problem of interspecies adaptation.

TI Ranking the Criteria Used in the Appraisal of Drugs for Reimbursement: A
   Stated Preferences Elicitation With Health Technology Assessment
   Stakeholders Across Jurisdictional Contexts
SO VALUE IN HEALTH
AB Objectives: Our goal was to estimate the relative importance assigned to health technology assessment (HTA) criteria by stakeholders involved in the HTA process. HTA is an increasingly common framework used in the appraisal of drugs for public reimbursement. It identifies clinical, economic, social, and organizational criteria to be considered. The criteria can vary across jurisdictions and are typically appraised by multidisciplinary expert committees. Guidance on the relative weighing of criteria is often absent.
   Methods: We elicited stakeholders' preferences using a single-scenario discrete choice experiment and a best-worst scaling model with conviction scores to assess the weights assigned to selected criteria by HTA stakeholders. We recruited 111 HTA stakeholders across multiple jurisdictions, including members of expert committees, clinical and economic experts, patients, and public payer representatives. Each judged twelve hypothetical cancer drug profiles for suitability for public funding and identified which characteristics were best and worst. In addition to standard discrete choice experiment and best-worst scaling models, we estimated a hybrid model to obtain a ranking of criteria by importance they played in the appraisal.
   Results: A strong clinical benefit proved the most important criterion, followed by cost considerations, presence of adverse events, and availability of other treatments. The importance of clinical benefit was moderated by unmet need, adverse events, and number of patients.
   Conclusion: Policymakers might want to consider providing an explicit weighing scheme, or moving to a 2-stage selection process with an assessment of the quality of clinical evidence as a gatekeeping step for a full HTA review.

TI ISLAMIC CIVILIZATION IN SPAIN - A MAGNIFICIENT EXAMPLE OF INTERACTION
   AND UNITY OF RELIGION AND SCIENCE
SO PSYCHIATRIA DANUBINA
AB Islam and its followers had created a civilization that played very important role on the world stage for more than a thousand years. One of the most important specific qualities of the Islamic civilization is that it is a well-balanced civilization that brought together science and faith, struck a balance between spirit and matter and did not separate this world from the Hereafter. This is what distinguishes the Islamic civilization from other civilizations which attach primary importance to the material aspect of life, physical needs and human instincts, and attach greater attention to this world by striving to instantly satisfy desires of the flesh, without finding a proper place for God and the Hereafter in their philosophies and education systems. The Islamic civilization drew humankind closer to God, connected the earth and heavens, subordinated this world to the Hereafter, connected spirit and matter, struck a balance between mind and heart, and created a link between science and faith by elevating the importance of moral development to the level of importance of material progress. It is owing to this that the Islamic civilization gave an immense contribution to the development of global civilization.
   Another specific characteristic of the Islamic civilization is that it spread the spirit of justice, impartiality and tolerance among people. The result was that people of different beliefs and views lived together in safety, peace and mutual respect, and that mosques stood next to churches, monasteries and synagogues in the lands that were governed by Muslims. This stems primarily from the commandments of the noble Islam according to which nobody must be forced to convert from their religion and beliefs since freedom of religion is guaranteed within the Islamic order.
   The Islamic civilization in Spain encompasses many fields that left a profound imprint in the Iberian Peninsula and Europe. The cultural climate of Spain in the era of Muslim rule (711-1492) brought about a prospering of different aspects of science and culture. Numerous schools and libraries were established and books were procured due to which the majority of the people were literate. Literature and art flourished. Buildings were constructed and Islamic art with its specific qualities was cultivated. As a result of that movement, Cordoba became the civilization capital of both Spain and the West in general. Many schools were established in it, such as medical and technical schools in addition to the general education and other vocational schools. Hospitals, chemical plants and observatories were also built. The university in Cordoba was a beacon of thought, education and culture, and it made Cordoba the home of science and of a great number of scholars and scientists in medicine, pharmacy, chemistry, astronomy, mathematics and botany. Scholarly disciplines such as philosophy and logic were also studied and busy translation activities were underway. For that reason travelers and people in quest for knowledge and science from different European countries used to come to Cordoba.
   This scientific and civilizational movement was not limited to Cordoba alone, but also spread into other cities of Spain, such as Granada, Toledo and other cities under Islamic rule. Relevant historical sources state that young men from Europe, particularly from Italy and France, competed to enroll some of the Islamic universities in Andalusia. One of the students of the university in Cordoba was Gerbert, who later became known as Pope Sylvester II. He introduced science of mathematics and Arabic numerals in Italy. The same historical sources also read that Europe was acquainted with Aristotle's manuscripts via the city of Toledo which was a center of bustling translation work from the Arabic into the Latin language. It was in Toledo that many works of Plato and Galen were translated, as were the philosophy manuscripts by Ibn Sina, al-Farabi, Ibn Tufayl, Ibn Bajjah and Ibn Rushd, and the medical manuscripts by Ibn Sina and al-Razi. These manuscripts quickly spread all over Europe and became a mandatory literature at great European universities. Ibn Sina's Al-Qanun fi al-tibb was considered the fundamental reference book in studies of medicine in Europe for nearly six centuries and was called The Canon of Medicine. This paper cites numerous examples of interaction and unity of religion and science in the times when Islamic culture and civilization flourished in the Iberian Peninsula, the era that lasted for almost eight centuries.

TI The potential role of N6-methyladenosine modification of LncRNAs in
   contributing to the pathogenesis of chronic glomerulonephritis
SO INFLAMMATION RESEARCH
AB BackgroundIncreasing evidence indicates that N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of mRNAs has been shown to play a critical role in the occurrence and development of many diseases, while little is known about m6A modification in long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs). Our study aims to investigate the potential functions of LncRNA m6A modifications in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse mesangial cells (MMCs), providing us with a new perspective on the molecular mechanisms of chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN) pathogenesis.MethodsDifferentially methylated LncRNAs were identified by Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq). LncRNA-mRNA and LncRNA-associated LncRNA-miRNA-mRNA (CeRNA) networks were constructed by bioinformatics analysis. Furthermore, we utilized gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses (KEGG) to explore target genes from co-expression networks. In addition, the total level of m6A RNA methylation and expression of methyltransferase and pro-inflammatory cytokines were detected by the colorimetric quantification method and western blot, respectively. Cell viability and cell cycle stage were detected by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and flow cytometry.ResultsIn total, 1141 differentially m6A-methylated LncRNAs, including 529 hypermethylated LncRNAs and 612 hypomethylated LncRNAs, were determined by MeRIP-seq. The results of GO and KEGG analysis revealed that the target mRNAs were mainly enriched in signal pathways, such as the NF-kappa B signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, and apoptosis signaling pathway. In addition, higher METTL3 expression was found in CGN kidney tissues using the GEO database. METTL3 knockdown in MMC cells drastically reduced the levels of m6A RNA methylation, pro-inflammatory cytokines IL6 and TNF-alpha, and inhibited cell proliferation and cycle progression.ConclusionsOur findings provide a basis and novel insight for further investigations of m6A modifications in LncRNAs for the pathogenesis of CGN.

TI N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification in the pathophysiology of
   heart failure: a narrative review
SO CARDIOVASCULAR DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPY
AB Background and Objective: Heart failure is the end-stage of various cardiovascular diseases. Recent progress in molecular biology has facilitated the understanding of the mechanisms of heart failure development at the molecular level. N6-adenosine methylation (m6A) is a post-transcriptional modification of RNA. Recent research work reported that m6A regulates gene expression and subsequently affects the activation of cell signaling pathways related to heart failure. Moreover, m6A regulators like methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) were reported to participate in myocardium hypertrophy. However, the current research work related to the role of m6A participating in the occurrence of heart failure is rare in some aspects like immune cell infiltration and diabetic heart diseases. Thus, it is reasonable to review the current achievements and provide further study orientation.Methods: We searched related literature using the keywords: m6A AND heart failure in PubMed, Web of Science and Medline. The language was confined to English. The published year of searched literature ranged from 2012 to 2022. The searched results were put into Endnote software for management. Two authors investigated the searching terms and reviewed the full text of selected terms.Key Content and Findings: m6A and its regulators are involved in the metabolism of various types of RNAs. m6A modification can regulate various types of cell signaling pathways related to the heart failure via interaction with m6A regulators. m6A and its regulators broadly participate in the myocardium fibrosis, myocardium hypertrophy, myocardial cell apoptosis, and ischemic reperfusion injury. Specifically, m6A participates in the cell apoptosis via regulation of autophagy flux. However, the current research work does not have enough evidence to prove that m6A regulator played its specific effect on the target transcript via regulating the m6A level.Conclusions: m6A and its regulators participates in the progression of heart failure via modifying the RNA level. Future investigation of m6A should focus on the interaction between the m6A regulators and targeted transcript. Besides, the regulation role of m6A in immune cell infiltration and diabetic heart diseases should also be focused.

TI Steps on a journey to TB control in Solomon Islands: a cross-sectional,
   mixed methods pre-post evaluation of a local language DVD
SO BMC INTERNATIONAL HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS
AB Background: In Solomon Islands many people with Tuberculosis (TB) have challenges in accessing services because of socio-cultural, geographic and health service reasons, resulting in delays in TB treatment and low detection rates. The purpose of this project was to (i) develop a local language audio-visual resource (DVD) about TB (ii) share this resource with people in remote villages and (iii) evaluate the process and outcomes.
   Methods: The project involved the development and evaluation of a DVD in local Kwaio language. The DVD included five short videos based on the Australian Respiratory Council TB Education Flipchart. The DVD also included short videos of: traditional music/chanting (ai'imae); drama that presented an allegory of TB; and a short documentary on the redevelopment of the local TB Ward.
   A mixed-methods approach evaluated changes in TB knowledge and investigated the impact of the DVD.
   Results: The DVD was recorded and produced in March-June 2013 and screened in 41 villages and hamlets. The pre-post DVD survey was completed by 64% (255/400) of people who viewed the DVD in the villages. Pre-DVD survey responses showed a moderate to high knowledge about TB signs, symptoms and treatment but 76/255 (30%) stated TB was caused by sorcery and 85/255 (33%) incorrectly stated that TB medication should be stopped when a patient feels better.
   The post-DVD survey showed a significant increase in people in coastal villages reporting (i) a 3-week cough would trigger a medical assessment and (ii) TB is mainly spread through the air. Statements that TB is not caused by sorcery increased post-DVD in both coastal and mountain villages, however belief in sorcery in mountain villages remained high at 20/70 (29%).
   Conclusions: The local DVD resource was developed within local cultural understandings and oral traditions of Kwaio people. Using modern but accessible DVD technology generated a lot of interest about the disease and the stories.
   The project evaluation indicates that current delays in seeking treatment may be more due to socio-cultural and health service factors than awareness of the disease. Therefore the development of TB services, including TB education, which are culturally sensitive, remains important.

TI Exploring the value of qualitative research films in clinical education
SO BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION
AB Background: Many healthcare professionals use both quantitative and qualitative research to inform their practice. The usual way to access research findings is through peer-reviewed publications. This study aimed to understand the impact on healthcare professionals of watching and discussing a short research based film. The film, 'Struggling to be me' portrays findings from a qualitative synthesis exploring people's experiences of chronic pain, and was delivered as part of an inter-professional postgraduate e-learning module. The innovation of our study is to be the first to explore the impact of qualitative research portrayed through the medium of film in clinical education.
   Methods: All nineteen healthcare professionals enrolled on the course in December 2013 took part in on-line interviews or focus groups. We recorded and transcribed the interviews verbatim and used the methods of Grounded Theory to analyse the interview transcripts.
   Results: Watching and discussing the film became a stimulus for learning : (a) A glimpse beneath the surface explored a pro-active way of seeing the person behind the pain (b) Pitfalls of the Medical Model recognised the challenge, for both patient and clinician, of 'sitting with' rather than 'fixing' an ill person; (c) Feeling bombarded by despair acknowledged the intense emotions that the clinicians brings to the clinical encounter; (d) Reconstructing the clinical encounter as a shared journey reconstructed the time-constrained clinical encounter as a single step on a shared journey towards healing, rather than fixing.
   Conclusions: Films portraying qualitative research findings can stimulate a pro-active and dialectic form of knowing. Research-based qualitative films can make qualitative findings accessible and can be a useful resource in clinical training. Our research presents, for the first time, specific learning themes for clinical education.

TI Elevated Hu-Antigen Receptor (HuR) Expression is Associated with Tumor
   Aggressiveness and Poor Prognosis but not with COX-2 Expression in
   Invasive Breast Carcinoma Patients
SO PATHOLOGY & ONCOLOGY RESEARCH
AB Hu-antigen R (HuR), a RNA-binding protein, is considered to play a crucial role in tumor development and progression by stabilizing or regulating a group of cellular mRNAs of cancer-related genes, such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). The present study aimed to evaluate the clinical significance of HuR and COX-2 expression in invasive breast carcinoma. HuR and COX-2 protein expression was assessed immunohistochemically on paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissue sections obtained from 121 patients and was statistically analyzed with clinicopathological parameters, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), as well as with tumor cells' proliferative capacity and overall and disease-free patients' survival. High HuR expression was positively associated with larger tumor size and advanced disease stage (p = 0.0234 and p = 0.0361, respectively), being more frequently observed in ER negative cases (p = 0.0208). High COX-2 expression was negatively associated with histological (p < 0.0001) and nuclear (p = 0.0033) grade and tumor cells' proliferative rate (p = 0.0015), being more frequently observed in luminal-A compared to other molecular subtypes (p = 0.0221). High HuR expression was associated with poor overall and disease-free patients' survival at both univariate (log-rank test, p = 0.0092 and p = 0.0004, respectively) and multivariate (Cox-regression analysis, p = 0.0223 and p = 0.0004, respectively) level. On the other hand, high COX-2 expression was associated with favorable overall and disease-free patients' survival merely at univariate level (log-rank test, p = 0.0389 and p = 0.0154, respectively). HuR expression was not associated with COX-2 expression (Spearman R = 0.1489, p = 0.1032). The present data support evidence that HuR is associated with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis in breast carcinoma, reinforcing its potential as promising therapeutic target in this type of neoplasia.

TI Physcomitrium patens pentatricopeptide repeat protein PpPPR_32 is
   involved in the accumulation of psaC mRNA encoding the iron sulfur
   protein of photosystem I
SO GENES TO CELLS
AB Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are involved in RNA metabolism and also play a role in posttranscriptional regulation during plant organellar gene expression. Although a hundred of PPR proteins exist in the moss Physcomitrium patens, their functions are not fully understood. Here, we report the function of P-class PPR protein PpPPR_32 in P. patens. A transient expression assay using green fluorescent protein demonstrated that the N-terminal region of PpPPR_32 functions as a chloroplast-targeting transit peptide, indicating that PpPPR_32 is localized in chloroplasts. PpPPR_32 knockout mutants grew autotrophically but with reduced protonema growth and the poor formation of photosystem I (PSI) complexes. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and RNA gel blot hybridization analyses revealed a significant reduction in the transcript level of the psaC gene encoding the iron sulfur protein of PSI but no alteration to the transcript levels of other PSI genes. This suggests that PpPPR_32 is specifically involved in the expression level of the psaC gene. Our results indicate that PpPPR_32 is essential for the accumulation of psaC transcript and PSI complexes.

TI Experimental evolution links post-transcriptional regulation to
   Leishmania fitness gain
SO PLOS PATHOGENS
AB The protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani causes fatal human visceral leishmaniasis in absence of treatment. Genome instability has been recognized as a driver in Leishmania fitness gain in response to environmental change or chemotherapy. How genome instability generates beneficial phenotypes despite potential deleterious gene dosage effects is unknown. Here we address this important open question applying experimental evolution and integrative systems approaches on parasites adapting to in vitro culture. Phenotypic analyses of parasites from early and late stages of culture adaptation revealed an important fitness tradeoff, with selection for accelerated growth in promastigote culture (fitness gain) impairing infectivity (fitness costs). Comparative genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics analyses revealed a complex regulatory network associated with parasite fitness gain, with genome instability causing highly reproducible, gene dosage-independent and -dependent changes. Reduction of flagellar transcripts and increase in coding and non-coding RNAs implicated in ribosomal biogenesis and protein translation were not correlated to dosage changes of the corresponding genes, revealing a gene dosage-independent, post-transcriptional mechanism of regulation. In contrast, abundance of gene products implicated in post-transcriptional regulation itself correlated to corresponding gene dosage changes. Thus, RNA abundance during parasite adaptation is controled by direct and indirect gene dosage changes. We correlated differential expression of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) with changes in rRNA modification, providing first evidence that Leishmania fitness gain in culture may be controlled by post-transcriptional and epitranscriptomic regulation. Our findings propose a novel model for Leishmania fitness gain in culture, where differential regulation of mRNA stability and the generation of modified ribosomes may potentially filter deleterious from beneficial gene dosage effects and provide proteomic robustness to genetically heterogenous, adapting parasite populations. This model challenges the current, genome-centric approach to Leishmania epidemiology and identifies the Leishmania transcriptome and non-coding small RNome as potential novel sources for the discovery of biomarkers that may be associated with parasite phenotypic adaptation in clinical settings.
   Author summaryGenome instability plays a central yet poorly understood role in human disease. Gene amplifications and deletions drive cancer development, microbial infection and therapeutic failure. The molecular mechanisms that harness the deleterious effects of genome instability to generate beneficial phenotypes in pathogenic systems are unknown. Here we study this important open question in the protozoan parasite Leishmania that causes devastating human diseases termed leishmaniases. Leishmania parasites lack transcriptional control and instead exploit genome instability to adapt to their host environment. Analyzing in vitro adaptation of hamster-derived parasites via gene copy number (genomic level) and gene expression changes (transcriptomic and proteomic levels), we show that these parasites likely exploit small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) to mitigate toxic effects of genome instability by post-transcriptional regulation and the establishment of modified ribosomes. Our findings propose non-coding RNAs as potential novel biomarkers with diagnostic and prognostic value that may be linked to changes in parasite tissue tropism or drug susceptibility. This novel insight into Leishmania adaptation will be likely applicable to other fast evolving eukaryotic systems with unstable genomes, such as fungi or cancer cells.

TI ADAPTATION OF TYPOLOGICAL MODELS OF THE CAPITAL'S PERIODICALS IN THE
   PROVINCIAL PRESS (BY EXAMPLE OF SIBIRSKAYA BRACHNAYA GAZETA, TOMSK,
   1910)
SO VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE
   UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY
AB The article presents the results of a study of the process of adapting the model of the capital's edition in the provincial system of periodicals by the example of two newspapers of the 1910s: Brachnaya gazeta [The Marriage Newspaper] (Moscow) and Sibirskaya brachnaya gazeta [The Siberian Marriage Newspaper] (Tomsk).
   The problems of the typology of periodicals are discussed in many works of modern researchers of journalism that study the practical and theoretical aspects of the typological processes of the Russian and regional periodicals. At the same time, the history of Russian prerevolutionary journalism shows cases when publishers issued periodicals of a certain type, but also borrowed a certain typological publishing model. For example, Sibirskaya brachnaya gazeta, published in Tomsk in the 1910s, was published according to the model of the Moscow Brachnaya gazeta. This allows us to identify the features of the adaptation of the typological model of the capital's edition in the provincial system of periodicals.
   Brachnaya gazeta (1906-1910) was one of the many series of marriage publications, which appeared at the beginning of the 20th century. The newspaper was issued by two women, E.P. Sidorova and M.E. Demenkova. It was an entertaining literary and art publication, filled with original author's materials, reprints and translations devoted mainly to the women's issue and fiction of "sensitive" content. The newspaper issues had a clear structure, in which the first and the last pages contained marriage announcements, while articles, poems and stories were published on the newspaper spread (pages 2 and 3). The newspaper took care of its reputation, insisted that it was serious, since its purpose was not just to acquaint people for a free relationship, but to create a solid family.
   The Tomsk publisher K.V. Shipkov took as a basis the model of Brachnaya gazeta, but in the conditions of Siberia he was forced to change it greatly. The publisher did not have an opportunity to fill the newspaper with original author's material (due to the lack of the sufficient number of authors), so the main part of the newspaper was reprints from Russian newspapers. There were more tabloid, sensational publications (scandals, dramas, catastrophes) and socio-political materials (local chronicles, surveys of Russian life, satirical articles) in Sibirskaya brachnaya gazeta. The ads in the newspaper were also half as many as in Brachnaya gazeta, the Siberian publisher had no opportunity to illustrate the newspaper either. The newspaper did not become commercially successful and was discontinued due to the lack of subscribers.
   Thus, with the same periodicity, price, subscription conditions, the general concept the capital's edition could afford to exist at the expense of private marriage announcements, while filling the publication with author's material on a fairly narrow topic designed for a certain reader. The Siberian newspaper was deprived of such an opportunity. The editor was forced to expand his readership by going beyond the narrow thematic frameworks, looking for other sources of income in addition to marriage announcements. This eroded the harmonious concept of the marriage newspaper, but it is these attempts to transform the type of publication that allow us to talk about adaptation, the adaptation of the typological model to the new conditions, rather than about imitation and uncritical borrowing. The example of Sibirskaya brachnaya gazeta makes it possible to create a "point of entry" into the general research problem of the propagation of typological models from the capital throughout Russia in the prerevolutionary period and the subsequent analysis of this process.

TI The Role of the Three Rs in Improving the Planning and Reproducibility
   of Animal Experiments
SO ANIMALS
AB Simple Summary: Efforts to improve the design of animal studies have tended to focus on the more mathematical aspects, such as randomization, blocking and statistical analysis. There are, however, many other factors that affect the data from preclinical studies. To improve validity, scientists must collaborate closely with the animal facility involved as soon as the decision to use animals has been made. Such discussions will also help to improve animal welfare, as well as any health and safety issues. A large number of guidelines have been produced over the last 20 years for reporting results in the scientific literature. Comprehensive guidelines for planning animal experiments have been produced more recently, to fulfill this need. These will be described in this paper. A commitment to improving animal welfare, scientific quality, staff care and transparency for all stakeholders will also foster a culture of care around animal research, which benefits all parties. All the Three Rs of Russell and Burch (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement) play a role in the planning and reproducibility of research and testing which may involve animals.
   Abstract: Training in the design of animal experiments focuses all too often on those aspects which can be approached mathematically, such as the number of animals needed to deliver a robust result, allocation of group size, and techniques such as randomization, blocking and statistical analysis. Important as they are, these are only a small part of the process of planning animal experiments. Additional key elements include refinements of housing, husbandry and procedures, health and safety, and attention at all stages to animal welfare. Advances in technology and laboratory animal science have led to improvements in care and husbandry, better provision of anesthetics and analgesics, refined methods of drug administration, greater competence in welfare assessment and application of humane endpoints. These improvements require continual dialogue between scientists, facility managers and technical staff, a practice that is a key feature of what has become known as the culture of care. This embodies a commitment to improving animal welfare, scientific quality, staff care and transparency for all stakeholders. Attention to both the physical and mental health of all those directly or indirectly involved in animal research is now an important part of the process of planning and conducting animal experiments. Efforts during the last 30 years to increase the internal and external validity of animal experiments have tended to concentrate on the production of guidelines to improve the quality of reporting animal experiments, rather than for planning them. Recently, comprehensive guidelines for planning animal studies have been published, to redress this imbalance. These will be described in this paper. Endorsement of this overarching influence of the Three R concept, by all the stakeholders, will not only reduce animal numbers and improve animal welfare, but also lead to more reliable and reproducible research which should improve translation of pre-clinical studies into tangible clinical benefit.

TI Coronavirus nsp10/nsp16 Methyltransferase Can Be Targeted by
   nsp10-Derived Peptide In Vitro and In Vivo To Reduce Replication and
   Pathogenesis
SO JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
AB The 5' cap structures of eukaryotic mRNAs are important for RNA stability and protein translation. Many viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of eukaryotes have evolved 2'-O-methyltransferases (2'-O-MTase) to autonomously modify their mRNAs and carry a cap-1 structure (m7GpppNm) at the 5' end, thereby facilitating viral replication and escaping innate immune recognition in host cells. Previous studies showed that the 2'-O-MTase activity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nonstructural protein 16 (nsp16) needs to be activated by nsp10, whereas nsp16 of feline coronavirus (FCoV) alone possesses 2'-O-MTase activity (E. Decroly et al., J Virol 82:8071-8084, 2008, http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JVI.00407-08; M. Bouvet et al., PLoS Pathog 6:e1000863, 2010, http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000863; E. Decroly et al., PLoS Pathog 7:e1002059, 2011, http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002059; Y. Chen et al., PLoS Pathog 7:e1002294, 2011, http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1002294). In this study, we demonstrate that stimulation of nsp16 2'-O-MTase activity by nsp10 is a universal and conserved mechanism in coronaviruses, including FCoV, and that nsp10 is functionally interchangeable in the stimulation of nsp16 of different coronaviruses. Based on our current and previous studies, we designed a peptide (TP29) from the sequence of the interaction interface of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) nsp10 and demonstrated that the peptide inhibits the 2'-O-MTase activity of different coronaviruses in biochemical assays and the viral replication in MHV infection and SARS-CoV replicon models. Interestingly, the peptide TP29 exerted robust inhibitory effects in vivo in MHV-infected mice by impairing MHV virulence and pathogenesis through suppressing virus replication and enhancing type I interferon production at an early stage of infection. Therefore, as a proof of principle, the current results indicate that coronavirus 2'-O-MTase activity can be targeted in vitro and in vivo.
   IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses are important pathogens of animals and human with high zoonotic potential. SARS-CoV encodes the 2'-O-MTase that is composed of the catalytic subunit nsp16 and the stimulatory subunit nsp10 and plays an important role in virus genome replication and evasion from innate immunity. Our current results demonstrate that stimulation of nsp16 2'-O-MTase activity by nsp10 is a common mechanism for coronaviruses, and nsp10 is functionally interchangeable in the stimulation of nsp16 among different coronaviruses, which underlies the rationale for developing inhibitory peptides. We demonstrate that a peptide derived from the nsp16-interacting domain of MHV nsp10 could inhibit 2'-O-MTase activity of different coronaviruses in vitro and viral replication of MHV and SARS-CoV replicon in cell culture, and it could strongly inhibit virus replication and pathogenesis in MHV-infected mice. This work makes it possible to develop broad-spectrum peptide inhibitors by targeting the nsp16/nsp10 2'-O-MTase of coronaviruses.

TI Oscar Wilde's Creative Work in K.I.Chukovsky's Perception
SO MODERN JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE TEACHING METHODS
AB The article analyzes the perception of the biography and works of Oscar Wilde by K.I. Chukovsky, a bright representative of the Western literary Modernism. In previous years, focusing on the popularity of O. Wilde in Russia at the beginning of XX in the context of the development of Modernist trends in Russian literature, researchers tried to search for artistic parallels between the texts of O. Wilde and individual Russian writers. K.I.Chukovsky's literary-critical works contributed to the thoughtful reading of the English writer by a broad readership in Russia. In the article "On the Bourgeois" (1903), K.I.Chukovsky noted the closeness of the themes and stylistics of some works by O. Wilde to descriptions of the social bottom by Gorky, the artistic style of L.N. Andreev and the elegiac tone of A. Chekhov. In the note "O. Wilde and his play" (1904), devoted to the comedy "The Importance of Being Earnest", staged at the London Theater "Court", K.I. Chukovsky described in detail the Wilde's style, pointing out its distinctive features. In terms of content, the most significant work by K.I. Chukovsky about O. Wilde was his sketch "Oscar Wilde" (1911, 1922), which had been repeatedly revised and included into a separate book up to 1966. The essay tells in detail about the childhood of the English writer, held in the salons, which atmosphere became one of the main factors in the formation of Wilde's individuality. In the Russian literature, K.I. Chukovsky was one of the first to find the limitations of O. Wilde's creative work, determined by the principles of esthetic art, oriented to describing the attractive aspects of life, beauty worship, its description and characteristics. In the view of K.I. Chukovsky, it was this vision of reality that caused O. Wilde's greater susceptibility and imitativeness in ways of expressing his creative individuality, as well as in shaping the plot lines of the works. K.I. Chukovsky was also skeptical about O. Wilde's aphorisms, seeing in them both the paradoxical nature of the author's thinking and a certain vacuity, caused by mechanical execution. K.I. Chukovsky considered the specifics of O.Wilde's style, emphasizing the ideological similarity of some of the paradoxes that were opposed to social mores, and F. Nietzsche's morality. At the same time, the critic categorically rejected any deliberate parallels that brought O. Wilde and F. Nietzsche closer together, since O. Wilde's rebellion against everything was significantly different from the titanic struggle, led by the German thinker.

TI Pumilio2-deficient mice show a predisposition for epilepsy
SO DISEASE MODELS & MECHANISMS
AB Epilepsy is a neurological disease that is caused by abnormal hypersynchronous activities of neuronal ensembles leading to recurrent and spontaneous seizures in human patients. Enhanced neuronal excitability and a high level of synchrony between neurons seem to trigger these spontaneous seizures. The molecular mechanisms, however, regarding the development of neuronal hyperexcitability and maintenance of epilepsy are still poorly understood. Here, we show that pumilio RNA-binding family member 2 (Pumilio2; Pum2) plays a role in the regulation of excitability in hippocampal neurons of weaned and 5-month-old male mice. Almost complete deficiency of Pum2 in adult Pum2 gene-trap mice (Pum2 GT) causes misregulation of genes involved in neuronal excitability control. Interestingly, this finding is accompanied by the development of spontaneous epileptic seizures in Pum2 GT mice. Furthermore, we detect an age-dependent increase in Scn1a (Na(v)1.1) and Scn8a (Na(v)1.6) mRNA levels together with a decrease in Scn2a (Na(v)1.2) transcript levels in weaned Pum2 GT that is absent in older mice. Moreover, field recordings of CA1 pyramidal neurons show a tendency towards a reduced paired-pulse inhibition after stimulation of the Schaffer-collateral-commissural pathway in Pum2 GT mice, indicating a predisposition to the development of spontaneous seizures at later stages. With the onset of spontaneous seizures at the age of 5 months, we detect increased protein levels of Na(v)1.1 and Na(v)1.2 as well as decreased protein levels of Na(v)1.6 in those mice. In addition, GABA receptor subunit alpha-2 (Gabra2) mRNA levels are increased in weaned and adult mice. Furthermore, we observe an enhanced GABRA2 protein level in the dendritic field of the CA1 subregion in the Pum2 GT hippocampus. We conclude that altered expression levels of known epileptic risk factors such as Na(v)1.1, Na(v)1.2, Na(v)1.6 and GABRA2 result in enhanced seizure susceptibility and manifestation of epilepsy in the hippocampus. Thus, our results argue for a role of Pum2 in epileptogenesis and the maintenance of epilepsy.

TI Intergenerational Learning and Place-making in a Deindustrialized
   Locality: "Tracks of the Past" in Lanarkshire, Scotland
SO INTERNATIONAL LABOR AND WORKING-CLASS HISTORY
AB This paper contributes to scholarship on the long experience of deindustrialization. It emphasizes contemporary place-making in navigating the much-changed socioeconomic landscapes that the closure of mills, mines, shipyards and factories have left behind. The 'half-life of deindustrialization' suggests these experiences have been received through understandings of labour and community with origins in the industrial era. 'Tracks of the Past' was a school-based education project themed around workers' occupation of Caterpillar's earth-moving machinery plant in Lanarkshire, Scotland. The occupation was a response to Caterpillar's shock closure announcement and the loss of 1,200 jobs. It lasted 103 days between January and April 1987 when closure was reluctantly conceded. A Caterpillar Workers Legacy Group (CWLG) commemorated the occupation's thirtieth anniversary. During 2018, academics collaborated with the CWLG to develop a curriculum for a local high school class. 'Tracks' produced lessons where students engaged with archival sources and physical objects, interviewed members of the CWLG and conducted online research. The 'learning journey' montages that the students produced combined conversations in 2018 with sources from three decades earlier, often reflecting on the occupation as a historical episode in a highly localised context. Others implicated the closure within an international pattern, linking Caterpillar's divestment to the actions of multinationals in the contemporary global economy. In neither case did the invocation of the occupation lead to a straightforward translation of the occupation into contemporary workplace justice issues as the CWLG had hoped. However, these results did suggest a creative deployment of the past that rationalised the occupation with reference to contemporary deindustrialized contexts. These findings demonstrate the utility of the half-life through a lingering industrial past, but also demonstrate the need to conceptualise agents or custodians of labour history and challenge the linearity of passing time that an incrementally receding industrial era implicates.

TI Diverse molecular functions of m(6)A mRNA modification in cancer
SO EXPERIMENTAL AND MOLECULAR MEDICINE
AB N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A), the most prevalent chemical modification found on eukaryotic mRNA, is associated with almost all stages of mRNA metabolism and influences various human diseases. Recent research has implicated the aberrant regulation of m(6)A mRNA modification in many human cancers. An increasing number of studies have revealed that dysregulation of m(6)A-containing gene expression via the abnormal expression of m(6)A methyltransferases, demethylases, or reader proteins is closely associated with tumorigenicity. Notably, the molecular functions and cellular consequences of m(6)A mRNA modification often show opposite results depending on the degree of m(6)A modification in specific mRNA. In this review, we highlight the current progress on the underlying mechanisms of m(6)A modification in mRNA metabolism, particularly the functions of m(6)A writers, erasers, and readers in the context of tumorigenesis.
   Cancer: monitoring messenger RNA modifications A thorough investigation into the role and function of RNA modifications in cancers could yield novel therapies. The chemical modification of messenger RNA (mRNA), the molecule that carries code from DNA to synthesize proteins, is thought to play a role in influencing genetically inherited traits and diseases. A common modification found in mRNA is N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A). Disruption to the regulation of m(6)A modification has been linked with human cancers. Junho Choe and Seung Hun Han at Hanyang University in Seoul, South Korea, reviewed current understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind m(6)A modification, with particular reference to tumor formation. The researchers point out that abnormal expression of proteins associated with m(6)A may lead to heightened expression of cancer-related genes. More extensive m(6)A modification levels are also linked to tumor formation.

TI Effects of ER alpha-specific antagonist on mouse preimplantation embryo
   development and zygotic genome activation
SO JOURNAL OF STEROID BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB Zygotic genome activation (ZGA) is essential for normal development of mammalian preimplantation embryos. Estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) has been implicated in early embryogenesis, and controls the expression of genes associated with proliferation, differentiation and development of cell and target organs via a genomic effect. The objective of this study was to determine whether ER alpha plays a role in early embryo development and affects ZGA gene expression. Toward this objective, 1-cell embryos from B6C3F1 mouse were cultured with the antiestrogen ICI182780, ER alpha-specific antagonist MPP, ER alpha-specific antibody and ER beta-specific antagonist PHTPP. Development of 2-cell to 4-cell in vitro was significantly blocked by ICI182780, MPP and ER alpha-antibody treatment in a dose-dependent manner but not affected by PHTPP exposure. MPP decreased nuclear ER alpha protein levels and reduced mRNA expression levels of MuERV-L, one of the ZGA related genes. The results indicate that ERa has a functional role in early embryo development by regulation of ZGA-related genes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Lessons for Inductive Germline Determination
SO MOLECULAR REPRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Formation of the germline in an embryo marks a fresh round of reproductive potential, yet the developmental stage and location within the embryo where the primordial germ cells (PGCs) form differs wildly among species. In most animals, the germline is formed either by an inherited mechanism, in which maternal provisions within the oocyte drive localized germ-cell fate once acquired in the embryo, or an inductive mechanism that involves signaling between cells that directs germ-cell fate. The inherited mechanism has been widely studied in model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Xenopus laevis, and Danio rerio. Given the rapid generation time and the effective adaptation for laboratory research of these organisms, it is not coincidental that research on these organisms has led the field in elucidating mechanisms for germline specification. The inductive mechanism, however, is less well understood and is studied primarily in the mouse (Mus musculus). In this review, we compare and contrast these two fundamental mechanisms for germline determination, beginning with the key molecular determinants that play a role in the formation of germ cells across all animal taxa. We next explore the current understanding of the inductive mechanism of germ-cell determination in mice, and evaluate the hypotheses for selective pressures on these contrasting mechanisms. We then discuss the hypothesis that the transition between these determination mechanisms, which has happened many times in phylogeny, is more of a continuum than a binary change. Finally, we propose an analogy between germline determination and sex determination in vertebratestwo of the milestones of reproduction and developmentin which animals use contrasting strategies to activate similar pathways.

TI Reverse complementary matches simultaneously promote both back-splicing
   and exon-skipping
SO BMC GENOMICS
AB Background Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play diverse roles in different biological and physiological environments and are always expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Especially, circRNAs are enriched in the brain tissues of almost all investigated species, including humans, mice, Drosophila, etc. Although circRNAs were found in C. elegans, the neuron-specific circRNA data is not available yet. Exon-skipping is found to be correlated to circRNA formation, but the mechanisms that link them together are not clear. Results Here, through large-scale neuron isolation from the first larval (L1) stage of C. elegans followed by RNA sequencing with ribosomal RNA depletion, the neuronal circRNA data in C. elegans were obtained. Hundreds of novel circRNAs were annotated with high accuracy. circRNAs were highly expressed in the neurons of C. elegans and were positively correlated to the levels of their cognate linear mRNAs. Disruption of reverse complementary match (RCM) sequences in circRNA flanking introns effectively abolished circRNA formation. In the zip-2 gene, deletion of either upstream or downstream RCMs almost eliminated the production of both the circular and the skipped transcript. Interestingly, the 13-nt RCM in zip-2 is highly conserved across five nematode ortholog genes, which show conserved exon-skipping patterns. Finally, through in vivo one-by-one mutagenesis of all the splicing sites and branch points required for exon-skipping and back-splicing in the zip-2 gene, I showed that back-splicing still happened without exon-skipping, and vice versa. Conclusions Through protocol optimization, total RNA obtained from sorted neurons is increased to hundreds of nanograms. circRNAs highly expressed in the neurons of C. elegans are more likely to be derived from genes also highly expressed in the neurons. RCMs are abundant in circRNA flanking introns, and RCM-deletion is an efficient way to knockout circRNAs. More importantly, these RCMs are not only required for back-splicing but also promote the skipping of exon(s) to be circularized. Finally, RCMs in circRNA flanking introns can directly promote both exon-skipping and back-splicing, providing a new explanation for the correlation between them.

TI Systematic analysis of NAC transcription factors' gene family and
   identification of post-flowering drought stress responsive members in
   sorghum
SO PLANT CELL REPORTS
AB Key messageSbNAC genes (131) encoding 183 proteins were identified from the sorghum genome and characterized. The expression patterns of SbSNACs were evaluated at three sampling time points under post-flowering drought stress.AbstractNAC proteins are specific transcription factors in plants, playing vital roles in development and response to various environmental stresses. Despite the fact that Sorghum bicolor is well-known for its drought-tolerance, it suffers from grain yield loss due to pre and post-flowering drought stress. In the present study, 131 SbNAC genes encoding 183 proteins were identified from the sorghum genome. The phylogenetic trees were constructed based on the NAC domains of sorghum, and also based on sorghum with Arabidopsis and 8 known NAC domains of other plants, which classified the family into 15 and 19 subfamilies, respectively. Based on the obtained results, 13 SbNAC proteins joined the SNAC subfamily, and these proteins are expected to be involved in response to abiotic stresses. Promoter analysis revealed that all SbNAC genes comprise different stress-associated cis-elements in their promoters. UTRs analysis indicated that 101 SbNAC transcripts had upstream open reading frames, while 39 of the transcripts had internal ribosome entry sites in their 5UTR. Moreover, 298 miRNA target sites were predicted to exist in the UTRs of SbNAC transcripts. The expression patterns of SbSNACs were evaluated in three genotypes at three sampling time points under post-flowering drought stress. Based on the results, it could be suggested that some gene members are involved in response to drought stress at the post-flowering stage since they act as positive or negative transcriptional regulators. Following further functional analyses, some of these genes might be perceived to be promising candidates for breeding programs to enhance drought tolerance in crops.

TI Cx43 Present at the Leading Edge Membrane Governs Promigratory Effects
   of Osteoblast-Conditioned Medium on Human Prostate Cancer Cells in the
   Context of Bone Metastasis
SO CANCERS
AB Simple Summary
   In its late stages, prostate cancer (PCa) is characterized by a high propensity to form osteoblastic bone metastases, mainly treated by palliative approaches. In a previous work, we demonstrated that a gap junctional protein, connexin43 (Cx43) is implicated both in the increase of aggressiveness of PCa cells and in their impact on bone. To analyze the reciprocal part of the dialogue, the current study addresses the role of Cx43 in the impact of bone microenvironment on PCa cells abilities. Using Cx43-overexpressing PCa cell lines, we determined that Cx43 is necessary for promigratory effect induced by osteoblastic conditioned media (ObCM) on individual cells. Next, we demonstrated the requirement of Cx43 membrane localization at the leading edge and the involvement of the cytoplasmic part in this ObCM-induced migration. Overall, our findings precise the role of Cx43 during PCa progression and its putative use as aggressiveness marker and as potential therapeutic targets.
   Among the different interacting molecules implicated in bone metastases, connexin43 (Cx43) may increase sensitivity of prostate cancer (PCa) cells to bone microenvironment, as suggested by our in silico and human tissue samples analyses that revealed increased level of Cx43 expression with PCa progression and a Cx43 specific expression in bone secondary sites. The goal of the present study was to understand how Cx43 influences PCa cells sensitivity and aggressiveness to bone microenvironment. By means of Cx43-overexpressing PCa cell lines, we revealed a Cx43-dependent promigratory effect of osteoblastic conditioned media (ObCM). This effect on directional migration relied on the presence of Cx43 at the plasma membrane and not on gap junctional intercellular communication and hemichannel functions. ObCM stimulation induced Rac1 activation and Cx43 interaction with cortactin in protrusions of migrating PCa cells. Finally, by transfecting two different truncated forms of Cx43 in LNCaP cells, we determined that the carboxy terminal (CT) part of Cx43 is crucial for the responsiveness of PCa cells to ObCM. Our study demonstrates that Cx43 level and its membrane localization modulate the phenotypic response of PCa cells to osteoblastic microenvironment and that its CT domain plays a pivotal role.

TI SARS-CoV-2 suppresses IFN beta production mediated by NSP1, 5, 6, 15,
   ORF6 and ORF7b but does not suppress the effects of added interferon
SO PLOS PATHOGENS
AB Type I Interferons (IFN-Is) are a family of cytokines which play a major role in inhibiting viral infection. Resultantly, many viruses have evolved mechanisms in which to evade the IFN-I response. Here we tested the impact of expression of 27 different SARS-CoV-2 genes in relation to their effect on IFN production and activity using three independent experimental methods. We identified six gene products; NSP6, ORF6, ORF7b, NSP1, NSP5 and NSP15, which strongly (>10-fold) blocked MAVS-induced (but not TRIF-induced) IFN beta production. Expression of the first three of these SARS-CoV-2 genes specifically blocked MAVS-induced IFN beta -promoter activity, whereas all six genes induced a collapse in IFN beta mRNA levels, corresponding with suppressed IFN beta protein secretion. Five of these six genes furthermore suppressed MAVS-induced activation of IFN lambda s, however with no effect on IFN alpha or IFN gamma production. In sharp contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infected cells remained extremely sensitive to anti-viral activity exerted by added IFN-Is. None of the SARS-CoV-2 genes were able to block IFN-I signaling, as demonstrated by robust activation of Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISGs) by added interferon. This, despite the reduced levels of STAT1 and phospho-STAT1, was likely caused by broad translation inhibition mediated by NSP1. Finally, we found that a truncated ORF7b variant that has arisen from a mutant SARS-CoV-2 strain harboring a 382-nucleotide deletion associating with mild disease (Delta 382 strain identified in Singapore & Taiwan in 2020) lost its ability to suppress type I and type III IFN production. In summary, our findings support a multi-gene process in which SARS-CoV-2 blocks IFN-production, with ORF7b as a major player, presumably facilitating evasion of host detection during early infection. However, SARS-CoV-2 fails to suppress IFN-I signaling thus providing an opportunity to exploit IFN-Is as potential therapeutic antiviral drugs.
   Author summary Our immune system provides the first-line of defense to combat viral infection through the localized triggering of Type I Interferons (IFN-Is). This is a family of cytokines which send a localized "red alert" signal to both infected and adjacent cells, activating hundreds of antiviral genes thus triggering a major arm of innate immunity. So important are IFN-Is, that it is perhaps not surprising that many viruses have evolved mechanisms to block the triggering of IFN-I production and sometimes to additionally block IFN-I signaling. Herein we have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID19, harbors six genes that block the production of IFN beta, a major subtype of IFN-Is. However, even though SARS-CoV-2 infection had the capacity to strongly decrease pSTAT1, a lynchpin molecule required to disseminate IFN-I signaling, enough residual pSTAT1 remained to allow activation of the anti-viral program. Our findings demonstrate that this coronavirus has devoted a significant proportion of its genome to block IFN-I production, presumably in order to help it establish early stage infection. Nevertheless, this virus remains sensitive to the effects of added interferon, providing an opportunity to treat COVID19 patients with IFN-Is therapeutically.

TI Cross-Cultural Adaptation of the Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining
   Treatment Form to Brazil
SO JOURNAL OF PALLIATIVE MEDICINE
AB Background: The Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) paradigm is considered one of the most important strategies to respect patients' values at the end of life in the United States. The cross-cultural adaptation of POLST entailed several methodological considerations, which may be informative for international researchers who may also consider bringing POLST to their countries as a means to promote care at the end of life that is consistent with patients' preferences.
   Objective: To report the methods and outcome of the cross-cultural adaptation of the POLST form to Brazil.
   Design: Cross-cultural adaptation study.
   Setting/Subjects: Twenty physicians and 10 patients at a university hospital participated in the pilot tests.
   Results: The cross-cultural adaptation process included choosing which existing POLST form(s) to use as a source, deciding the intended reading level, which healthcare professionals should be allowed to sign the form, and consultation with attorneys, bioethicists, and members of the National POLST Paradigm Task Force. Pilot tests occurred in two stages using different approaches. First, 20 physicians were trained about POLST and asked for any unclear aspects related to the form. Second, trained investigators completed POLST forms after engaging in advance care planning conversations with 10 hospitalized patients or patients' surrogates.
   Conclusions: This report provides a basis for future cross-cultural adaptations of POLST to other countries. The authors hope such new adaptations will broaden the possibilities of research using POLST and also may promote wider provision of care at the end of life that is consistent with patients' preferences.

TI Personality Dimensions and Their Behavioral Correlates in Wild Virunga
   Mountain Gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei)
SO JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY
AB Studies of animal personality improve our understanding of individual variation in measures of life history and fitness, such as health and reproductive success. Using a 54 trait personality questionnaire developed for studying great apes and other nonhuman primates, we obtained ratings on 116 wild mountain gorillas ( Gorilla beringei beringei) monitored by the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund's Karisoke Research Center in Rwanda. There were 8 raters who each had more than 1.5 years of working experience with the subjects. Principal component analyses identified 4 personality dimensions with high interrater reliabilities-Dominance, Openness, Sociability, and Proto-Agreeableness-that reflected personality features unique to gorillas and personality features shared with other hominoids. We next examined the associations of these dimensions with independently collected behavioral measures derived from long-term records. Predicted correlations were found between the personality dimensions and corresponding behaviors. For example, Dominance, Openness, Sociability, and Proto-Agreeableness were related to gorilla dominance strength, time spent playing, rates of approaches, and rates of interventions in intragroup conflicts, respectively. These findings enrich the comparative-evolutionary study of personality and provide insights into how species differences in personality are related to ecology, social systems, and life history.

TI The effect of local sympatholysis on bone-tendon interface healing in a
   murine rotator cuff repair model
SO JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC TRANSLATION
AB Background: Although neuroregulation plays an important role in tissue healing, the key neuroregulatory path-ways and related neurotransmitters involved in bone-tendon interface (BTI) healing are still unknown. It is re-ported that sympathetic nerves can regulate cartilage and bone metabolism, which are the basic aspects of BTI repair after injury, through the release of norepinephrine (NE). Thus, the purpose of this study was to explore the effect of local sympatholysis (LS) on BTI healing in a murine rotator cuff repair model.Methods: Specifically, C57BL/6 mice underwent unilateral supraspinatus tendon (SST) detachment and repair was established on a total of 174 mature C57BL/6 mice (12 weeks old): 54 mice were used to examine the sympathetic fibers and its neurotransmitter NE for the representation of sympathetic innervation of BTI, while the rest of them were randomly allocated into (LS) group and control group to verify the effect of sympathetic denervation during BTI healing. The LS group were intervened with fibrin sealant containing 10 ng/ml guanethidine, while the control group received fibrin sealant only. Mice were euthanized at postoperative 2, 4 and 8 weeks for immu-nofluorescent, qRT-PCR, ELISA, Micro-computed tomography (CT), histology and biomechanical evaluations.Results: Immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR and ELISA evaluations indicated that there were the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), NE and beta 2-adrenergic receptor (beta 2-AR) at the BTI site. All the above showed a trend of increasing at the early postoperative stage and they started to decrease with the healing time after a significant peak. Meanwhile, local sympathetic denervation of BTI was achieved after the use of guanethidine as shown in the NE ELISA outcomes in two groups. QRT-PCR analysis revealed that the healing interface in the LS group expressed more transcription factors, such as Runx2, Bmp2, Sox9, and Aggrecan, than the control group. Further, radio-graphic data showed that the LS group significantly possessed higher bone volume fraction (BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb.N), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), and lower trabecular spacing (Tb.Sp) than the control group. Also, histological test results showed that there was more fibrocartilage regenerated at the healing interface in the LS group compared with the control group. Mechanical testing results demonstrated that the failure load, ultimate strength and stiffness in the LS group were significantly higher at postoperative week 4 (P < 0.05), but not at postoperative week 8 (P > 0.05), compared to the control group.Conclusion: The regulation of sympathetic innervation was involved in the healing process of injured BTI, and local sympathetic denervation by using guanethidine was beneficial for BTI healing outcomes.The translational potential of this article: This is the first study to evaluate the expression and specific role of sympathetic innervation during BTI healing. The findings of this study also imply that the antagonists of beta 2-AR could serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for BTI healing. Also, we firstly successfully constructed a local sympathetic denervation mouse model by using guanethidine loaded fibrin sealant, which provided a new effective methodology for future neuroskeletal biology study.

TI Transcriptome-wide study revealed m6A regulation of embryonic muscle
   development in Dingan goose (Anser cygnoides orientalis)
SO BMC GENOMICS
AB Background The number of myofiber is determined during the embryonic stage and does not increase during the postnatal period for birds, including goose. Thus, muscle production of adult goose is pre-determined during embryogenesis. Previous studies show N-6-methyladenosine (m6A) is an important regulator for skeletal muscle development of birds and miRNAs play as a co-regulator for the skeletal muscle development in birds. Herein, we sequenced m6A and miRNA transcriptomes to investigate the profiles of m6A and their potential mechanism of regulating breast muscle development in Dingan Goose. Results We selected embryonic 21th day (E21) and embryonic 30th day (E30) to investigate the roles of transcriptome-wide m6A modification combining with mRNAs and miRNAs in goose breast muscle development. In this study, m6A peaks were mainly enriched in coding sequence (CDS) and start codon and397 genes were identified as differentially methylated genes (DMGs). GO and KEGG analysis showed that DMGs were highly related to cellular and metabolic process and that most DMGs were enriched in muscle-related pathways including Wnt signaling pathway, mTOR signaling and FoxO signaling pathway. Interestingly, a negative correlation between m6A methylation level and mRNA abundance was found through the analysis of m6A-RNA and RNA-seq data. Besides, we found 26 muscle-related genes in 397 DMGs. We also detected 228 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs), and further found 329 genes shared by the target genes of DEMs and DMGs (m6A-miRNA-genes), suggesting a tightly relationship between DEMs and DMGs. Among the m6A-miRNA-genes, we found 10 genes are related to breast muscle development. We further picked out an m6A-miRNA-gene, PDK3, from the 10 genes to visualize it and the result showed differentially methylated peaks on the mRNA transcript consistent with our m6A-seq results. Conclusion GO and KEGG of DMGs between E21 and E30 showed most DMGs were muscle-related. In total, 228 DEMs were found, and the majority of DMGs were overlapped with the targets of DEGs. The differentially methylated peaks along with an m6A-miRNA-gene, PDK3, showed the similar results with m6A-seq results. Taken together, the results presented here provide a reference for further investigation of embryonic skeletal muscle development mechanism in goose.

TI Psychometric Properties of Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire-15 for
   Predicting Suicidal Ideation among Migrant Industrial Workers in China
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Objective: Interpersonal theories of suicide suggest that the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire (INQ) can be used to measure suicidal ideation, but few studies have focused on migrant people, a group with a high prevalence of suicidal ideation. The aim of this study was to validate the psychometric properties of the INQ-15 and its prediction of suicidal ideation among migrant industrial workers in China. Method: A stratified multi-stage sample of 2023 industrial workers was recruited from 16 factories in Shenzhen, China. There were 1805 nonlocal workers, which we defined as migrant workers with a mean age of 32.50 +/- 8.43 years old who were 67.3% male. The structure of the Chinese version of the INQ-15 and its correlation and predictive utility for suicidal ideation were examined through factor analysis, the Item Response Theory, the M2 test, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: Different from studies among various samples in which a two-factor solution is identified, results within this sample indicated three factors: perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, and social isolation. The model fit statistics of three-factor INQ were 0.075 for RMSEA, 0.945 for CFI, 0.932 for TLI, and 0.067 for SRMR. The model standard estimated factor loadings ranged from 0.366 to 0.869. The summed scores of INQ and perceived burdensomeness predicted suicidal ideation after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics such as age, gender, and income with AUC of 0.733 (95% CI: 0.712/0.754) and 0.786 (95% CI: 0.766/0.804). In the meantime, the comparison of the predictive ability between INQ total scores and PB scores was significant with p < 0.05. Conclusion: The INQ has good psychometric properties and can be used to assess how migrant workers living in the Shenzhen perceive meeting interpersonal psychological needs and shows good predictive ability of suicidal ideation. Perceived burdensomeness appears to play a role in suicide and may be a point of intervention, yet the notable deviation from previous findings and the relative weakness of two of the other factors warrant further study.

TI MicroRNA and cellular targets profiling reveal miR-217 and miR-576-3p as
   proviral factors during Oropouche infection
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB Oropouche Virus is the etiological agent of an arbovirus febrile disease that affects thousands of people and is widespread throughout Central and South American countries. Although isolated in 1950's, still there is scarce information regarding the virus biology and its prevalence is likely underestimated. In order to identify and elucidate interactions with host cells factors and increase the understanding about the Oropouche Virus biology, we performed microRNA (miRNA) and target genes screening in human hepatocarcinoma cell line HuH-7. Cellular miRNAs are short non-coding RNAs that regulates gene expression post-transcriptionally and play key roles in several steps of viral infections. The large scale RT-qPCR based screening found 13 differentially expressed miRNAs in Oropouche infected cells. Further validation confirmed that miR-217 and miR-576-3p were 5.5 fold up-regulated at early stages of virus infection (6 hours post-infection). Using bioinformatics and pathway enrichment analysis, we predicted the cellular targets genes for miR-217 and miR-576-3p. Differential expression analysis of RNA from 95 selected targets revealed genes involved in innate immunity modulation, viral release and neurological disorder outcomes. Further analysis revealed the gene of decapping protein 2 (DCP2), a previous known restriction factor for bunyaviruses transcription, as a miR-217 candidate target that is progressively down-regulated during Oropouche infection. Our analysis also showed that activators genes involved in innate immune response through IFN-beta pathway, as STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes) and TRAF3 (TNF-Receptor Associated Factor 3), were down-regulated as the infection progress. Inhibition of miR-217 or miR-576-3p restricts OROV replication, decreasing viral RNA (to up 8.3 fold) and virus titer (3 fold). Finally, we showed that virus escape IFN-beta mediated immune response increasing the levels of cellular miR-576-3p resulting in a decreasing of its partners STING and TRAF3. We concluded stating that the present study, the first for a Peribunyaviridae member, gives insights in its prospective pathways that could help to understand virus biology, interactions with host cells and pathogenesis, suggesting that the virus escapes the antiviral cellular pathways increasing the expression of cognates miRNAs.

TI Monosaccharide-mediated rational synthesis of a universal plasmonic
   platform with broad spectral fluorescence enhancement for
   high-sensitivity cancer biomarker analysis
SO JOURNAL OF NANOBIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Background: Effective and accurate screening of oncological biomarkers in peripheral blood circulation plays an increasingly vital role in diagnosis and prognosis. High-sensitivity assays can effectively aid clinical decision-making and intervene in cancer in a localized status before they metastasize and become unmanageable. Meanwhile, it is equally pivotal to prevent overdiagnosis of non-life-threatening cancer by eliminating unnecessary treatment and repeated blood draws. Unfortunately, current clinical screening methodologies can hardly simultaneously attain sufficient sensitivity and specificity, especially under resource-restrained circumstances. To circumvent such limitations, particularly for cancer biomarkers from early-onset and recurrence, we aim to develop a universal plasmonic platform for clinical applications, which macroscopically amplifies multiplexed fluorescence signals in a broad spectral window and readily adapts to current assay setups without sophisticated accessories or expertise at low cost.
   Methods: The plasmonic substrate was chemically synthesized in situ at the solid-liquid interface by rationally screening a panel of reducing monosaccharides and tuning the redox reactions at various catalyst densities and precursor concentrations. The redox properties were studied by Benedict's assay and electrochemistry. We systemically characterized the morphologies and optical properties of the engineered plasmonic Ag structures by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and spectroscopy. The structure-fluorescence enhancement correlation was explicitly explained by the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation and a computational model for gap distribution. Next, we established an enhanced fluoroimmunoassay (eFIA) using a model biomarker for prostate cancer (PCa) and validated it in healthy and PCa cohorts. Prognosis was explored in patients subject to surgical and hormonal interventions following recommended PCa guidelines.
   Results: The monosaccharide-mediated redox reaction yielded a broad category of Ag structures, including sparsely dispersed nanoparticles (NPs) of various sizes, semi-continuous nanoislands, and crackless continuous films. Optimal broad-spectral fluorescence enhancement from green to far-red was observed for the inhomogeneous, irregularly-shaped semi-continuous Ag nanoisland substrate (AgNIS), synthesized from a well-balanced redox reaction at a stable rate mediated by mannose. In addition, different local electric field intensity distributions in response to various incident excitations were observed at the nanoscale, elucidating the need for irregular and inhomogeneous structures. AgNIS enabled a maximized 54.7-fold macroscopically amplified fluorescence and long-lasting photostability. Point-of-care availability was fulfilled using a customized smartphone prototype with well-paired optics. The eFIA effectively detected the PCa marker in cell lines, xenograft tumors, and patient sera. The plasmonic platform rendered a diagnostic sensitivity of 86.0% and a specificity of 94.7% and capably staged high-grade PCa that the clinical gold standard test failed to stratify. Patient prognosis of robotic-assisted surgeries and hormone therapies was non-invasively monitored following efficient medical interventions. The assay time was significantly curtailed on the plasmonic platform upon microwave irradiation.
   Conclusions: By investigating the effects of reducing monosaccharides on the seed-mediated chemical synthesis of plasmonic Ag structures, we deduced that potent multiplexed fluorescence enhancement originated from both an adequate reducing power and a steady reduction rate. Furthermore, the inhomogeneous structure with adequate medium gap distances afforded optimal multiwavelength fluorescence enhancement, thus empowering an effective eFIA for PCa. The clinically validated diagnostic and prognostic features, along with the low sample volume, point-of-care feasibility with a smartphone, and microwave-shortened assay time, warrant its potential clinical translation for widespread cancer biomarker analysis.

TI Human epidemiological evidence about the associations between exposure
   to organochlorine chemicals and endometriosis: Systematic review and
   meta-analysis
SO ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB Background: Endometriosis is a gynaecological disease characterized by the presence of ectopic endometrial tissue that affects women during their reproductive years, having a strong impact on their lives, fertility and healthcare costs. The aetiology remains largely unknown, but current evidence suggests that it is multi-causal and oestrogen-dependent. Many epidemiologic studies have explored associations between organochlorine chemicals (OCCs) and endometriosis, but the findings are inconsistent.
   Objectives: A systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis were conducted to gather and synthesize all the available evidence from human epidemiological studies about the associations between OCCs and endometriosis. Data sources: The searches were conducted in PubMed and Web of Science in June 2016 with a final follow-up in August 2018.
   Study eligibility criteria: Only human epidemiological studies were considered, independent of participant age, body mass index or life-stage. Studies reporting individual measures of exposure to OCCs were included, considering but not limited to polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated bi-phenyls (PCBs), or organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). The primary health outcome was presence of endometriosis, including all sub-types. Eligibility criteria excluded articles not written in English, conference papers, reviews and studies with overlapping information.
   Study appraisal and synthesis methods: A SR protocol pre-registered at PROSPERO was applied in duplicate to gather and extract all eligible original papers from PUBMED and Web of Science databases. Odds ratios were pooled using the inverse variance method for random effects meta-analysis for each group of OCCs. Risk of bias was assessed using the National Toxicology Program/Office of Health Assessment and Translation (NTP/ OHAT) Risk of Bias Rating Tool for Human and Animal Studies adapted to the review question. The confidence in the body of evidence and related level of evidence was measured by using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) based NTP/ OHAT framework. The results were structured and presented in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
   Results: Of the 51 studies retained for the full-text screening, 17 provided effect sizes and metrics sufficient for pooling estimates through meta-analysis. The overall odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were 1.65 (1.14; 2.39) for dioxins (n=10), 1.70 (1.20; 2.39) for PCBs (n=9), and 1.23 (1.13; 1.36) for OCPs (n=5). Despite being statistically significant, these estimates should be considered with caution given the notable heterogeneity and small estimated effect size. Misclassification of exposure, due to varying laboratory detection rate capabilities, and disease status, due to varying definitions of endometriosis, were identified as major sources of uncertainty.
   Limitations, conclusions, and implications of key findings: The level of evidence was considered to be "moderate" with "serious" risk of bias according the NTP/OHAT criteria, supporting the need for further well-designed epidemiological research to fill lingering data gaps. Given the complexity of endometriosis and lack of known biomarkers suitable for population-based research, carefully designed observational studies play an important role in better understanding the aetiology of endometriosis, as will evolving mixture modeling approaches capable of handling various environmental chemical exposures. Attention to critical windows of exposure will shed further light on the possible developmental origin of endometriosis. Considering the high economic and societal cost associated with endometriosis, further research on this field is urged.

TI The SMN1 common variant c.22 dupA in Chinese patients causes spinal
   muscular atrophy by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay in humans
SO GENE
AB Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a common autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder that is mostly caused by homozygous deletion of the SMN1 gene. Approximately 5%-10% of SMA patients are believed to have SMN1 variants. c.22 dupA (p.Ser8lysfs*23) has been identified as the most frequent variant in the Chinese SMA population and to be associated with a severe phenotype. However, the exact molecular mechanism of the variant on the pathogenesis of SMA is unclear. We observed that SMN1 mRNA and the SMN protein in the peripheral blood cells of a patient with c.22 dupA were lower than those of controls. The aim of this study is to investigate whether nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) plays a role in the mechanism of the c.22 dupA variant of the SMN1 gene as it causes SMA. Two lymphoblasts cell lines from two patients (patient 1 and 2) with the c.22 dupA, and one dermal fibroblasts cell line from patient 2 were included in our study. Two-stage validation of the NMD mechanism was supplied. We first measured the changes in the transcript levels of the SMN1 gene by real-time quantitative PCR after immortalized B-lymphoblasts and dermal fibroblasts cells of the SMA patients were treated with inhibitors of the NMD pathway, including puromycin and cyclohemide. Next, lentivirus-mediated knockdown of the key NMD factor-Up-frameshift protein 1 (UPF1)-was performed in the fibroblasts cell line to further clarify whether the variant led to NMD, as UPF1 recognizes abnormally terminated transcripts as NMD substrates during translation. SC35 1.7-kb transcripts, a physiological NMD substrate was determined to be a NMD positive gene in our experiments. The two inhibitors resulted in a dramatic escalation of the levels of the full-length SMN1 (ft-SMN1) transcripts. Additionally, the SC35 1.7-kb mRNA levels were also increased, suggesting that NMD pathway is suppressed by the two inhibitors. For the 3 cell lines, the fold increase of the SMN1 transcript levels of cycloheximide ranged from 2.5 +/- 0.4 to 8.3 +/- 0.1, 1.9 +/- 0.2 to 5.0 +/- 0.7 and 2.2 +/- 0.1 to 4.9 +/- 0.2 for two lymphoblastoid cell lines and one fibroblasts cell line, respectively. For these cell lines, the fold increases of the SMN1 transcript levels of puromycin were as follows: 5.5 +/- 0.2 to 19.5 +/- 4.0, 3.1 +/- 0.3 to 9.9 +/- 1.8 and 1.5 +/- 0.2 to 6.5 +/- 0.5. Meanwhile, the SC35 1.7-kb transcript levels were markedly increased in all 3 cell lines. In addition, lentivirus-mediated UPF1 knockdown lead to a reduction of the UPF1 protein level to 22.5% compared to the negative control lentivirus. Additionally, knockdown of the UPF1 gene also promoted mRNA expression of the SC35 1.7kb and fl-SMN1 genes. The increases of the SMN1 and SC35 1.7-kb mRNA levels reached about 4- and 6.5-fold in fibroblasts derived from the patient 2, respectively. Altogether, our study provides the first evidence that the c.22 dupA variant in the SMN1 gene triggers NMD. SMA pathogenesis in the patient is associated with mRNA degradation of SMN1, but not the truncated SMN protein.

TI A functional conserved intronic G run in HIV-1 intron 3 is critical to
   counteract APOBEC3G-mediated host restriction
SO RETROVIROLOGY
AB Background: The HIV-1 accessory proteins, Viral Infectivity Factor (Vif) and the pleiotropic Viral Protein R (Vpr) are important for efficient virus replication. While in non-permissive cells an appropriate amount of Vif is critical to counteract APOBEC3G-mediated host restriction, the Vpr-induced G2 arrest sets the stage for highest transcriptional activity of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat.
   Both vif and vpr mRNAs harbor their translational start codons within the intron bordering the non-coding leader exons 2 and 3, respectively. Intron retention relies on functional cross-exon interactions between splice sites A1 and D2 (for vif mRNA) and A2 and D3 (for vpr mRNA). More precisely, prior to the catalytic step of splicing, which would lead to inclusion of the non-coding leader exons, binding of U1 snRNP to the 5' splice site (5'ss) facilitates recognition of the 3'ss by U2 snRNP and also supports formation of vif and vpr mRNA.
   Results: We identified a G run localized deep in the vpr AUG containing intron 3 (G(I3)-2), which was critical for balanced splicing of both vif and vpr non-coding leader exons. Inactivation of G(I3)-2 resulted in excessive exon 3 splicing as well as exon-definition mediated vpr mRNA formation. However, in an apparently mutually exclusive manner this was incompatible with recognition of upstream exon 2 and vif mRNA processing. As a consequence, inactivation of G(I3)-2 led to accumulation of Vpr protein with a concomitant reduction in Vif protein. We further demonstrate that preventing hnRNP binding to intron 3 by G(I3)-2 mutation diminished levels of vif mRNA. In APOBEC3G-expressing but not in APOBEC3G-deficient T cell lines, mutation of G(I3)-2 led to a considerable replication defect. Moreover, in HIV-1 isolates carrying an inactivating mutation in G(I3)-2, we identified an adjacent G-rich sequence (G(I3)-1), which was able to substitute for the inactivated G(I3)-2.
   Conclusions: The functionally conserved intronic G run in HIV-1 intron 3 plays a major role in the apparently mutually exclusive exon selection of vif and vpr leader exons and hence in vif and vpr mRNA formation. The competition between these exons determines the ability to evade APOBEC3G-mediated antiviral effects due to optimal vif expression.

TI Application of quantitative and engineering biology in mRNA gene therapy
SO CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
AB As a transient vector of gene information, messenger RNA (mRNA) is a multifunctional, flexible and safe gene therapy. However, due to the general instability and immunogenicity of mRNA molecules, mRNA gene therapy has not been popularized at first. Over the past few decades, the cross-integration of quantitative and engineering biology has led to a gradual shift from the concept validation phase to the clinical treatment phase. In this paper, we discussed the application of quantitative and engineering biology in mRNA gene therapy from the functional structure of mRNA, design and technical innovation of in vitro synthetic mRNA. Effective engineering approaches will help to establish a precise mRNA gene therapy platform for a variety of indications and genetic backgrounds. Although mRNA therapy is still in the pre-clinical phase in most indications, the accumulation of various engineering and quantitative bio-design methods may broaden the path for next-generation mRNA gene therapy.
   mRNA is an intermediate of genetic information and a template for the biological expression of proteins. Therefore, exogenous mRNA can be introduced into target cells to express the protein of interest. In the early 1970s, Gurdon first verified the above concept in Xenopus oocytes using microinjection. The advantages of mRNA-based gene therapy methods are: First, mRNA therapy has a broader application. mRNA does not need to enter the nucleus to express proteins in the cytoplasm to achieve its function. Therefore, mRNA can be played in cells that divide slowly or do not divide role. Second, mRNA therapy has higher safety, due to its transient expression and the extremely low possibility of genome integration, thereby reducing the two main risks associated with gene therapy (host genome integration and mutations in key regions). Third, the half-life and expression abundance of mRNA synthesized in vitro can be determined by the structure and component design, so that the pharmacokinetics of mRNA drugs can be better controlled. This has created favorable conditions for the pharmaceutical good manufacturing practice (GMP) of mRNA synthetic drugs. In addition, therapeutic proteins synthesized using the natural mechanism of cells have natural post-translational modifications and suitable protein folding effects, which are more advantageous than recombinant proteins synthesized in vitro. In recent years, mRNA, as a therapeutic method, has received increasing attention in the field of gene therapy. Currently, in vitrotranscribed (IVT) mRNA has been used in pre-clinical and clinical trials, including cancer treatment, vaccine development, and protein replacement drug development. Compared with cancer and vaccine treatment, most protein replacement therapies using mRNA are still in preclinical development stage.

TI Moving together with you: Bodily expression of attachment
SO ARTS IN PSYCHOTHERAPY
AB Body movement, also referred to as nonverbal communication is a complex and rich phenomenon. One possible way of systematically organizing the way we interpret nonverbal interpersonal behavior is to link it with one of the most studied and validated constructs of interpersonal relationship: attachment. The preliminary bond be-tween a baby and a caregiver is first and foremost a bodily one, therefore we expect it to be internalized and expressed in the body along the life span. In the present paper, we aim to deepen the understanding of patterns of nonverbal expression by describing several case studies that illustrate in detail each of the attachment classifi-cations and its bodily manifestation in adulthood. We used a simple movement interaction paradigm called the mirror game (MG). The MG is a mimicking task between two participants, taking turns in leading and following each other's movements. We examined the link between the bodily expression during the MG (based on the Mirror-Game Scales) and attachment classifications (based on the Adult Attachment Interview). Based on this link we describe in detail four case studies that demonstrate the use of the MGS. The results present integration of the quantitative and qualitative analysis that enable to demonstrate the synergy between the two methods. To this end, several case studies are described, that illustrate each of the attachment classifications and their bodily manifestations. Individuals with secure classification expressed easiness and flow in their movements, while individuals with insecure classification expressed rigidity and tension. To conclude, the interface between the quantitative analysis and the case studies enabled the translation of the statistical findings into applied infor-mation about individual differences in nonverbal communication, that may have clinical applications.

TI T. S. Eliot in the Art of R. B. Kitaj: Anatomy of an Influence
SO ATLANTIS-JOURNAL OF THE SPANISH ASSOCIATION OF ANGLO-AMERICAN STUDIES
AB R. B. Kitaj's keen interest in literature, which he connected with his Jewish heritage and its reverence for the written word, shows through as an essential characteristic of his art. As a young artist, Kitaj's cultural referents included Ezra Pound and, especially, T. S. Eliot. The external and imaginative structure of The Waste Land (1922) inspired the composition of Kitaj's Tarot Variations (1958), while Eliot's "Notes" to the poem were a model for Kitaj's "prefaces," short texts supplementing many of his paintings. If Not, Not (1975-1976) memorialises the Shoah, also drawing on The Waste Land-the definitive text as well as its drafts and critical reception. Like Eliot's poetry, Kitaj's art is highly allusive, in a way that conforms to Eliot's views on tradition and creativity. This is one of the reasons to stress the continuities with modernism in Kitaj's figurative art, which developed in the predominantly non-figurative context of postmodernism. In later years, Kitaj distanced himself from Eliot-prominently in The Killer Critic (1997)-rejecting the poet's early emphasis on impersonality and the anti-Semitism of his verse. Despite these differences, Eliot's influence on Kitaj was intense, long-lasting and productive.

TI Dinosaurs Become Birds: Changing Cultural Values in Cape Town Theatre
SO THEATRE RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB This article examines a significant change in the hierarchies of value in cultural production in urban Cape Town, where there has been a bifurcation of theatre in the urban centre and on the township periphery. Theatre at these two sites differs in aesthetic character, themes and infrastructural resources, which derive from a history of legislated racial separatism that is still evident today socially, culturally, educationally and in the development of the city itself. Here, I identify changes that have come about in recent years not so much because of the government's policy of redress, but because leading artists are using their pre-eminence and institutions to catalyse educational experiences, performance platforms and a positive marketing environment for theatre and artists from the townships. The Baxter Theatre and its Zabalaza Festival serve as a case study.

TI Integrating close relatives of people experiencing schizophrenia in the
   mental health system
SO ENCEPHALE-REVUE DE PSYCHIATRIE CLINIQUE BIOLOGIQUE ET THERAPEUTIQUE
AB Objectives. - Schizophrenia is a long-term, stigmatized disease which often leads to social impairment, unemployment and isolation, with heavy negative social and psychological consequences both on patients and their families. Close relatives' perceptions of the illness have an impact on their mood, and then on the course of the patient's disease itself. In this context, our objective is to evaluate the perceptions of French close relatives of people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia spectrum disorders, about the disease itself, as well as their experience within the mental healthcare system.
   Methods. - Our population is constituted of close relatives of people experiencing schizophrenia or schizophrenia spectrum disorders, recruited through an active patient and families association. We used a French translation of a standardized questionnaire, the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire, as well as an extensive semi-structured interview assessing the experience of the mental healthcare system (diagnosis divulgation, information about disease and treatment, family psychoeducation, hospitalization experience, and access to health professionals). Some questions in the last were open-ended questions, which allowed us to gather detailed and personal responses, in order to be able to illustrate our quantitative findings with brief clinical cases.
   Results. - Among the 27 close relatives included in our research, results to the standardized questionnaires show threatening perceptions of the disease, in particular regarding the probable duration of the disease and the frequency of symptoms. In our study, a better access to diagnosis is associated with a shorter perceived probable duration of the disease, while an easier communication with healthcare professionals (in particular nurses) is associated with the perception of a better efficiency of the treatment. Family psychoeducation seems to be associated with the perception of less frequent symptoms. When the patient lives independently or is older, close relatives of our sample perceive a higher risk of chronicity of the disease. Our results tend to confirm the available literature on the subject of information towards families in psychiatric services: indeed, studies, especially in the field of nursing research, have shown that families tend to feel excluded from care processes and from useful information exchanges about the patient's illness. Our study also confirms the fact that family psychoeducation seems to reduce the frequency of present symptoms in the patient as perceived by the close relative. This effect could be caused by a better understanding of the real symptoms or by an enhancement of the family mood and functioning. Even if the patient's hospitalization was a difficult or very difficult experience for close relatives, it showed no relationship with their illness negative perceptions. Sociodemographic variables of the patient, such as age or the fact of living in an independent household, were associated in our research with the close relatives' view of a higher potential chronicity of the illness; this could be explained by a different stage of acceptation of the illness when compared to close relatives taking care of a younger or still dependent patient.
   Conclusions. - Our results plead for further research on a larger and less homogeneous sample. Confirming our findings could help build useful recommendations leading to better integrated families who currently seem to feel relatively isolated and exclused in the healthcare process, despite the strategic role they could play and despite the many recommendations of public health policies in that matter. Efforts should continue to be made to reach the goal of a better inclusion of families and close relatives of people experiencing schizophrenia or schizophrenia spectrum disorders, in particular in the field of information and communication with health professionals, both areas which seem to have a potential effect on close relatives' illness negative perceptions. Family psychoeducation deserves more attention and should be more systematically proposed to French families with an easier and free access. (C) 2019 L'Encephale, Paris.

TI NP van Wyk Louw (1906-1970)
SO TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE
AB NP van Wyk Louw is the only Afrikaans writer whose work has been awarded the Hertzog Prize, the most prestigious Afrikaans literary prize, five times. This is an indication of his stature in the Afrikaans cultural community. Karel Schoeman called him South Africa's greatest poet and one of the few world-renowned figures the country has ever produced. The historian Hermann Giliomee believes that Louw 's equal as author ofessays on cultural politics has not been seen in this country yet.
   Nicolaas Petrus van Wyk Louw, born on 11 June 1906, was the second of four sons of Bismarck von Moltke Louw (1874-1949), a lawyer of Sutherland, and Martha Hendrina Johanna Frederika (Poppie) van WA (1882-1970). The youngest son was the poet WEG Louw (1913-1980).
   Their home language and the colloquial language was Afrikaans, but early on Louw became acquainted with English and Dutch. The Dutch Statenbijbel ("State Bible') and the Dutch hymn book were still in use in the church and in households, and his grandfather Lim Ifj/k was able to pray in almost flawless Dutch. Louw later said he remembered that, by analogy of the hymn book, he wrote two lines in very poor Dutch. Even before he was eight years old, Louw felt that what he wanted to do above all was to write poetry.
   English was the language of instruction when Louw started school in 1911. He regularly visited the town library and from his tenth year consulted the Encyclopaedia Britannica. The well-equipped libraty housed only English books, apart from WJ Conradie's Kinderbybel ("Children .'s Bible'). Louw "devoured" history books and literary works.
   In December 1920, the Louw family relocated to Cape Town. Louw attended the South African College School (SAC'S), and after finishing school he enrolled at the University of Cape Town, majoring in Latin, German, Dutch and Afrikaans. Next, he completed a master's degree in German and, after teaching for a year in the small Eastern Cape village of Steynsburg, completed a BEd degree. In 1930, Louw was appointed as a lecturer in the bilingual Faculty of Education at UCT, and in the same year he married Joan Wessels (1906-1975).
   By 1930 some of Louw 's poems had been published in the Kwartaalblad, but his first manuscript for a volume of poetry had been rejectedfbr publication by a literary critic. This criticism was such a blow to Louw 's confidence that he temporarily stopped writing poetry. When his youngest brother, Gladstone, set eyes on those poems, he realised their value. After four years, Louw started to write again. His debut poetry collection, Alleenspraak ("Monologue"), was published in 1935.
   Even before the publication of Alleenspraak, Louw, as a public intellectual, started to write more and more about matters affecting Afrikaans and the Afrikaner. From 1935, he started writing about Afrikaans authors and their national aspiration. For Louw, politics was an essential aspect of the language struggle, but for a national movement by the people it was, in his view, merely a technical means to achieve a set goal. Without the creation of a meaningful literature, the language movement and the accompanying political movement would have made no sense. His articles were collected in the volumes Berigte to velde ("Reportsfrom the field") and Lojale verset ("Loyal resistance') in 1939. The latter includes the well-known slogan that revolt is as essential to a nation as loyalty. It is not really dangerous when a rebellion fails; what is dangerous is that an entire generation might pass without protest. These two volumes had a major influence on the intellectual life of Afrikaners.
   Some of Louw's major nationalistic poems were included in his second anthology, Die halwe kring ("The half-circle"; 1937), and in his choral drama Die dieper reg ("The deeper right"; 1938), which has a nation's right to continued existence as theme. The Dutch-born HA Mulder was of the opinion that the volume Die halwe kring ranks with the major Dutch lyrical collections of poems as their equal. It was awarded the Hertzog Prize. His following works, Raka (1941) and Gestaltes en diem ("Figures and animals"; 1942), were received very well and are regarded as high points of Afrikaans poetry. Literary critics such as AP Grove highlight the spectacular development of Louws poetry since Alleenspraak. In the 1940s, he started writing his verse drama Gennanicus as well (1956; in 1960 it was awarded the Hertzog Prize) and later he also wrote several radio dramas. Since 1937, Truida Pohl had been an inspiration in his life. They were married in 1941 after his divorce from his first wife. Two children were born of this marriage: Reinet (1946) and Peter (1950).
   During the 1940s, Louw wrote numerous literary articles; he and Truida worked for Afrikaans radio, and, together with his brother Gladstone, they founded the literary journal Standpunte ("Points of view "), in which he also published articles. Although he later became an outspoken critic ofapartheid, in 1946 he pointed out the powerlessness into which Afrikaners and English speakers would sink and the danger of cultural suicide that could result if liberal principles were introduced unqualifiedly in South Africa.
   In 1948, the Rijksuniversiteit of Utrecht awarded him an honorary doctorate to acknowledge the interest in and great appreciation of the Dutch humanities for the developments in the latest Afrikaans literature, of which, the commendation read, he was the leader and symbol.
   In 1949, Louw accepted an appointment as professor in "Zuidafrikaanse taal- en letterkunde" (South African language and literature) at the Gemeentelijke Universiteit of Amsterdam. His wife and children could not leave with him, and while on his own in Amsterdam a love affair developed between him and the poet Sheila Cussons. This relationship was not always close, but for Louw it was a creative stimulus. Without Sheila Cussons many of the poems in Nuwe verse ("New poems"; 1954) and Tristia (1962) would never have been written.
   During his years in Amsterdam, he also wrote the series "Die oop gesprek" ("The open conversation"), which appeared in the popular weekly Die Huisgenoot from 20 July 1951 until 18 December 1953. Many of the essays in that magazine dealt with literary themes, the most influential of which being the series "Die Inens' agter die boek" ("The 'person 'behind the book'). They were aimed at psychologism in literary views and criticism.
   In "Kultuur en krisis" ("Culture and crisis"), he explains the crises that can befall a nation. The first is that of physical annihilation; the second, the crisis of despair. This latter crisis occurs when many members of a community feel that it is not worthwhile to continue as a group with its own language. Finally there is an ethical crisis, which entails the belief that mere survival is preferable to survival in justice.
   The articles in Die Huisgenoot and other essays were published in 1955 under the title Maskers van die ems ("Masks of earnestness') and in 1958 in three further volumes: Swaarteen ligpunte ("Centres of gravity and luminosity'), 'n Wereld deur glas ("A world through glass) and Liberale nasionalisme ("Liberal nationalism'). The first-mentioned and Die mens agter die boek (1956) formed part of the collection of critical prose and essays that earned him the Hertzog prize in 1958.
   Louw received this news in June 1958, shortly before he departed for South Africa to take up the position of head of the Department of Afrikaans and Dutch at the University of the Witwatersrand.
   In 1962, Tristia was published This title refers to a volume by the Roman poet Ovid, written during his exile. Gerrit Olivier points out what he called the unbelievably complex richness of Louws Tristia According to Grove, Tristia contains some of the most mature and profound poems in Afrikaans. His inaugural address at Wits, "Oor moeilike literatuur: die 'verwysingsmoeilikheid- ("On difficult literature: the problem of reference') in 1959 is virtually a theoretical guide to Tristia The volume was awarded the Hertzog prize for poetry in 1965. In his address of commendation at the award ceremony, TT Cloete stated that with Tristia Louw 's mastery as poet, which again and again proved to be surprising, once again took a new direction. He added that Louw remained, together with much younger poets, one of the "youngest" poets in the country.
   Cloete referred to the work of the new literary generation: the authors of the 1960s ("die Sestigers"). Louw went to great lengths to combat misconceptions about prose and innovation. His articles are contained in Vernuwing in die prosa ("Renewal in our prose"; 1961). Etienne Leroux stated that Louw s treatment of his first books was an incentive for him to continue his writing.
   In 1965, Louw stepped into the breach for another poet of the 1960s, Breyten Breytenbach. The government had refused a visa for Breyten's wife, Yolande, to visit South Africa because she was born Vietnamese. In a letter to a newspaper Louw criticised the government "as an Afrikaner", but also on behalf of the Afrikaans literature, which, he said, had its own honour and dignity. He was pained and ashamed because the Afrikaans nationalism in which he grew up and in which he hoped to die was, for him, the greatest movement in our history and a sign of growth, of an increasingly full life. Had this, he asked, turned into a petrified ideology that officials could measure with a carpenter's rule?
   Louw wrote various pieces for special occasions. The most controversial was Die pluimsaad waai ver ("The plume seeds are blown far'), which was performed during the Republic Festival in 1966. It starts with the question of what a nation is. In Pluimsaad all those who in the Anglo-Boer War participated on the side of the Free State belonged to the Free State Afrikaners. They included, apart from the Afrikaners, also English speakers, Cape rebels, Dutchmen and coloured people. The literary critic Merwe Scholtz regarded the drama as a "broad democratic definition of the Afrikaner nation". The performance elicited much criticism in 1966 in a Republic Festival speech from the Prime Minister, Dr HF Verwoerd, as well. Most of the letters to newspapers were pro-Louw, however, and some important personages came to his defence.
   On 13 November 1961, Louw had a serious heart attack and from then on suffered heart trouble. Early on the morning of 18 June 1970 he died a week after his 64th birthday and three weeks after the death of his eldest brother, Koos, to whom he was very close. Their mother, the 88-year-old Poppie, who was bedridden after a stroke, died on 28 July.
   Louw remains relevant in the literary and cultural lift of South Africa. His works remain alive in intertextual references, citations, parodies and titles, for instance in the works of Breyten Breytenbach, Sheila Cussons, Johan van Wyk and Joan Hambidge.
   After 1970, "Kultuur en krisis" was a theme in the political debate. Giliomee writes that Louw's phrases regarding continued existence in justice and loyal resistance were freely used in the public debate during the 1970s in his opinion often opportunistically. Breyten Breytenbach quoted the former phrase during his trial in 1975. Even before Breytenbach came to South Africa to establish a structure for an underground movement, certain ANC leaders informed the security police. He was arrested, and during his trial he invoked Louw in a desperate plea: "It may be paradoxical, but for me the very point was the survival of our people, survival in justice as Van Wyk Louw put it, it was about the quality and content of our civilization" [own translation]. The judge did not take any note of this.
   Afrikaners nowadays find themselves amidst the second kind of crisis that Louw distinguished: the crisis of despair, despair which is the result of emigration and Anglicisation, of the ideology of "transformation" and of the disregard for language rights by antagonistic authorities. In the discourse about this situation, Louw views on such a crisis and on the response of people of culture to that crisis gain new significance and relevancy.

TI Y-Box Binding Protein 1 Stabilizes Hepatitis C Virus NS5A via
   Phosphorylation-Mediated Interaction with NS5A To Regulate Viral
   Propagation
SO JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
AB Replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is dependent on virus-encoded proteins and numerous cellular factors. DDX3 is a well-known host cofactor of HCV replication. In this study, we investigated the role of a DDX3-interacting protein, Y-box binding protein 1 (YB-1), in the HCV life cycle. Both YB-1 and DDX3 interacted with the viral nonstructural protein NS5A. During HCV infection, YB-1 partially colocalized with NS5A and the HCV replication intermediate double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in HCV-infected Huh-7.5.1 cells. Despite sharing the same interacting partners, YB-1 participated in HCV RNA replication but was dispensable in steady-state HCV RNA replication, different from the action of DDX3. Moreover, knockdown of YB-1 in HCV-infected cells prevented infectious virus production and reduced the ratio of hyperphosphorylated (p58) to hypophosphorylated (p56) forms of NS5A, whereas DDX3 silencing did not affect the ratio of the p58 and p56 phosphoforms of NS5A. Interestingly, silencing of YB-1 severely reduced NS5A protein stability in NS5A-ectopically expressing, replicon-containing, and HCV-infected cells. Furthermore, mutations of serine 102 of YB-1 affected both YB-1-NS5A interaction and NS5A-stabilizing activity of YB-1, indicating that this Akt phosphorylation site of YB-1 plays an important role in stabilizing NS5A. Collectively, our results support a model in which the event of YB-1 phosphorylation-mediated interaction with NS5A results in stabilizing NS5A to sustain HCV RNA replication and infectious HCV production. Overall, our study may reveal a new aspect for the development of novel anti-HCV drugs.
   IMPORTANCE
   Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection induces liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The viral nonstructural protein NS5A co-opting various cellular signaling pathways and cofactors to support viral genome replication and virion assembly is a new strategy for anti-HCV drug development. NS5A phosphorylation is believed to modulate switches between different stages of the HCV life cycle. In this study, we identified the cellular protein YB-1 as a novel NS5A-interacting protein. YB-1 is a multifunctional protein participating in oncogenesis and is an oncomarker of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We found that YB-1 protects NS5A from degradation and likely regulates NS5A phosphorylation through its phosphorylation-dependent interaction with NS5A, which might be controlled by HCV-induced signaling pathways. Our observations suggest a model in which HCV modulates NS5A level and the ratio of the p58 and p56 phosphoforms for efficient viral propagation via regulation of cellular signaling inducing YB-1 phosphorylation. Our finding may provide new aspects for developing novel anti-HCV drugs.

TI Radiolabeled Bombesin Analogs
SO CANCERS
AB Simple Summary:& nbsp;Recent medical advancements have strived for a personalized medicine approach to patients, aimed at optimizing therapy outcomes with minimum toxicity. In this respect, nuclear medicine methodologies have been playing increasingly important roles. For example, the overexpression of peptide receptors, such as the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR), on tumor cells as opposed to their lack of expression in healthy surrounding tissues can be elegantly exploited with the aid of "smart " peptide carriers, such as the analogs of the amphibian 14-peptide bombesin (BBN). These molecules can bring clinically attractive radionuclides to malignant lesions in prostate, breast, and other human cancers, sparing healthy tissues. Depending upon the radionuclide in question, diagnostic imaging with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) has been pursued, identifying patients who are eligible for peptide radionuclide receptor therapy (PRRT) in an integrated "theranostic " approach. In the present review, we (i) discuss the major steps taken in the development of anti-GRPR theranostic radioligands, with a focus on those selected for clinical testing; (ii) comment on the present status in this field of research; and (iii) reflect on the current limitations as well as on new opportunities for their broader and more successful clinical applications.& nbsp;The gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) is expressed in high numbers in a variety of human tumors, including the frequently occurring prostate and breast cancers, and therefore provides the rationale for directing diagnostic or therapeutic radionuclides on cancer lesions after administration of anti-GRPR peptide analogs. This concept has been initially explored with analogs of the frog 14-peptide bombesin, suitably modified at the N-terminus with a number of radiometal chelates. Radiotracers that were selected for clinical testing revealed inherent problems associated with these GRPR agonists, related to low metabolic stability, unfavorable abdominal accumulation, and adverse effects. A shift toward GRPR antagonists soon followed, with safer analogs becoming available, whereby, metabolic stability and background clearance issues were gradually improved. Clinical testing of three main major antagonist types led to promising outcomes, but at the same time brought to light several limitations of this concept, partly related to the variation of GRPR expression levels across cancer types, stages, previous treatments, and other factors. Currently, these parameters are being rigorously addressed by cell biologists, chemists, nuclear medicine physicians, and other discipline practitioners in a common effort to make available more effective and safe state-of-the-art molecular tools to combat GRPR-positive tumors. In the present review, we present the background, current status, and future perspectives of this endeavor.

TI EVOLUTION OF THE USES OF GORSE IN NATIVE AND INVADED REGIONS: WHAT ARE
   THE IMPACTS ON ITS DYNAMICS AND MANAGEMENT?
SO REVUE D ECOLOGIE-LA TERRE ET LA VIE
AB The introduction and geographic expansion of invasive species, as well as their possible decline, often follow processes in which humans play a central role. This is the case for gorse (Ulex europaeus), which was intentionally introduced into more than 30 countries and is considered as one of the "100 of the world's worst invasive species" by the IUCN. Within its native range (Western Europe), it is very widespread in Great Britain, Brittany and Galicia, but it is not seen as a problem there as it is routinely and effectively managed. Gorse has long been used for agricultural purposes, and management practices have been developed in parallel to these uses. However, these practices and uses have not always been transferred to the introduced regions. The aim of our study was to investigate the changes in the use of gorse, as well as the traditional and contemporary management practices in its native and invaded ranges; partly to trace the history and motivations behind its introduction around the world, and partly to propose innovative and sustainable management practices. We retraced the history of the uses and perceptions of this plant in its native and invaded ranges by focusing on one native region (Brittany) and one invaded region (Reunion Island). Historical and contemporary data were collected using bibliographic and document searches as well as survey interviews. Thus, we were able to retrace the wide range of agricultural uses of gorse, the motivations behind its introduction into the European colonial empire, the gradual decline of these uses, and modem control techniques. We also show that the traditional uses of the plant and its virtues are still well-known in the native range: farmers are showing an interest in reemploying it for its fodder qualities, and institutional and industrial partners are interested in making use of it as a marketable resource (fuel, fodder and fertilizer). We also looked at tests for innovative management tools, in both natural and agricultural regions. These works suggest possible innovations, but also their limitations, for the invaded regions.

TI Identification of Selective Novel Hits against Plasmodium falciparum
   Prolyl tRNA Synthetase Active Site and a Predicted Allosteric Site Using
   In Silico Approaches
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB Recently, there has been increased interest in aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) as potential malarial drug targets. These enzymes play a key role in protein translation by the addition of amino acids to their cognate tRNA. The aaRSs are present in all Plasmodium life cycle stages, and thus present an attractive malarial drug target. Prolyl tRNA synthetase is a class II aaRS that functions in charging tRNA with proline. Various inhibitors against Plasmodium falciparum ProRS (PfProRS) active site have been designed. However, none have gone through clinical trials as they have been found to be highly toxic to human cells. Recently, a possible allosteric site was reported in PfProRS with two possible allosteric modulators: glyburide and TCMDC-124506. In this study, we sought to identify novel selective inhibitors targeting PfProRS active site and possible novel allosteric modulators of this enzyme. To achieve this, virtual screening of South African natural compounds against PfProRS and the human homologue was carried out using AutoDock Vina. The modulation of protein motions by ligand binding was studied by molecular dynamics (MD) using the GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulations (GROMACS) tool. To further analyse the protein global motions and energetic changes upon ligand binding, principal component analysis (PCA), and free energy landscape (FEL) calculations were performed. Further, to understand the effect of ligand binding on the protein communication, dynamic residue network (DRN) analysis of the MD trajectories was carried out using the MD-TASK tool. A total of ten potential natural hit compounds were identified with strong binding energy scores. Binding of ligands to the protein caused observable global and residue level changes. Dynamic residue network calculations showed increase in betweenness centrality (BC) metric of residues at the allosteric site implying these residues are important in protein communication. A loop region at the catalytic domain between residues 300 and 350 and the anticodon binding domain showed significant contributions to both PC1 and PC2. Large motions were observed at a loop in the Z-domain between residues 697 and 710 which was also in agreement with RMSF calculations that showed increase in flexibility of residues in this region. Residues in this loop region are implicated in ATP binding and thus a change in dynamics may affect ATP binding affinity. Free energy landscape (FEL) calculations showed that the holo protein (protein-ADN complex) and PfProRS-SANC184 complexes were stable, as shown by the low energy with very few intermediates and hardly distinguishable low energy barriers. In addition, FEL results agreed with backbone RMSD distribution plots where stable complexes showed a normal RMSD distribution while unstable complexes had multimodal RMSD distribution. The betweenness centrality metric showed a loss of functional importance of key ATP binding site residues upon allosteric ligand binding. The deep basins in average L observed at the allosteric region imply that there is high accessibility of residues at this region. To further analyse BC and average L metrics data, we calculated the Delta BC and Delta L values by taking each value in the holo protein BC or L matrix less the corresponding value in the ligand-bound complex BC or L matrix. Interestingly, in allosteric complexes, residues located in a loop region implicated in ATP binding had negative Delta L values while in orthosteric complexes these residues had positive Delta L values.
   An increase in contact frequency between residues Ser263, Thr267, Tyr285, and Leu707 at the allosteric site and residues Thr397, Pro398, Thr402, and Gln395 at the ATP binding TXE loop was observed. In summary, this study identified five potential orthosteric inhibitors and five allosteric modulators against PfProRS. Allosteric modulators changed ATP binding site dynamics, as shown by RMSF, PCA, and DRN calculations. Changes in dynamics of the ATP binding site and increased contact frequency between residues at the proposed allosteric site and the ATP binding site may explain how allosteric modulators distort the ATP binding site and thus might inhibit PfProRS. The scaffolds of the identified hits in the study can be used as a starting point for antimalarial inhibitor development with low human cytotoxicity.

TI Fixed abodes: Urban emplacement, bureaucratic requirements, and the
   politics of belonging among West African migrants in Paris
SO AMERICAN ETHNOLOGIST
AB Foyers, housing facilities for male migrants, are well-known institutions of postcolonial France and critical nodes in West African migratory networks. A nationwide plan to renovate the foyers presents distinct challenges to the arrangements established by the generations of migrants who live in them, arrangements that have long sustained the social reproduction of transnational migration. In response, residents foreground their long-established presence in Paris to stake claims in the renovation process. Their stories of urban dwelling are punctuated by postal addresses, bureaucratic tokens of identification that play a pivotal role both in migrants' historical imagination and in the administrative modes of granting residency rights. The foyers are sites of emplacement, albeit fragile, and spaces from which West African migrants contest their political exclusion in present-day France.

TI THE ROLE OF PERSIAN LANGUAGE IN CULTURE AND HISTORY AND ITS SERVICES IN
   PROPHETIC TRADITION (HADITH)
SO BILIMNAME
AB Civilization is a social phenomenon which has been transferred from generation to generation and aims to clarify the truths, protect a certain society and aimes the civilized life style and the relationship dimension of society with human being.
   Islam is a universal religion. The Islamic conquests have been caused the expansion of the Islamic realm for the servitude the of Allah and to achieve peace in the world. For this supreme purpose islamic invitation started from Arabian peninsula to the four corners of the World.
   Language and culture have their effect on everywhere and no matter who they are. For this reason, by the emergence and conquests of Islam, Arabic language has effected other languages as well as Persian language. Similarly, we witness that Arabic language has also been effected by the Persian language. Namely; The role of Persians and Persian speakers in carrying the burden of the Dawa; They undertook the stage from teaching to giving works and classifying in the Arabic language together with the Arabs. The Arabic language is the language of a heavenly religion, and it deserves to have a place with great care among Muslims. We never forget that the Arabic language is an occasion to understand religion and the purposes of religion. Since Arabic language is and the manifestation of belief and religiousness, so what reason can be for this language to not be that much effective? Because of this, people took care of learning Arabic and taking care of it.
   As we have significant evidence, the purpose of the preparation of this article is to shed light on revealing the force limit of interaction and revealing the influence of the Arabic language on Persian and vice versa. It is also to shed light on the centuries of social and cultural relationship, and especially the depth of this relationship between the owners of both Persian and Arabic-speaking languages throughout Islamic history. This relationship also sheds light on the Quran the language of religion, sunnah (tradation), and other knoledge in the Islamic world, caused a reaction in the Persians other than the Arabs in accepting the Arabic language.
   Based on this research, we have touched on the diligent work of Persians and Persian language speakers that they really made a big contribution by the using of many styles for copyrighting, work, and translation. In particular, it is appropriate to mention their copywrighting, monument writing, and explaination of sunnah and hadith in persian language. Role of the Persian language and the works of Persian scholars, writers and scientists on hadith or sunnah are valuable. In fact, the mention of this issue is the reflection of the effects of the wings against the historical dual. Although Arabic is the religion' rich language, it is not the only language. Maybe Persian also continued as the living language of the environment with Arabic. Because Persian with its deepseated and strong history preserved itself throughout history. In Arabic and Persian, especially in the Islamic period, it is observed that the wealth of Arabic has increased with the transfer of words from Arabic to Persian beyond the ground of both language and cultural interaction. The Persian language is based on rich productive resource works in scientific fields. By comming of the process that started from the period of the Prophet (PBUH) to the Abbasid period, the influence of Persian culture is understood more effectively and clearly. Then it continued in that sense during the Seljuk empire period. As the heir of the Seljuk empire the Ottoman caliphet, we have been witnessing in the libraries the datas produced in the literary and poetry world in an effective way. Although Persian is one of the three indispensable languages in the Ottoman state, later on, during the 16th century translation movement, especially Mevlana' Mesnevi increased the interest. Indeed, Persian is defined as the transmitter of the second Islamic education and cultural existence of the Far East, Turkish lands and India. The Turkish state has included Persian as the official language wherever it was founded. The number of academic works in persian language in the field of knowledge of Hadith is interesting. The Persian works written in the soil of India in the recent period have a significant and academic role. The conquerors of India interpreted and translated the hadith knowledge in Arabic and Persian languages in the 10th and 11th centuries during the Ghaznavids period. By the 12th century, Persian has become more common.
   In the period of Babur Temuri, Persian became the official language of the state. According to historical informations, while Turkish was the language of heads of state, Persian was known as the official language of the state and Arabic was the language of religion. It is also important to introduce Persian hadith works written in this period and after. Contemporary Persian hadith studies are rapidly on the agenda, whether at universities or on sites. We briefly informed about them. No wonder most of the writers of sunnah and language resources in the classical period were persians. This is exactly what the Prophet was talking about by putting his hand on the shoulder of Salman Farsi ans said: "Soon that will come out of these people that even if iman be in surayya star they will catch up it."
   Likewise, the role of education on this subject is the perfection, the maturity of the invitation to Islam, and the reaching of the Arabic language and manners all over the Islamic world. Undoubtedly, Persian played a significant role in the transfer of Islamic culture on the eastern front. academic assets in Turkish lands and in the India geography are especially valuable. In summary, let us add that cultural and academic assets in Persian language constitute a large scale and basic structure in the Ottoman Empire. Therefore, it is the debt of those who pay attention to history for their transfer, which is to reflect the necessary focuses to our current life for educational and cultural purposes. It is very important for everyone to contribute to these scientific heritages within the framework of the possibilities.
   In the presentation of this article; we will try to use reliable texts, qualitative and analytical methods, and methods that enable this issue to be criticized from different directions.

SO PLOS ONE
AB The present study introduces the German version of the original version of the Music@Home questionnaire developed in the UK, which systematically evaluates musical engagement in the home environment of young children. Two versions are available, an Infant version for children aged three to 23 months and a Preschool version for children aged two to five and a half years. For the present study, the original Music@Home questionnaire was translated from English into German and 656 caregivers completed the questionnaire online. A confirmatory factor analysis showed moderate to high fit indices for both versions, confirming the factor structure of the original questionnaire. Also, the reliability coefficients for the subscales (Parental beliefs, Child engagement with music, Parent initiation of singing, Parent initiation of music-making for the Infant version and Parental beliefs, Child engagement with music, Parent initiation of music behavior and Breadth of musical exposure for the Preschool version) ranged from moderate to high fits. Furthermore, the test-retest analysis (N= 392) revealed high correlations for the general factor and all subscales confirming their internal reliability. Additionally, we included language questionnaires for children of two and three years of age. Results showed that higher scores on the Music@Home questionnaire were moderately associated with better language skills in two-year-olds (N= 118). In sum, the study presents the validated German Music@Home questionnaire, which shows good psychometric properties. The two versions of the questionnaire are available for use in order to assess home musical engagement of young children, which could be of interest in many areas of developmental research.

TI DISASTER SCENARIOS IN KATHRIN ROGGLA'S DIE ALARMBEREITEN
SO FOLIA LINGUISTICA ET LITTERARIA
AB The paper delves into how Kathrin Roggla, an Austrian author, approaches the problem of tackling the topic of catastrophe in her book die alarmbereiten published in 2010. Roggla, nowadays considered one of the most socially committed and engage authors in Germany's contemporary literature domain, deals relentlessly with such issues as crisis, catastrophe, alarmism and fear in modern-day society. The media occupies one of the most pivotal roles in this process.
   Hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, extreme cold, unbearable heat and attendant fires, volcanic eruptions are just some of the natural disasters the world endured during the preceding year and all of which was easily accessible and covered in detail in print and electronic media. We should not forget the political crises, for instance the one in Afghanistan or the migrant crisis on the border between Belarus and the European Union. The conflict concerning Ukraine and the economic crisis regarding the blockade of the Suez Canal, just to mention a few. Based on of these examples, it is clear that the themes of crisis and catastrophe are permanently present in modern life. On a global scale, the world has been grappling with a dire crisis, for almost two years now - the coronavirus pandemic. It is easy to see how the world has changed and quite significantly over the course of the ongoing pandemic. It is also celar that all these phenomena lead to consequences in the lives of all of us. The state of emergency has actually become a normal state.
   Austrian author Kathrin Roggla writes about many of these topics in her book die alarmbereiten. In the seven chapters, she constantly re-enacts settings and circumstances in which a person must be readily prepared for a new crisis or catastrophe. The media have a special role in this discourse, portraying the crisis in such a way so as to reaffirm that in today's world and society, humankind can no longer feel safe and has a persistent feeling that life and existence are permanently threatened. In addition to literary works, the author deals with the issue of catastrophe and crisis in many poetic texts, essays and interviews. The author, born in 1971 in Salzburg, has lived and worked in Berlin since 1992. She has won numerous awards, including the Bruno Kreisky Award for Political Book (2004), and the New York-Stipendium des Deutschen Literaturfonds, which seems to have had a particularly meaningful impact on the author's choice to write about crisis, disaster and the media. Owing to aforementioned award, Roggla accidentally happened to be in New York on September 11, 2001, just a few blocks from the attack. In numerous articles, she underscores that she was fascinated by catastrophes even before that event, but that her personal presence at the events in New York influenced her in the sense that the state of emergency after the attack was most interesting for her because she wanted to see how American society, the media, politicians and civil society would react to the catastrophe, and how they dealt with this new reality since in fact their reaction to the what had occurred is a story about their society. The author often points out that she actually writes about our everyday life and how that everyday life is increasingly determined by the "grammar of catastrophe". It is precisely this "grammar of catastrophe" that interests her most. The language she incorporates plays a very important role in her works. Roggla believes that in modern times, citizens no longer feel like citizens, but like figures who helplessly observe events: either as spectators or as victims. In such situations, a person feels insignificant and too small to do anything on their own. She insists on writing all her works in lower case, in the conjunctive and in indirect speech: the self-narrator no longer appears as someone who speaks directly, but others speak on their behalf.
   The book die alarmbereiten is a remake of the play worst case performed in 2008. And the chapter wilde jagd is based on the play die beteiligten. Before the text was published in the form of a book, the author presented the text to the public as a radio play of the same name, which was chosen as the radio drama of the month in August 2009.
   The aim of this article is to analyze the first three chapters of this book in terms of content and narrative theory. This is interesting first and foremost because there is no traditional narrator in the text. The traditional understanding of the instance narrated about is framed in indirect speech and recalibrated. It is differently made evident what someone said about someone else at the time of a given situation. It is often reported from the I-perspective in the conjunction with what others have said about the I-figure. At the same time, the I-figure is often criticized, objections are made at the expense of, but the I-figure per se never speaks. From the aspect of theory, this is a very interesting technique employed by the author. Regarding this technique, she herself said that there is one constant in the book, namely the I that narrates. It is constituted viewpoint of others: it is often demonized, ignored and condemned. It can be surmised that the figures in this book are not classic and they have no personal identity since they do not speak for themselves. The title itself suggests that this is a group of people who are always ready to react in various crisis / alarming situations and who are always ready to wait for the next disaster. Alarmed people who constantly reckon with the worst.
   Roggla opens the book, and at the same time the first chapter die zuseher with sentences that associate the reader with prospective impending catastrophes such as fires, floods, stormy winds, and so forth. This text is in italics and resembles instructions for actors in theater performances; it is preceded by a drawing by Oliver Grajewski. The drawing can be associated with both the title of this chapter and the opening sentences. An unspecified narrative instance alludes to the possible or real impending catastrophes. That voice sounds prophetic and terrifies the reader. The initial formulation, which is repeated over and over again, may correspond to the title of the chapter through the position of perception, but these anticipations of future catastrophes can also refer to the content of other chapters of the book.
   In the third section, this indefinite and undefined position changes and the view and focuses on the recipients who observe certain events. They are present for them, but they are not affected by the events, and therefore they do not understand them and feel bored. But the question is: Is that really the case?
   After these lines, the picture changes completely and the reader is confronted with the protocols of the four sessions. The events are set in a hotel in Los Angeles, where a group of business representatives is conducting an exercise to simulate behavior in the event of an impending disaster. From the first protocol, it appears that the planned leader of the group has disappeared, and together with him, the protocol. From the following pages we learn that the leadership of the group is taken over by another person, while it remains unclear whether the designated leader disappeared because he did not follow the rules or his disappearance is the first task that the group needs to successfully overcome. The group aims to devise certain strategies on how to best respond to a disaster by observing parking in front of a shopping mall and the behavior of people in the event of a disaster. Since the new group leader is not trained for the job, he uses familiar patterns from movies and stories to try to organize the group and motivate it to take an active part in the situation. But nothing happens in the parking lot of the shopping center, the group gets bored and one by one the participants leave the sessions, while it also remains unclear whether the disappearance of some members of the group is a predetermined scenario or happens because individuals do not cooperate. It is interesting that the participants in the exercise are completely focused on the events they are observing, that is. They are fully focused on the future. They completely miss the fact that they themselves are part of the scenario that is happening in the present, that is. That someone observes them and their reactions. This is unambiguously demonstrated in Oliver Grajewski's illustration where one female person sits or lies watching the multitude of screens in front of her on which something is happening. In the end, the leader of the group is left alone with the protocol officer and cannot believe that this is the end of the exercise. In such an outcome, he is the only one to whom something tragic is happening, which we learn from the words of the protocol officer, who reports that after the protocol is over, he must seek help, although it is against certain rules of the agency.
   This scenario is undeniably reminiscent of present-day reality shows possibly a critical note of Roggla's text. Also, he confirms the author's words that today we are all either observers or victims of events, and not active participants. I is equally clear that the scenarios of narratives about catastrophes are so ingrained in the consciousness of modern man that in anticipation of such spectacular scenarios we are unable to recognize a catastrophe that unfolds before our very eyes.
   This chapter is written in the form of the minutes of four sessions of the group and it alternately uses the technique of direct and indirect speech, with indirect speech in the conjunctiva predominating. The chapter, according to the nature of the protocol, is written on-form and directly or indirectly conveys the voices of the exercise participants, mostly the group leader. But his words are often given in indirect speech in the conjunctiva, which is a means of distancing oneself from the events themselves, but also from the words spoken. The votes, therefore, belong to the participants in the seminar, but it is not clear which narrative instance transmits their votes, that is. Who narrates?
   The second chapter die ansprechbare is about a night phone conversation. Two female figures appear. In the text, we learn that the two of them are friends and that this is just one of the many phone conversations they have. The first female figure is marked as a self-narrator, from which it could be concluded that the situation is presented from her perspective. But she does not narrate in her own name, that is. Her words are not transmitted directly, but are given from the perspective of her telephone interlocutor. As a selfnarrator, she makes a series of apocalyptic predictions about natural disasters that threaten in the near future or have already begun, and are caused by climate change. Among other things, water and fire are themed, and that will prove to be an anticipation of future events. This female figure bases her panic fears on the statements of experts, ie. He transfers them from the second hand, and Roggla draws attention to the events in modern society, where we find many self-proclaimed and self-proclaimed experts, by thematizing this "secondary expert knowledge". The importance of this topic to the author is evidenced by the fact that the issue of this secondary expert knowledge is dealt with in other chapters of this book. The self-narrator of this second chapter is in a constant state of emergency, while her interlocutor tries to alleviate her fears and predictions. In the continuation, this self-figure is named as Cassandra, and the mention of the famous prophetess from antiquity who predicted the apocalyptic events that will really follow, and which no one believed, has a certain role in predicting the tragic end of the interlocutor. In an effort to relativize the fears of the narrative self, she does not react at the right time and in the right way to the real danger - fire - and dies due to inadequate treatment in a state of real catastrophe.
   Consistent lowercase writing and the use of conjunctives also characterize this chapter. The issue of narrative instance is very complex in this part of the text. Although it is stated that this is a telephone conversation between two friends, the word "conversation" can hardly be used to describe what is being told in the text. It is actually a report of a telephone conversation. What is very unusual is that the narrative self does not speak in its own name anywhere, but the words of that narrative self are given from the perspective of the telephone interlocutor, who conveys the recapitulated words of the narrative self from all perspectives, giving them a certain emotional note.
   The third chapter der ubersetzer deals with the issue of translation, focusing on the issue of the economic crisis. An unnamed translator has the task of referring an unnamed interlocutor to a professional economic or business vocabulary. Although the main protagonist of the chapter is a translator, he does not speak for himself anywhere in the text, but his words are conveyed in the form of a monologue by his "student".
   What all three chapters of the book have in common is that each of them deals with a different problem: potential natural disasters that do not occur, death due to fire or panic fear caused by climate change, and the great economic crisis. All these topics, as well as a number of others, which are discussed in other chapters, are anticipated by the prophetic words from the beginning of the first chapter. From the aspect of the way of narration in the analyzed chapters, consistent writing in lower case is noticeable, the use of conjunctives, narrative self, but narrative self which never narrates in its own name, i.e., it is never directly announced, but his words are transposed through someone else's perspective, or through the perspective of a friend or through the perspective of a student. Also, a different media aspect was applied in all three chapters: in the first they were sessions, in the second a telephone conversation, and in the third a seminar / class. What all the figures have in common is that they are not typical figures, they do not have any personal identity, but are actually voices that indicate certain problems in society. A small number of voices appear, usually two, so the author simulates a speech situation, which is actually absent because that speech situation is reduced to a monologue of one of the voices. The texts are also characterized by the disappearance of figures, which is noticeable in all three texts. Together with all the analyzed chapters, a tragic end was realized or hinted at, in the second explicitly a fatal outcome. In all three scenarios, the figures are both / or observers and / or victims, as the author pointed out in her poetic texts. In this way, it points to the image of the society in which we live.

AB Background: Social isolation, loneliness and anxiety-depressive states are emerging health conditions in the elderly. Research question: To assess whether a 4-month programme of physical activity in a group improves the emotional, social and quality of life situation in a sample of subjects over 64 years old people. Methods: Multi-centre randomized clinical trial of two groups. Study population: Patients older than 64 years assigned to three primary care teams from different locations. Inclusion criteria: Submit a score <32 on the DUKE-UNC-11 social support scale, or >12 on the Beck Depression Scale, or >10 on the Generalized Anxiety Scale (GAD-7), at the start of the study. The intervention group participated in a group physical activity program for 4-months that consisted of progressively walking sessions two days a week, 60-150 minutes long depending on the physical condition of each participant. Results: Enrolled were 94 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Mean age was 74 years (SD 5.18) and 76.6% were women. No significant differences were found at the beginning of the study between the two groups in relation to the outcome of the scales evaluated. Once the intervention was completed, improvement in the quality of life and social support was detected in the intervention group (p<.05). Both groups improved the depression and anxiety clinic but the improvement in the participants of the intervention group was higher. Those with initial depression improved 8.6 points on the scale, compared to the control that improved 3.3 points, with the final average of 17.4. Those who presented initial anxiety improved 8 points (final average: 7.5 points, cut-off point for the diagnosis of anxiety 10), compared to the control that improved 5.1 points. Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that the program developed has positive effects on improving the quality of life, social support and depression and anxiety clinic.
   Background: Tourism represents 45% gross domestic product in Balearic Islands. Working as a hotel housekeeper (HH) has been associated with important morbidity, especially musculoskeletal, chronic pain, a significant number of sick leaves, a high consumption of medication, poor psychological well-being and worse quality of life. Research question: Explore perceptions and opinions regarding the HH's work and health problems. Estimate and evaluate HH's health determinants, the exposition to several occupational risk factors, their lifestyles and health problems and their quality of life. Methods: Design: mixed methods: (1) exploratory qualitative study (QS) including 10 semi-structured interviews and six focus groups; (2). descriptive study (DS): individual interviews and clinical medical records. Inclusion criteria: older than 18 years, had worked during the last summer season in the Balearic Islands. Analysis: QS: transcription and content analysis; DS: descriptive statistical analysis. Results: QS: Identified positive aspects of their work: timetables, relationship with co-workers, attending clients. Highlighted negative aspects: working conditions, hard physical workload, stressful duties and insufficiently rewarded. HH associated their health problems with their work; coping strategies: self-medication or visiting their general practitioner. DS: 1.043 HH included. Mean age 43.3 years, mean working years as HH 10.7 years. Mean rooms/day: 18.1 (+/- 6.5); mean beds/day: 44.6 (+/- 20.7). HH reported often pain during the last summer season: 68.2% (IC 95% 65.3-71.0) low back pain; 60.9% (IC 95% 57.8-63.8) wrist and hands; 55.3% (IC 95% 52.2-58.3) cervical. 41.6% and 35.1% self-reported regular and poor health status, respectively. Conclusion: HH perceived hard and stressful working conditions, partly justified by the number of rooms and beds made per day. They also perceived health problems related to their work. HH frequently reported pain during the last summer season. Moreover, they perceive regular or poor health status, weaker than women from the same social class do.
   Background: Gender-based violence (GBV) is a public health and human rights issue, being highly prevalent (12-51%), repetitive and having a severe impact on women's health, with a high sanitary and social cost. Primary care has a key role in detection and management. There is low detection and delay in diagnosis. There is a lack of preparation to recognize abuse, especially in the approach and action after detection. Greater awareness and sensitization is required. Research question: Can a brief specific training intervention in GBV imparted to primary health care professionals in their primary health centre increase knowledge, improve attitudes and skills? Methods: A cluster-randomized clinical trial was carried out in Vigo area primary health centres with at least 20 health care professionals. A basal evaluation was made through a validated inquiry (PREMIS), which they had to retake after three months. In the intervention centres, a clinical session was imparted. pResults: Out of 264 primary health care professionals, 145 participated. There was a 63.5% loss out of 145 professionals. A statistically significant difference was detected in the field of knowledge, increasing an average of two points on a scale from 0 to 5 in these aspects: how to make appropriate questions; connections between GBV and pregnancy; why do not they leave their partners; risk determination and phases of GBV. There was also a decrease in the idea that if the patient does not recognize gender violence, there is very little that can be done. No significant differences were detected in the detection and follow-up. Conclusion: Significant differences were found in the knowledge and attitude sections after performing the intervention to the professionals. The results support the implementation of continuous brief training on GBV in primary care.
   Background: Out-of-hours (OOH) primary care is a topic of great interest in European countries. Reasons for this are similar across borders: to guarantee continuity of care with decreasing numbers of health care workers and to guard equity in OOHcare for all patients. In OOHcare research, valid and accessible research data are needed to fill the knowledge gap. iCAREdata aims to offer valid and immediately available information from OOHcare. Research question: How feasible is it to collect, store and link data of different OOH services in Belgium and to improve data quality registration? How useful are aggregated data to inform stakeholders, to evaluate (the quality of) services in OOH care and the effects of interventions? Methods: As a first achievement, data flows, encryption and encoding were carefully designed and implemented. Solid cooperation with the federal eHealth web services as a trusted third party was crucial. Ethical approval and approval by the data protection authority was obtained. Clear agreements were established concerning access control. A strict code of conduct was agreed upon. A steering committee was established to guard the procedures. Results: First data were collected in 2015. iCAREdata now receives +/- 3000 unique patient contacts per weekend, spread over 14 general practice cooperatives, and covering about a quarter of the Flemish population. Aggregated data, directly processed, are provided weekly on . This portal site offers an overview of, among others, the latest diagnostics, drug prescriptions and workload. iCAREdata project also collects data from emergency departments in hospitals and community pharmacists and link them to evaluate further OOH primary care. Conclusion: Developing a research database on OOHcare is feasible. The iCAREdata project succeeds in an automated output every week, offering insights on the evolution of morbidity, services and effects of interventions. Careful validation and interpretation of the data is a crucial ongoing challenge.
   Background: More than half of decompensations of heart failure are attended in primary care setting. No score that helps to ascertain the short-term prognosis in these patients. Research question: To develop and validate a short-term score (30 days) to predict hospitalizations or death in patients attended in primary care as a consequence of decompensation of heart failure, based on variables easily measurable in primary care setting Methods: Prospective multinational cohort study including patients treated because of a heart failure decompensation in primary care setting. There were a derivation (Spain) and a validation cohort (nine European countries). Results: The derivation cohort included 561 patients, women were 56%, mean age was 82.2 (SD 8.03) years and 31.5% of patients were hospitalized or died in the first month. In the validation cohort, 238 patients were included, women were 54%, mean age was 79.0 (10.4) years and 26.9% of patients were hospitalized or died in the first month. According to the multivariate models, sex, age, hospital admission due to heart failure the previous year, and a heart rate greater than 100 beats/minute, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, NYHA functional stage III or IV, saturation of oxygen lower than 90% or an increase in the dyspnoea at the consultation with the General practitioner were included in the HEFESTOS-SCORE. The multivariate model including these variables showed a good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow p=.35) and discrimination (AUC 0.81, 95% CI 0.77-0.85). In the validation cohort, the model presented an adequate external validation with good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow p=.35) and discrimination (AUC 0.74, 95% CI 0.67-0.82). Conclusion: The HEFESTOS-SCORE, based on clinical and demographical variables easily measurable in primary care is a useful tool to stratify the short-term hospitalization and mortality in patients attended because of a heart failure decompensation.
   Background: Despite recommendations against long-term benzodiazepine (BZD) use, they are often prescribed during months or years in primary care. Research question: To determine facilitators and barriers that explain the variation in implementation of a primary care educational and feedback intervention targeted to general practitioners (GPs) to reduce BZDs prescriptions. Methods: A hybrid type I clinical trial: qualitative data to evaluate the implementation outcomes. Three health districts of Spain: Balearic Islands, Tarragona-Reus district (Catalonia) and Arnau de Vilanova lliria district (Valencia). Forty stakeholders (GPs) participated in five focus groups; they were selected based on their effectiveness of the intervention results: high (three groups) or low (two groups) and individual interviews to two GP of low efficiency. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was used to guide collection and analysis of qualitative data. Two researchers evaluated the qualitative data of the focus groups by the Codebook and Rating Rules of CFIR, independently. Results: Of the 31 CFIR constructs assessed, three constructs strongly distinguished between GPs with low versus high success of the intervention (intervention complexity, individual state of change, key stakeholders engaging), seven additional constructs weakly distinguished (adaptability, external policy and incentives, implementation climate, compatibility, relative priority, self-efficacy, formally appointed internal implementation leaders), 10 had insufficient data to assess and 11 were non-related to the success of the intervention. Conclusion: We identified the constructs that explain the variation in the effectiveness of the intervention; this information is relevant to redesign successful implementation strategies focused on these constructs to implement the BENZORED intervention in health services.
   Background: Despite recommendations against long-term benzodiazepine (BZD) use, they are often prescribed during months or years in primary care. Research question: To evaluate the effectiveness of a primary care educational and feedback intervention targeted to general practitioners (GPs) to reduce BZDs prescriptions. Methods: Design: A two-arm parallel cluster randomized clinical trial. Settings: Primary Healthcare centres from three health districts of Spain: Balearic Islands (IbSalut), Catalonia (Institut Catala de la Salut; Tarragona-Reus district) and Community of Valencia (Conselleria de Salut Universal; Arnau de Vilanova lliria district). Participants: All GPs from the health districts included were invited to participate. Ninety percent of the GPs accepted to participate. Intervention: GPs received an educational two hours workshop training about the rationale for prescribing BZDs and deprescribing strategies for long-term BZD users, audit and monthly feedback about their prescription and access to a support web page with information to help them and leaflets to give to the patients. Control group: GPs did not receive any component of the intervention. Outcomes: Defined daily dose (DDD)/1000 inhabitants/year (DHD) of BZDs prescribed by GP at 12 months. Proportion of long-term BZD users (>6 months) and in patients aged 65 or more at 12 months. Statistical analysis: Generalized mixed linear random effect models to account for clustering at the level of healthcare centre and all analyses were based on an intention to treat principle. Results: We included 749 GPs and 49 (6.5%) were lost to follow-up. Adjusted difference between groups in DHD at 12 months was -3.26 (-4.87;-1.65), p<.001. The differences in the proportion of long-term BZD users was -0.39 (-0.58;-0.19), p<.001 and in patients older than 65 was -0.87 (-1.35;-0.26), p=.004. Conclusion: An educational and feedback intervention targeted to GPs is effective to reduce BZD prescription in primary care.
   Background: Patients who might also go to the general practitioner (GP) frequently consult emergency departments (ED). This leads to decreased efficiency, high workload at the ED and additional costs for both government and patient. Research question: The primary outcome is the proportion of patients who enter the ED and are handled by the GP after triage. Secondary outcomes: Referral rate to the ED by the GP, proportion of patients not following the triage advice, compliance of the nurse to the triage-instructions and health insurance expenditures. Furthermore, facilitators and barriers will be studied and an incident analysis will be performed. Methods: This is a randomised controlled trial with weekends serving as clusters. Patients presenting at the ED during OOH are triaged and allocated to either ED or GP by a trained nurse using an extension to the Manchester Triage System (MTS). During control clusters, all patients remain at the ED. Data are collected using a database for OOH care (iCAREdata). Results: So far, 296 out of 2733 (11%) patients were allocated to the GP. Two-thirds (194) of these patients did go to the GP leading to a primary outcome of 7% for 14 intervention weekends. Only eight patients were referred back to the ED. Compliance of the nurse to the extended MTS was 93%, in 6% of the cases the nurse chose ED instead of GPC and in less than one percent GPC instead of ED. The nurses chose higher urgency categories and more discriminators, leading to the GP during intervention clusters. Using an automated system, these results are updated weekly, on our poster, we will show more results that are complete. Conclusion: These first results reveal a low efficiency but a high safety of the intervention. More prolonged data collection combined with a process analysis and cost efficiency study is necessary before definitive conclusions can be drawn.
   Background: Low back pain is a multifactorial condition with individual and societal impact. Psychosocial factors play a larger prognostic roll. Therefore, earlier multidisciplinary treatment strategy (physical, psychological and social/occupational) could be applied to search improvement in fear-avoidance beliefs with positive effect in the evolution of low back pain. Research question: Evaluate the effectiveness of a biopsychosocial multidisciplinary intervention (physiotherapy, cognitive-behavioural and pharmacological therapy) through the changes in fear-avoidance beliefs (FABs), in working population with sub-acute non-specific LBP, compared to usual clinical care at 3 and 12 months. Methods: A cluster randomised clinical trial, conducted in 39 Primary Health Care Centres (PHCC) in Barcelona. Participants between 18 and 65 years old (n = 369; control group =188, PHCC 26 and intervention group =181, PHCC 13). Control group received usual care, according to guidelines. Intervention group received usual care plus a biopsychosocial multidisciplinary intervention (sessions 10 hours/total). The main outcome was the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs questionnaire (FABQ). Other outcomes: Evolution to chronicity. Assessment at baseline, 3 and 12 months. Analysis was by intention to treat and analyst blinded. Multiple imputations. Results: Of the 369 enrolled patients with LBP, 421 (84.0%) provided data at the three months of follow-up, and 387 (77.2%) at 12 months. Mean age of study subjects at baseline was 45.1 (SD: 10.4) years-old and 61.2% were women. At baseline, there were no differences. Both groups showed a decrease in FABQ (FAB physical and FAB-work) at three months and twelve months, with a significant difference at long-term. At FAB-physical performance, there was no significant difference over the follow-up time and at FAB-Work, a substantial difference at 12 months between groups. Conclusion: A multidisciplinary biopsychosocial intervention showed a positive effect in FABs by improving fear behaviours and avoidance at work.
   Community participation in primary healthcare is enshrined in international policies since the 1970s and has been re-emphasised since then, most recently in the 2018 WHO Astana Declaration (). The concept comes from a social justice perspective. It emphasises that the participation of communities who experience poverty and social exclusion is essential to the development of primary health care services shaping these services and making them relevant to those with the greatest need. This is important if we are to address the well-documented Inverse Care Law. There is, however, a translational gap between policy and practice. The stability of policies for community participation in primary healthcare is patchy. The implementation of policies into conventional ways of working is patchy. Where implementation has occurred, the coverage of community participation initiatives can be patchy - not all community members are involved. The literature shows a pattern of exclusion whereby so-called 'hard to reach' groups are not adequately involved in primary healthcare decision-making. This is the case for refugees and migrants who arrive to settle and integrate into host countries in Europe. The recent WHO Strategy and Action Plan for Refugee and Migrant Health (2016; ) is a call for action to disrupt this pattern of exclusion and improve the health of refugees and migrants. Drawing on the rich tradition of participatory health research is a valuable way forward because it provides important concepts, tools and techniques for research that is more inclusive and primary care practice. This presentation will describe innovative examples of success in family practice settings from around Europe. These have brought together refugees and migrants with primary care stakeholders and enabled them to work together to introduce and sustain changes in clinical practice. This evidence can be used to guide and strengthen community participation in primary healthcare, for all.
   Background: Community participation is essential for effective implementation of research programmes in primary healthcare (PHC) but also appropriate interpretation of results and optimal delivery of subsequent care. Stakeholder engagement undertaken under defined and evaluated frameworks may be key for the establishment of concrete collaboration and communication between communities and other parties involved in research. This abstract aims to report on community and stakeholder engagement methodologies, plans and activities of European research projects conducted in Crete, Greece. Research question: Could a consensus be reached regarding the methods and tools for enhancing stakeholder engagement in community-oriented PHC research? Methods: Examined programmes included RESTORE (FP7), FRESH AIR (Horizon2020) and VIGOUR (Health Programme). Identified methodologies included Normalisation Process Theory, Participatory Learning and Action, Five Steps of Stakeholders' Engagement, establishment of Stakeholder Engagement Groups under the 9 C's model (commissioners, customers, collaborators, contributors, channels, commentators, consumers, champions, competitors) and Structured Democratic Dialogue. These were implemented to a range of stakeholders, including community members, patients, migrants, Roma populations, healthcare professionals and policy-makers. Qualitative research (focus groups, individual interviews) and Thematic Content Analysis were used for design and analysis of engagement activities. Results: In RESTORE, migrants and other stakeholders selected guidelines and training supporting cross-cultural communication in PHC consultations, based on their own needs and expectations. Community members, healthcare professionals and healthcare authorities were actively involved in FRESH AIR by identifying local priorities and contextual factors for designing project interventions, providing access to communities and supporting dissemination of project achievements. In VIGOUR, multidisciplinary stakeholders were brought together and formulated a joint ambition statement for the future of integrated care in Crete. Conclusion: Various stakeholder engagement methods with documented effects are currently available. Their systematic identification, appraisal, synthesis and consolidation may serve with enhancing community participation in PHC, sustaining research results and translating findings into appropriate actions.
   Background: Screening for prostate cancer remains controversial, implying a trade-off between benefits and harms, and a shared decision-making process has been advocated. Decision aids are evidence-based tools that improve decision quality. For limited-resource countries, translating and making cultural adaptations to high-quality decision aids is a reasonable alternative to developing new ones. Research question: We aimed to translate and culturally adapt an English language patient decision aid addressing prostate cancer screening, so that Portuguese men can use it. Methods: We followed the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control's (ECDC) five-step, stakeholder-based approach to adapting health communication materials: (1) selection of materials and process coordinators; (2) early review; (3) translation and back translation; (4) comprehension testing with cognitive semi-structured interviews; (5) proofreading. Cognitive interviews were conducted with 15 men, ages 55-69, from the Oporto district local community to refine the decision aid after its translation. Content analysis was performed using Ligre (TM) software. Results: Five main themes are presented: informational content, information comprehension, socio-cultural appropriateness, feelings and primary message, and personal perspective concerning prostate cancer screening. For each theme, illustrative quotes extracted from men's interviews are presented. Most men found the translated version of the decision aid to be clear, comprehensive and appropriate for its target population, albeit some suggested that medical terms could be a barrier. The data collected from men's interviews allowed the researchers to clarify concepts and expand existing content. Conclusion: The final version of the decision aid can be used in the real world clinical setting and our ECDC based approach can be replicated by other workgroups to translate and culturally adapt decision aids.
   What are we talking about when we talk about value? In 2006, Michael Porter and Elizabeth O. Teisberg published; Redefining Health Care, Creating Value-Based Competition on Results, Harvard Business School Press. Affirming that payers and providers, including doctors and nurses, are very concerned in demonstrating that they work a lot, and very little, or nothing, in assessing what their work contributes to the health of people and communities. Michael Porter is famous in the business world for his work on competitiveness based on the value of products and services. He has introduced this concept in the provision of health services, all summarised in a phrase: Health systems should seek to obtain the maximum possible value for the health of people for every dollar they spend. However, to define the value in healthcare, the patient must be introduced into the equation, so, in Porterian terms, the value is the perception that people have about clinical effectiveness and the costs of therapeutic processes. Clinical effectiveness is measurable from epidemiology (to be readmitted to a hospital fewer times or living longer); value, on the other hand, is reflected by people's experience. We need to ask questions such as do patients with advanced diseases want to live longer, or they want to enjoy the highest quality of life possible. Depending on the response, we can develop different delivery models. What is value-based healthcare? According to NEJM Catalyst, Value-based healthcare is a healthcare delivery model in which providers, including hospitals and physicians, are paid based on patient health outcomes (). Under value-based care agreements, providers are rewarded for helping patients improve their health, reduce the effects and incidence of chronic disease, and live healthier lives in an evidence-based way. How to achieve a Value-Based Healthcare Model The following six drivers are the key to make a primary health care system a value-based healthcare model: 1. Prioritising patient-centred care. 2. From clinical pathways to care delivery value chains. 3. Promoting the right care and reducing medical overuse. 4. Turning a fragmented model into another integrated model. 5. Creating the enabling environment for healthcare transformation. 6. Fostering community health. How to develop a Value-Based Community Health Michael Marmot states that if the determinants of health are mostly social, solutions must also be social, so to improve the quality of community life, political systems require economic, housing, education, security and infrastructure programs (Am J Public Health. 2014;104:S517-S519). Nevertheless, the healthcare system must know how to adjust resources according to the social circumstances of each community and to understand how to provide a health-oriented vision of all the social programs. On the other hand, community health is an intervention model that aims to improve the health of a defined community that should operate from primary care services to adjust their actions to the social reality of each territory.
   Background: Geriatric care needs to be increased with growing elderly populations. The Borgholm jurisdiction in the Baltic Island of oland (Kalmar region) has an older than average senior population and had difficulties recruiting primary care physicians (PCPs) resulting in high elderly hospital care consumption. Research question: Could a new model of geriatric care be able to decrease the hospital care needs of Borgholm as compared to the rest of Kalmar region? Methods: A new model of care was developed in Borgholm 2016-2017 where the PCP list was limited to 1000 patients, daily slots for PCP home care visits could be booked by community nurses or ambulance nurses and PCPs had daily anticipatory care planning contacts with Kalmar hospital staff. Results: Between 2014 and 2018, Borgholm home care patients >75 years old increased by 70% vs. a 2% decrease for the rest of Kalmar region. Similarly, Kalmar emergency department visits decreased by 19% in Borgholm vs. 9% increase for the rest of Kalmar. Also, Kalmar hospital care episodes decreased 7% in Borgholm vs. 13% increase for the rest of Kalmar; Kalmar hospital outpatient visits decreased 8% in Borgholm vs. 21% increase for the rest of Kalmar; total care consumption for >75 years old decreased 4% in Borgholm vs. a 10% increase for the rest of Kalmar region. Conclusion: A new geriatric care model consisting of a comprehensive collaboration between strengthened primary care and community care, hospital care and ambulance care was associated with a reduction in total care consumption for senior citizens in a rural Swedish jurisdiction.
   Background: Primary health care, the general practitioner, plays a critical role for early identification and care of patients with dementia. Early diagnosis of dementia allows starting therapy and improving the quality of life of the patients. Research question: To estimate the prevalence and care of patients with dementia in North Macedonia. Methods: Forty-six general practitioners (GPs) surgeries from 20 cities in Macedonia took part in the project. All individuals age over 65 years with a diagnosis of dementia were identified from GP electronic disease registers. Results: Based on the diagnosis, 450 (3.5%) patients were identified from a total population of 12,926 over 65s. The most common dementia was Alzheimer's dementia 294 (65.3%) followed by vascular dementia 27.11%. The average age of respondents in the study was 77.5 +/- 8.2 years, with 50% patients under the age of 79 years, 65.6% were female and 68.4% were with elementary school. In the entire sample, most of the patients diagnosed with dementia 195 (43.3%) said they lived with another family member. The most common risk factor was hypertension (85.1%), followed by stroke/ transitory ischemic attacks (29.3%) and equal percentage, i.e. 26.4% of patients had high levels of cholesterol and diabetes. To 242 (53.8%) acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were prescribed (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine), 77 (17.1%) memantine, while 247 (54.9%) another OTC therapy. 227 (50.4%) reported that they did not receive treatment. An additional analysis of the reasons for not receiving treatment was made on this sample of patients who did not receive treatment. It was found that in the majority of these patients (more than 50%) the reason for not receiving therapy was that it was not prescribed, in 142 (62.6%). Conclusion: This is the first national representative study of dementia prevalence in North Macedonia. Those data can provide information for healthcare needs people with dementia.
   Background: Emotional experience for medical students during clinical internships is often ignored. Yet, its influence on professional skills is certain. Research question: 'What is the emotional experience of second and third-year medical students during their first clinical internship? How do they perceive the management of their experience by their supervisors?' Methods: A qualitative study was conducted with 12 students in their second or third year of medical training at the University of Lille, in France, between 2016 and 2019. Interviews were carried out comprehensively for a total of 17 hours. Following a grounded theory approach, the analysis terminated when data were sufficient to offer a conclusive model. Results: Emotional experience during clinical internship was rich and intense. It was most often ignored and was not taken into account in the development of professional skills. The organized management was deficient. Informal training existed: when a wilful student met a dedicated teacher. Students would have welcomed a possibility to experience intense emotions in a protective environment, and only then in an empowering environment. They expressed the same desire about early exchanges on the experiences of the internship. A modelling of the informants' emotional experiences was realized in the form of three diagrams. Conclusion: Students ask to be challenged to face patients, and then to be listened to about it. Possible interventions are trauma prevention and detection of malaise in the workplace; teaching of humanist values; providing experience and reflexivity through new pedagogical means (such as cinema, theatre, literature, writing), or relational means (such as exchange groups, companionship, solidarity commitment, immersive internships and tutoring); and training supervisors.
   Background: Oral anticoagulants (OAC) reduce the risk for stroke and death from all causes in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Research question: To explore adherence rates to OAC among patients with NVAF and to compare head-to-head adherence rate of different medications in long-term chronic use. Methods: We conducted a population-based cohort study Clalit Health Services, Israel. All patients, 30 years and over, with a diagnosis of NVAF before 2016 and were treated with OAC were included. We included patients that filled at least one prescription per year in the three consecutive years 2016-2018. We analysed all prescriptions that were filled for the medications from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017. We considered purchasing of at least nine monthly prescriptions during 2017 as 'good medication adherence.' Results: Twenty-six thousand and twenty-nine patients with NVAF who were treated with OAC were identified. Ten thousand and two hundred and eighty-four (39.5%) were treated with apixaban, 6321 (24.3%) were treated with warfarin, 6290 (24.1%) were treated with rivaroxaban 3134 (12.0%) were treated with dabigatran. Rates of good medication adherence were 88.9% for rivaroxaban, 84.9% for apixaban, 83.6% for dabigatran and 55.8% for warfarin (p<.0001). Good adherence with OAC was associated with lower LDL cholesterol and glucose levels. Advanced age was associated with higher adherence rates (p<.001). SES was not associated with medication adherence. Conclusion: Adherence rates to DOAC among patients with NVAF are high and are higher than the adherence rate to warfarin. It should be taken into consideration when choosing OAC treatment for NVAF.
   Background: In France, cervical cancer screening by pap-smears should be conducted triennially. Screening statistics are based on the number of cytology examinations of smears reimbursed by the Health Insurance appearing in the claim databases. The percentage of screened women is lower based on these data than on declarative surveys. If surveys are overestimating the number of screened women, it is likely that claim databases underestimate it. Research question: The primary objective was to determine the underestimation of screened women in claim databases. The secondary purpose was to estimate the proportion of female patients not reachable by their GP for a cervical cancer screening in an organized screening trial. Methods: The population was the 6327 female patients aged 30-65 years of the 24 GP investigators of the PaCUDAHL-Ge trial. We compared the lists of their female patients that had no cytology of Pap test reimbursed during the three prior years, extracted from the Health Insurance claim databases in 2015 and 2018. We selected the patients appearing on both lists meaning they had not responded to the invitation of their GP to be screened in the trial. We searched in the GPs' records valid reasons not to be screened (hysterectomy, history of cervical lesion, pregnancy, other conditions making screening irrelevant) or evidence of screening. Results: The total number of 'unscreened' women in 2018 was 2731, 1737 patients appeared on both lists, 1522 could be included for analysing, 65 had been screened, 95 had hysterectomy, three had a history of cervical lesion, nine were pregnant and 10 had other conditions making screening irrelevant, 166 patients were lost to view. Conclusion: Based on GPs' records, health insurance claim databases underestimate the number of screened women by 7.6%. The percentage of patients not responding to the invitation of their GP to be screened in the PaCUDAHL-Ge trial is 24.18%.
   Background: Over the past decade, the amount of digital data created by humans with or without connected tools has grown exponentially. The field of primary care (PC) did not escape this digitization, nor the use of Big Data algorithms. To evaluate the results of Big Data research in PC it seemed useful to identify which algorithms are used. Research question: What are the algorithms used for Big Data research in PC research and how are they described? Methods: Systematic review of the literature according to the recommendations of the PRISMA guide. A search equation using the following MeSH terms 'big data, data mining, Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, Deep Learning, Neural Networks Natural Language Processing, general practice, electronic health records, health records' has been applied to the PUBMED database. After a selection of the titles and article summaries according to the inclusion criteria, the full versions of the eligible articles were read and analysed. Referenced articles of the sources articles were added to the analysis. The algorithms described in the articles were extracted and analysed. Results: In total, 778 articles were identified, 169 were eligible for full reading and 26 articles were finally selected. The algorithms listed in the articles are poorly described. The description is usually limited to a general explanation about how the algorithm works. Seven articles gave a partial description of the algorithm; a logic diagram was given in four articles and the codes in only two. Actually, only one article fully describes the algorithm with its mathematical description, its code and its logic diagram. Conclusion: Big Data algorithms in PC are not satisfactorily described. The lack of reproducibility is not compatible with a consistent scientific approach. Researchers should provide more information about the way they extract and analyse their data to give their readers more confidence in Big Data.
   Background: As a collaborative project of the Family Practice Depression and Multimorbidity group of European General Practice Research Network, the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25) scale was identified as valid, reproducible, effective and easy to use. Subsequently, it has been translated and adapted to 13 languages, including Castilian. Currently, the scale is being validated in different languages. Research question: What are the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of HSCL-25 (HSCL-25e) for depression detection in Primary Care? Methods: HSCL-25e was administered to outpatients recruited by their physicians in six health centres involved in Spanish EIRA3 study, a trial to promote healthy behaviours in people aged from 45 to 75. Patients complimented HSCL-25 themselves. Sample size was calculated with R package (pROC). Statistical analysis: responsiveness was analysed with missing data and detecting ceiling and floor effects for the items. Principal component analysis (PCA) was done to determine the dimensions of HSCL-25e. Item-total correlation, Cronbach's alpha (global and dimensions coefficient) and squared multiple correlation were carried out to calculate internal consistency. Results: Seven hundred and sixty-nine patients out of 806 complimented HSCL-25e, 738 answered to all of the items. No patterns of missing answers were found. No ceiling effects, expected floor effect in item 18. Item 17 was the most consistent one and item 24 was the lower one. All items showed positive discrimination index for both cut-off points (1.55 and 1.75). PCA indicated two factors; 13 items corresponding to depression dimension and the other 12 items corresponding to anxiety subscale. Global Cronbach's alpha was 0.92 (0.88 calculated for depression dimension and 0.84 for anxiety dimension). Conclusion: The HSCL-25e has excellent psychometric properties when applied to Primary Care population. It has two dimensions as the original version, although the items included are not exactly the same. There are more item coincidences with the French version.
   Background: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the first mortality cause worldwide with 17.5 million death in 2012. Spices (Scaling-up Packages of Interventions for CVD prevention in selected sites in Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa) gathered five countries around CVD primary prevention interventions, especially for populations with low access to prevention and health care system. In France, a rural area where people were more deprived and with a low settlement of general practitioners (GPs) fitted with the project. Research question: What are the barriers and the facilitators for cardiovascular primary prevention implementation from caregivers and patients' point of view of a deprived rural area? Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted until theoretical saturation of data. Purposive samplings of GPs, patients, patients' families, nurses and pharmacists were designed. Five interview guides explored cardiovascular prevention, cardiovascular health promotion in the setting, actors of CVD prevention, capacities for CVD prevention, patients' and healthcare professionals' representations, barriers and facilitators in implementing CVD prevention, possible solutions. Guides were adapted concurrently to the analysis. A blinded thematic analysis and a mind-mapping were achieved for each group. Results: Thirteen GPS, 11 pharmacists', 14 nurses, 12 patients' and 12 patients' family members' interviews were achieved. Professionals highlighted a disconnection between them and national prevention programs, lack of time, payment and training for CVD prevention. Countryside was either protective or aggressive regarding CVD risk balancing gardening and space against isolation and lack of structures. GPs had poor connections with the community. Patients described their recklessness and feeling of invulnerability until their CVD appeared. Families could be a barrier to CVD prevention and lifestyle change. Risky behaviours were handed down from one generation to another. Conclusion: Innovative interventions for Spices should focus on these community specificities and individual behavioural strategies in contrast with the six national plans addressing CVD in France. These plans solely concentrate on dissemination of prevention messages and knowledge, which is of little use according to this survey.
